[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.880]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.160]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.920]   I'm Tim Chen, and today, we're talking about
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.800]   how to be a social content marketer.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.260]   Now, it goes without saying, knowing who your audience is,
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.720]   knowing what they're looking for,
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.820]   and then authoring content that they'll actually read
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.600]   is really, really difficult.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.360]   And there's a reason why we aren't all influencers
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.080]   with hundreds of thousands of followers
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600]   that read our content.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.920]   I'm certainly not one of them,
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.000]   and it's not due to lack of effort.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.900]   So today, we're going to talk to someone
[00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.640]   who has achieved this.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.420]   We'll be joined by Paul Patron,
[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.880]   a senior content marketing manager at LinkedIn,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.800]   and he runs LinkedIn Sales Solutions'
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.220]   owned channel strategy, where he's the blog editor
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.720]   and owner of social content
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.880]   and the recently launched newsletter.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.980]   Altogether, this reaches over 400,000 people monthly.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.380]   In this video, he's going to give us practical insights
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.700]   into topics like the importance of immediate payoff
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.580]   for the reader, examples of blogs that did
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.740]   and did not perform well,
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.760]   and then he'll talk about his own career journey
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.000]   and how he discovered a passion for writing.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760]   All right, let's get started.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.740]   Joining us today to talk about content marketing
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.720]   is Paul Patron.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.300]   How you doing, Paul?
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.140]   - I'm doing great.
[00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.020]   Thanks for having me, Tim.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.300]   - Dude, I'm so glad you're here today.
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.340]   You know, I've worked with you.
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.940]   I've really admired how you do content marketing.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.260]   So can you tell us a little bit about your role today
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.780]   and how long you've been doing it?
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.780]   - Sure.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.300]   So right now, I currently lead our blog and social efforts
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.940]   for LinkedIn Sales Solutions,
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.420]   which is roughly a $1.2 billion business,
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660]   primarily selling Sales Navigator.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.460]   And I've bounced around a few different roles at LinkedIn,
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.980]   primarily content marketing,
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.580]   although I've done some product marketing too.
[00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.960]   And I've been at LinkedIn for eight years.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.860]   So a little bit about my job now.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.260]   Basically, my job is to build an audience
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.540]   of sales professionals.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.420]   And I do that through our blog and social channels.
[00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.860]   We wanna connect with sales professionals.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.940]   We wanna keep them engaged.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.380]   We wanna build this community of existing customers
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.140]   and people who are prospective customers as well,
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.940]   and keep them coming back and wanting to learn more
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.940]   about sales best practices, how to sell more effectively.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.300]   And then we also pepper in, of course,
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.100]   some best practices around Sales Navigator
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.340]   and how to get the most out of our product as well.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.180]   - Got it.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.340]   So when you're saying you're building this community,
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.580]   so this is primarily through engagement on your blogs.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.900]   Is that true?
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420]   - Blog and--
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.700]   - And social.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.540]   - LinkedIn, yes.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.380]   - LinkedIn, okay.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.260]   - LinkedIn, I would say, is almost the focus
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980]   because we have more sales pros use LinkedIn
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.580]   more than any other type of professional.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.380]   So there's this huge community there.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.940]   And we're looking to tap into that community
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.540]   and build awareness with them of Sales Navigator
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.260]   and just kind of who we are and what we stand for.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260]   - Can you tell me a little bit about,
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.780]   obviously the community in LinkedIn can be very diverse,
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.620]   right?
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.780]   There's all these different people and different personas.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.140]   And so how do you go about defining your target audience?
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.540]   And then how do you then, whether it's through,
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.820]   you know, journey mapping or understanding their top tasks
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.580]   or what use cases that they care about,
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.540]   like how do you then pair the individual to topics
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140]   that you think is highly relevant to them?
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.860]   - Yeah, I think the key to good content marketing
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.860]   is empathy for the person you're writing to, to your point.
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.980]   So really our audience is our core,
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.420]   is the core of the business as well.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.420]   So for us, that's 25 to 45 year old sales professionals.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.460]   I would say high tech and finance is the focus,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.300]   but we really serve a wide range.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.780]   But when I think about who I'm writing for,
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.820]   I think about somebody who's either an SDR or an AE,
[00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.940]   who's hungry to advance in their career,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.460]   is hungry to get better at selling
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.180]   because unlike other professions,
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.340]   there's an immediate payoff.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.660]   The better you get at sales, the more money you make.
[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.900]   So I really think about that as I'm designing content,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.740]   like what would they care about?
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.220]   And then of course I talk to sales professionals
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.340]   all the time.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.940]   I hear research from our product marketing team
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.700]   on what our sales professionals care about.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.460]   And honestly, part of it is trial and error.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.900]   Like part of it is like,
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.100]   I produce a lot of blogs and a lot of social posts
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.140]   and you see, hey, this topic resonates,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.140]   this topic doesn't resonate.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.620]   And I've written for a lot of audiences in my time
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.620]   and it's always the same process.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.700]   Try to speak to the people who actually do that job,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.580]   try to get whatever market research you can.
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.940]   And then a lot of it's quite frankly, trial and error.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.260]   - Cool, so you said two things in there
[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.700]   that really kind of piqued my interest.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.220]   One is around kind of gathering and soliciting feedback
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.100]   to validate what your customers are looking for.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.780]   And I definitely want to focus on that.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.700]   And then you talked about how you're measuring engagement
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.300]   as a way of seeing efficacy of your content
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300]   or making sure they're engaging.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.220]   So I got a question for you.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.380]   So, it seems like when you're describing to me,
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.700]   whether it's your partners in product marketing
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.140]   or the sales rep themselves,
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.500]   maybe there's a general alignment to maybe their agreement
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.220]   on what the customer is looking for.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.260]   Now, a lot of companies may not have that luxury.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.820]   You could be in a very complex B2B company
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.460]   where your product marketing
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.380]   has a very specific point of view
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.940]   that may differ from another organization.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.660]   Have you encountered that in your current role
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.980]   or previous jobs?
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.700]   And how do you kind of marry the two together
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.980]   and really kind of come up with the agreed
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.940]   kind of source of truth
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.740]   to identify what they're looking for?
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.260]   - Yes, I mean, I've worked in organizations
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.300]   that had no product marketing.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.740]   So the whole funnel.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.740]   And then I think the ultimate source of truth
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500]   is what's performing on the channel.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.340]   That's the source of truth.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.180]   - Okay.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.140]   - I mean, granted,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.780]   it needs to be related to the business, of course.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.300]   But like, if you're seeing, let's just use,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.700]   I'll just continue the example.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.500]   So let's see, we're seeing a lot of,
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.420]   with sales professionals specifically,
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.660]   we see a lot do really successful
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.460]   around like sort of the emotional side of sales.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.620]   Like how do you bounce back from a tough call
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.500]   or how do you bounce back from missing quota?
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   How do you deal with rejection?
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.060]   Now, is that a direct tie to our product?
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.060]   Somewhat, but not 100% as like prospecting would be.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.500]   Now, we talk about sales prospecting,
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.660]   we wanna connect with the sales pro.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.580]   If we don't build a community,
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.180]   like our efforts are meaningless
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.420]   'cause then we're like talking to nobody.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.420]   So you need to look at the engagement numbers
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.060]   really closely and see what is actually resonating
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.780]   with the audience and use that as your source of truth
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.340]   versus even the research you get back from PMM or whoever.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.820]   - Yeah, and how are you measuring like success?
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.660]   Are you looking at clicks?
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.900]   Like are you looking at balanced rates?
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.740]   Are you looking at heat maps?
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.700]   Like what kind of tools you use
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.500]   and what numbers, what KPIs matter to you?
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.340]   - Yeah, so there's a few
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.780]   and I've used a bunch in my times in content marketing.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.380]   I think in social, you have a lot more metrics you can use.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.540]   You can see how many people engage the post.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.420]   You can see the sentiment around that post.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.580]   You can see if those posts, if people click down through,
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.700]   if they go on to convert, although I would not recommend,
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.620]   and we can talk about this later,
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.900]   I would not recommend conversions as a key metric
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.980]   for content marketing for a lot of reasons.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.820]   - Okay. - But we can talk
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.980]   about that in a second.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.700]   In blog, it's a little more limited
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.820]   'cause you don't have as much visibility into your audience,
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.260]   but it's, you're really relying on views.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.380]   I think time on pages are underrated stat.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.500]   Like are people, are they, is it clickbait
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.940]   or are there people actually like syncing in
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.220]   and reading the content?
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.180]   And then if you have some sort of blog newsletter
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.780]   or subscribing is really critical
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.180]   because that shows that like they're getting so much value
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.380]   that they want more of it.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.940]   - Yeah. - So I think in some ways
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.780]   for blog, I would say views is generally your true North,
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.100]   but subscribers can actually be an even better metric.
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.100]   - Yeah, you said something earlier
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.900]   that I really want to revisit again
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.380]   'cause it's so important.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.700]   You know, you're talking about like, you know,
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.180]   whether that's empathetic writing
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.220]   or kind of putting the user or customer truly first,
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.700]   that's actually really hard
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.700]   'cause it's easy for a company
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.180]   who's passionate about their product
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.060]   to want to talk about their product first.
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.540]   And you're going completely different way, right?
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.900]   You're trying to talk about something that's relatable
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.500]   that seems like it's taking a topic that's relevant
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.980]   and talking about maybe a editorial piece
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.180]   or a story or narrative
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.180]   to kind of build that kind of a story.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.540]   And then you lead them into
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.940]   maybe why your product matters, right?
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.580]   Can you share some examples of maybe like
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.300]   an example of a topic that worked really well
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.820]   in terms of getting engagement
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.500]   versus one that really fell flat?
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.980]   You know, like maybe it was a pure product push
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.100]   or something that just no one cared about.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.260]   - I can think of, so first off,
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.660]   pure product pushes almost always fall flat
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.820]   unless there's, I would say actually in my current role,
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.660]   when we have updates about Sales Navigator
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.780]   and we can talk about immediate payoff,
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.860]   then it actually does perform well
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.940]   because they're just so hungry
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.780]   to learn how to use the tool better.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.740]   But to answer your question,
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.420]   I'll give you a very specific example.
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.340]   So I think the key is in writing good content
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.380]   is you need to identify pain.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.260]   You need to figure out like what's something
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.140]   that like somebody's struggling with right now
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.020]   that they want to click on and figure out how to solve it.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.500]   So, and if the more immediate that pain is,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.820]   the more clicks and the more successful
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.180]   and the more engaged it's going to be.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.420]   So I give you a very specific example.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.260]   Back when we were working together, Tim,
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.740]   I worked with somebody else on the team, Carrie,
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.380]   on this campaign and it was my first big effort
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.980]   on like a big editorial campaign.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.460]   I was really excited about it
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.300]   and it was called The Future of Skills,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.820]   the skills that would be popular in five years.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.660]   And we interviewed all of these great people.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.020]   We interviewed Reid Hoffman.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.820]   We interviewed our head of sales at LinkedIn at the time.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.260]   I think we interviewed 40 people
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.380]   all with really impressive credentials.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.340]   And we're like, what are the skills
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.540]   that are going to be popular in five years?
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.900]   And it was good.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.060]   I actually revisited it.
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.580]   We did this in 2017.
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.900]   I revisited it in 2022 and it was amazingly accurate.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.980]   Like one of them was like the sales guy was like,
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.140]   virtual meetings is going to be even more critical than ever.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.220]   Now, of course he didn't know pandemic was going to happen.
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.420]   But so anyway, it was strong writing.
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.620]   It was, the points were good.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.140]   Everything was good.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.820]   And the campaign couldn't have done worse.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.860]   It was embarrassing.
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.540]   It was my first big one.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.540]   And I was like, why?
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.340]   Like, it sounds so good.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.940]   And it's like, 'cause there's not an immediate payoff.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.300]   Yes, like if I were to ask you
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.660]   what's going to make you successful in five years
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.700]   and granted I know you can build towards that and everything
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.500]   but there's not that immediate pain that,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.180]   and we had like, it was all,
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.700]   this was to give a little more context.
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.460]   This was back when I worked for LinkedIn Learning
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.900]   which taught all these courses and all these skills.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.060]   So the thought was, well, this will inspire people
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.340]   to want to take these courses
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.140]   because they want to get prepared for five years from now.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.300]   But the reality is people don't think like that.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.300]   They want to put out the fire
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.060]   that's burning inside them right now.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.900]   - Yeah.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.660]   - So we altered.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.060]   And then what we did was,
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.060]   so they kind of gave me one more chance to like,
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.300]   all right, we'll do one more of these sort of campaigns.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.660]   I felt the pressure.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.700]   So we did something around the skills companies need most
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.060]   where we identified the skills right now
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.100]   that companies were most hiring for
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.140]   based on this really cool LinkedIn data.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.740]   And that killed.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.300]   That was probably the most successful campaign I ever did.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.460]   And then we did it again next year and it was even bigger.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.780]   And it, again, it addressed that immediate pain
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.580]   and it was a direct tie to the product.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.420]   It was, hey, these are the skills companies are hiring for.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.140]   This is how to learn the skill on LinkedIn Learning.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.500]   So it's okay to have a complete straight line
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.580]   to the product but you better match it real closely
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.580]   to something that's a pain in somebody's life right now.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.620]   Not something that's potentially a pain
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.220]   or philosophically a pain.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.300]   - No, that's a really good point.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.660]   I'm thinking about even the blogs
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.060]   that my teams have written in the past
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.540]   and you're totally right.
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.540]   They're like, there's two types of blogs
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.740]   that seem to perform really well.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.780]   One is timely and relevant to key events
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.260]   happening in market right now, right?
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.660]   So in my world, the previous was around like,
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.940]   like privacy and security and like online,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.980]   like identification and protection, right?
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.420]   And not being DDoS attacked.
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.100]   So like having people aware of like,
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.860]   hey, this attack just happened.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.100]   Like, here's what you need to know about it.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.620]   Like, that was really practical.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.380]   But the one you're saying is even better,
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.100]   which is like, you need to remember
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.900]   that users are trying to get their jobs done
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.700]   at the end of the day, right?
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.460]   And so they're trying to solve for something specifically.
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.820]   And if you talk broad stretches, like brushes,
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.060]   like marketing speak usually turns people off, right?
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.020]   It's like, connect with me as a human,
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.700]   use my language, help me figure out
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.140]   how you're gonna make my job better
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.420]   and tell me how to do it.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.060]   'Cause then that actually establishes you
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.860]   as a subject matter expert, right?
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.700]   Or thought leader.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.220]   And again, that kind of probably leads
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.740]   to more repeat readership in your content
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.140]   or maybe update and subscribes, et cetera.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.220]   So, Paul, you have like actually really interesting history
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.100]   to me for your career journey.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.420]   'Cause, you know, when I'm thinking about the skills
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.740]   required to be a successful content marketer.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.900]   Now like, you're double downing in blog
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.780]   and social content for viewers.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.500]   You know, there's other types of content marketing as well.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.140]   There's eBooks, creating webinars, infographics.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.980]   There's a lot of ways or packages
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980]   you can put your content in
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.500]   and I'll create more content around that
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.060]   to help you guys understand how to do that.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.820]   But in your world, can you help us understand
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.060]   what skills, both hard and soft,
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.340]   you believe are really critical for this role?
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.100]   And then I would love to kind of even rewind the clock
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.660]   a little bit, kind of talk about your career journey.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.020]   'Cause you started somewhere totally different
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.180]   than where you are now, but all the skills
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.100]   you kind of gained along the way,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.380]   they're all somehow thematically relevant, right?
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.620]   And it kind of led you to where we are today.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.580]   So can you, yeah, start us with the skills
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.020]   and you believe are required
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.380]   and then talk about your journey.
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.580]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.900]   So first off I'll say,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.060]   although I've done mostly blog and social in my career,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.580]   I've done eBooks, I've done live shows,
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.860]   I've done webinars, I've done it all.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.940]   And I actually think I've done videos
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.380]   and I think the skills needed to create good content
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.020]   across all those mediums are very similar.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.020]   So I think the really critical skills is,
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.820]   the hard skills is,
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.300]   and it doesn't matter what type of content you're doing,
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.540]   you need to be able to,
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.980]   I would say the number one skill you need,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.820]   believe it or not,
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.220]   is the ability to take a bunch of information,
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.940]   distill it down and figure out
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.340]   what's gonna be interesting to the audience.
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.380]   So like, that's what we had to do
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.900]   and I'll get to it in a second in my career as a reporter,
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.740]   but that's what we had to do was take a lot of information,
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.500]   okay, this is a lot of stuff here,
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.540]   a lot of angles we could go here,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.780]   what's actually gonna matter to our audience?
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.060]   And I think the best way to do that is,
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.100]   I think of this thing my journalism professor
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.260]   told me one time is,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.140]   he said, imagine you're on a boat
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.660]   and the boat is casting offshore
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.660]   and there's somebody on shore
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.460]   and you have just one sentence
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.900]   you can shout to that person on shore
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.980]   before the boat is out of earshot.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.900]   And like, what is that one sentence gonna be?
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.780]   So before you create anything,
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.700]   whether it's an ebook or a video
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.420]   or a blog or a social post,
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.900]   you need to be like crystal clear
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.820]   on what that one message is
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.100]   because if you don't have that,
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.220]   you're gonna have a very unstructured post.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.980]   So that's the most important.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.340]   It's actually kind of, I would describe it
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.060]   almost as like an analytical skill
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.980]   to be able to boil it down.
[00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.260]   The other skills you need, I would say,
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.860]   is obviously the ability to write
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.340]   and again, that applies to all types of content.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.500]   And I really think the only way to become a good writer
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.660]   is to just write a lot.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:58.100]   You do need the building on the analytical skill.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.020]   You need the ability to understand data
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.460]   and figure out trends from that data
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.700]   and apply it to your writing.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.580]   So you're reaching bigger and bigger audiences, ideally.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:12.660]   Those are the main ones.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.140]   And then on the soft skill,
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.900]   which I think are probably equally important,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.140]   not more important.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.460]   One of the big soft skills you really need to learn,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.420]   which I struggled with earlier in my career
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.460]   and then it got beat out of me basically,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.980]   was the ability to take really strong feedback.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.860]   Even in, I've been doing writing for 15 years
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.140]   and I ghost write for people all the time
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.740]   and everybody has different opinions
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.260]   and everybody has,
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   most people have really strong feedback.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.620]   And it doesn't necessarily mean that every single thing,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.740]   every piece of feedback you get is right.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.500]   But you need to be able to accept the feedback.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.060]   Some of it does, is right.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.620]   And some of it you need to learn from other,
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.940]   you just need to chalk it up as,
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.860]   hey, it's their perspective.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.620]   But either way, you need to be able to accept
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.260]   a lot of feedback and not take it personally.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.380]   So that's critical.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.140]   You need to be able to build partnerships,
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.100]   which is so important.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.500]   And another thing that I wasn't like,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.220]   I was kind of like a little bit of a lone wolf,
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.820]   probably still somewhat are,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.380]   but like you really need to bring people along
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.460]   and be able to build partnerships.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.020]   Otherwise you're gonna be seen as just a writer
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.420]   and you don't want that in your career.
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.620]   You wanna be able to build these larger initiatives
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.780]   and be part of something larger.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.500]   You need to have some sort of like strategic view
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.580]   of what the business is,
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.140]   which again was something I had to learn over time.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:36.900]   And I would say, I mean, there's many more,
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.220]   but I would say those are the main ones.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.980]   If I had to distill it down to one hard and one soft,
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.500]   soft skill, most important ability to take feedback,
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.540]   not take it personally and incorporate,
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.380]   not lose your confidence either, which is also hard,
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.300]   and then be able to put it back in.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.220]   And the hard skill again,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.180]   just be able to take a lot of information and distill out,
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   I kind of called the bones of it,
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.620]   but what's the main thing that you really wanna get across?
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.820]   - Yeah, and I really liked that.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.980]   You know, the kind of hard skill you mentioned
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.180]   just now around being able to take
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.740]   a lot of complex information
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.540]   and distill it into the one point that people care about.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.460]   I would say that applies broadly
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.460]   as an effective communicator in business, right?
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.300]   How many times have we been asked
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.700]   to put a presentation together for a manager or whatever?
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   And being in the weeds,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.260]   there's so much we wanna talk about
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.180]   'cause we're passionate about it
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.060]   and we should have a strong point of view,
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.220]   but that audience only has time to remember
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.300]   one or two things they're gonna say.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.540]   And so being able to practice restraint
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.620]   and kind of bubbling up just the first,
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.220]   you know, one or two things that matter to them
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.100]   is really important.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.500]   And as a matter of fact, Paul,
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.020]   I don't know if you remember,
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.540]   when we started at LinkedIn together at the same time,
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.060]   in that time in my career, you know,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.980]   I was very much an individual contributor,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.020]   really passionate about my work.
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.860]   I had a lot of work to do
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.100]   in the way of presenting my thoughts.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.500]   You know, my mind ran a mile a minute
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.460]   and my presentations looked like that.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.180]   You know, I would create a slide
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.340]   that would be way too verbose.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.540]   And I kind of leveraged too many funny pictures as well,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.900]   but that's just my personality.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.620]   But like, I think over time,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.980]   being just admitting to myself that,
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.540]   "Hey, look, this is a thing I need to work on."
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.340]   The thing that I appreciate with even you
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.900]   is accountability, right?
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.060]   'Cause people are gonna wonder,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.180]   I am a talkative type,
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.220]   but a lot of things you say,
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.140]   "How do I bring it down?"
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.340]   Letting a few friends or close people who you trust
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.540]   give you feedback is important.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.740]   I remember a lot of times in the beginning,
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.780]   I would distill my presentations down.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.780]   I would do like a dry run through you
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.860]   or I'd do a dry run through my manager at the time
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.860]   and say, "Hey, look, does this make sense?"
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.220]   Or even before I presented something,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.380]   I'd be like, "Hey, by the way, before we get started,
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.900]   I'm trying to work on bringing a better presenter.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.300]   So look out for these three things.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.980]   And just let me know after the fact, you know,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.820]   and I'll deal with that."
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.140]   And then I would go on.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.380]   So I think the same thing applies for you
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.900]   and your content writing, right?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.500]   Again, I'm sending feedback
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.700]   and kind of like iron sharpening iron.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.700]   And I think the ability to take constructive feedback,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.940]   like that's so valuable.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.460]   Cool, so you kind of teased it.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.820]   So you're a reporter before.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.260]   So I'm kind of curious.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.700]   So there's a lot of people who are wondering,
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.740]   like, "Hey, look, I want to make a career shift
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.940]   into let's say content marketing."
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.580]   And of course, content marketing
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.220]   is a very broad category, right?
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.820]   And they may have some skills that they'd be more tangible,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.940]   but they may be maybe intimidated
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.180]   'cause you've mentioned analytical mindset
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.180]   and they may not see themselves as the analytical person.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.540]   What I don't want them to take away is,
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.740]   "Okay, I'm gonna just rule myself out
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.700]   and self-select out this job function or category."
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.580]   So can you tell us about your evolutionary career?
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.700]   'Cause I think that's important for people
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.300]   'cause they might be following a similar journey
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.740]   even though the starting point looks different.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.980]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.700]   So I had a kind of a unique journey to LinkedIn.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.140]   So I'll start, I won't tell the whole story,
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.980]   but I'll start when I was,
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.220]   I kind of graduated college pretty listless
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.380]   and I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with my life.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.980]   I kind of had a kind of a generic degree.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.460]   I graduated from the University of Connecticut
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.580]   and I was actually working for my father
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.500]   at his construction company and I really didn't like it.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.860]   It wasn't a good fit and I was unhappy.
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.940]   And I got this, it's gonna sound crazy,
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.380]   but I had this dream effectively that said,
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.900]   "Hey, become a writer."
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.180]   And I started, I made that my focus.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.380]   I was gonna become a writer.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.860]   And I went back and got some schooling at UConn,
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.220]   advanced education around journalism.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.580]   Got enough to get into the world of journalism
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.900]   and started writing for some local newspapers
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.380]   and then a website called Patch that was like a local,
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.380]   I ran a local website, news website.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.820]   And through those roles, I wrote a lot.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.740]   My role, so I paid my first reporting job.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.900]   I got, I think $75 a story.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.740]   And then actually I got laid off from that job.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.740]   And then I had to get another job
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:53.980]   that only paid $50 a story.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.740]   So to make ends meet, I had to write 10 stories a week.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.140]   And that was at only 500 bucks.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.380]   I think I did some tutoring too.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.460]   So I was barely getting by,
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.060]   but I was writing a tremendous amount.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.860]   And then at Patch, it was even more crazy.
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.260]   I would do like upwards of five posts a day.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.020]   So I was writing a tremendous amount.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.580]   And so I was getting, whether I liked it or not,
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.620]   I was becoming a really good writer.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:22.620]   And I did that for the reporting thing for like seven years.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.020]   And then Patch actually went under as a company
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.260]   and we all got laid off.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.540]   And I started working for this really small startup
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.900]   in Mystic, Connecticut that sold a hiring solution.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.340]   And the boss...
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:39.420]   So at first I had like a somewhat complicated,
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.380]   but it was basically like a customer success role.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.460]   I was to analyze some customer success records
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.020]   and make recommendations.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.100]   But anyway, he's like, "Paul, you're a writer.
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.660]   "You should lead our marketing efforts
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.660]   "and write on LinkedIn for us."
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.460]   And at the time, I mean,
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.540]   I really didn't know anything about,
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.380]   I didn't know content marketing was,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.740]   and I knew very little about LinkedIn.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:01.940]   And I was like, "Okay."
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.460]   And I started writing on LinkedIn about like hirings,
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.380]   just things that were interesting to me about hiring,
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.660]   like how Warren Buffett hires,
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.820]   how "Star Wars" is actually a movie about bad recruiting
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.260]   'cause Darth Vader couldn't bring one.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.260]   (Paul laughs)
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.420]   - That's amazing.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.860]   - And all of a sudden,
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.460]   and I should add that my boss at this job
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.500]   in Mystic, Connecticut was very quick to fire.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.300]   And he fired people all the time.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.500]   So there's a lot of pressure on me.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.900]   And I'm like, he's like, "Keep writing."
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:32.740]   And I'm like, "Really?"
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:33.860]   I was so nervous.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.980]   And I just kept writing.
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.740]   And then some of these posts started going viral.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.500]   And all of a sudden, we sat at all,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.340]   and at the bottom,
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.220]   every post had nothing to do with our hiring product.
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.700]   And that was generally about hiring.
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.660]   And I put a little thing at the bottom that says,
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.780]   "We have the world's smartest hiring tool, VoiceGlance.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.300]   "If you're interested, call this number."
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.540]   And we started getting all these phone calls.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.420]   And I was, "Where are these phone calls coming from?"
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.060]   Like, "Well, it's from your LinkedIn post."
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.900]   And I'm looking at the LinkedIn posts.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.340]   And I remember that one of my first ones
[00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.700]   got like 10,000 views.
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.460]   And like, five people called us
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.820]   and wanted to learn more about the product
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.580]   and potentially become customers.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.980]   And I was like, "Wow."
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.780]   And then I started writing more.
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.820]   And then it was like 20,000.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:13.780]   And then it was like 50,000 views.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.260]   And then it was like 100,000 views.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.380]   And then, remember, one was like a million views.
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.740]   And these articles were just so popular.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.660]   And it was crazy.
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.500]   And then LinkedIn actually assigned an editor to me
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.060]   to be like, "Hey, Paul is this great writer.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.300]   "He's writing for us for free, effectively.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.500]   "Let's give him story ideas and he'll write for it."
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.820]   And we were getting so much business
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.540]   from people just reading my articles
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.820]   and then, "Oh, what's Voice Glance?"
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.300]   And then calling or check out the website
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.660]   and filling out a form.
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.500]   And we were getting like,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.700]   it was almost so much business.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.020]   There was like seven of us in the office.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.220]   We couldn't even handle all the leads coming.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.820]   (laughs)
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.540]   And it was crazy. - What a good problem to have.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.180]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.220]   So then I was like,
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.860]   really, I look back on it now
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.060]   and I'm like, all those years of like,
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.740]   really barely getting by.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.980]   And I think my max salary at the patch
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.140]   was maybe $42,000 a year.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.060]   But I was writing a lot.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.500]   And then that writing kind of formed these skills in me
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.100]   that like allowed me to be successful on LinkedIn.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.220]   And then ultimately LinkedIn,
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.900]   I was so popular that somebody at LinkedIn was like,
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.940]   "Why don't we just hire this guy?
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.780]   "He's writing for us.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.980]   "We like his stuff."
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.980]   And they hired me and the rest is history.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:27.180]   I've been here for eight years and I don't wanna leave.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.220]   But so I definitely wasn't intentional about it.
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.580]   I just love to write
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:35.340]   and I think I built up my skills enough where,
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.820]   and then I had the opportunity
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.340]   to be able to build this platform
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.500]   that ultimately led me to getting hired at LinkedIn.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.060]   - Yeah, that's an awesome story.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.060]   So that Darth Vader analogy is hilarious.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.900]   I totally resonate with that.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.620]   Yeah, I think there's one thing you introduced there,
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.420]   which is kind of an interesting idea,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.420]   which is like earlier we talked about
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.540]   knowing the right audience
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.340]   and write something that matters to them
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.420]   that's actual now that solves a pain point
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.700]   they're trying to solve for right now that impacts their job.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.660]   There's also a piece of it,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.580]   which is like whether it's luck
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.380]   or it's even writing by volume, right?
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.300]   And I think people need to realize
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.620]   like five posts a day is a lot of content to be writing
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.140]   and to kind of get,
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.580]   whether it's building up your experience,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.820]   you're kind of honing the craft
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.580]   or just finding the right audience and seeing what sticks.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.260]   There is a part of this, which is the grind.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.220]   Like you just got to put it out, you know?
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.660]   And I'm assuming your career,
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.700]   there's some topics you've written
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.780]   that you're really passionate about it.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.020]   Some of them were maybe not throw away or filler,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.060]   but again, there's gotta be a volume game
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:30.900]   as a part of this, right?
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.860]   'Cause then you got to touch a hit and strike the gold.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.700]   Then you obviously focus on what works.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.780]   But I think until you get there,
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.860]   you kind of had to be okay with being,
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.660]   maybe kind of springing yourself a little broad, right?
[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.780]   - Yeah, I mean, I've become such,
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.660]   so when I first started writing,
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.460]   I'll be honest, like I was not a good writer.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.380]   Like I remember my first few articles for the newspaper.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.660]   I remember one time I had a really harsh editor
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.020]   and he was like, "This is unprincipled, this is."
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.900]   And then another time I wrote like a,
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.580]   in newspaper language, I call it a lead,
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.100]   the opening sentence.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.700]   And then I remember it was my first week at this newspaper.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.300]   I was all excited 'cause I finally got hired.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.620]   I was a freelancer and then I got hired full time.
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.300]   And my first week there, my editor at the time was like,
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.700]   "We need to get better leads.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.020]   "We've had some bad leads recently.
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.700]   "And I think this is the perfect example."
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.340]   And she read out my lead in front of the whole newsroom.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.700]   About how terrible this lead was.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.940]   So I was like, okay.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   So the point is like, to your point, Tim,
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.180]   like I had skills, I had innate skills.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.660]   I was good at what I said before
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.420]   of like being able to boil things down
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.180]   and figuring out what was interesting.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.500]   And I kind of had, I think I have this unique skill
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.900]   to figure out like what people are gonna be interested in.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.100]   But I wasn't like a strong technical writer by any stretch.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.380]   I didn't have, my grammar skills were awful.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.100]   I didn't know how to, I didn't have a great grasp
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.220]   of the English language.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.140]   And it was difficult for me.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.740]   I like had the idea, but I couldn't get it out.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.900]   And only like through years and years of just doing it,
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.460]   did I actually build those skills.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.420]   So point being, there's gonna be like,
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.260]   when you start writing, like it's gonna,
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.140]   you're not gonna be great.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:10.980]   Like it's just reality.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.980]   Nobody's like immediately great at anything.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.820]   - Yeah.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.660]   - Even if you're passionate about it.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.140]   But like, if you do it over time and you're getting,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.180]   the other thing is like, I got, I always got feedback.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.020]   Whether it was just really harsh editors or viewership.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.620]   Like I always got feedback.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.860]   So like, I always kept learning.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.580]   And by the end, I, you know, today,
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.860]   and I still like challenge myself every day.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.060]   Like in no ways do I feel like I've figured it out.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.660]   Every single day I'm like, I can get better.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.660]   We could get more views.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.100]   Like I still put that pressure on myself
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.380]   and I'm still pushing to get better.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.700]   So like, maybe not as extreme.
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.580]   I probably too hard on myself at times,
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.820]   but like, it's good to like,
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.380]   to like, you have to accept the fact
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.620]   that you're going to need to grow into it.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.100]   - Yeah. And that's really actually comforting
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.540]   for someone like me to know, right?
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.540]   'Cause one of the kind of maybe factors I would consider
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.900]   it's sort of skillset that I think I would require
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.900]   to even qualify this is like strong writing skills.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   And like, if I'm not a writer by trade,
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.180]   I shouldn't even bother to be my tone to this.
[00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.940]   I may have a strong opinion on Oxford comma,
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.260]   but that's as far as I go, right?
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.740]   So I was like, I think that's good.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.580]   I think you're right.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.580]   You just kind of got play with it
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.460]   and kind of get yourself some experience under the belt.
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   And that'll help you understand
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.540]   whether you even have a passion to do this or not,
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.900]   but you don't know if you have the passion,
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.300]   if you don't try.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.900]   I got one last question for you, Paul.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.020]   I didn't prep you for this one.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.060]   So I don't know if you have a point of view on this one,
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.660]   but you know, like there's a lot of AI tools
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.660]   out there right now, right?
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.820]   And whether it's chat GPT or whatnot,
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.780]   and I'm glad there's already intelligence
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.740]   around how people can sniff out AI written content.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.860]   Some of that is just pulled from plagiarized content
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.700]   as well.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.260]   Do you, how do you use, or do you use like AI tools
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   to augment your writing
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.660]   and maybe even refining headlines that are engaging?
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.020]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.700]   So first I'll say that you can't see these things
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.620]   as like, oh, I'm against it or anything like that.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.980]   Like you have to accept that, quite frankly, the challenge.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.180]   That AI, I mean, you think about all the writers
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.900]   in the world and there's always gonna be new challenges
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.500]   and you need to figure out how to make it work for you
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.460]   or figure out ways that you can provide value
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.940]   and not be like, oh, nobody should use chat GPT to write
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.780]   or anything like that.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.180]   So I always try to do that,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.180]   is like never see anything as a threat
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.620]   and instead more see it as like,
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.780]   this is just a push for me to get better.
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.340]   Now, as far as like, how do I actually use it?
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.980]   I don't use chat GPT.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.780]   I actually did a post where I interviewed chat GPT.
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.900]   - Oh, fascinating.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.620]   - I will say a little bit,
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.140]   like there are tools that I use though.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.580]   Like I use this tool called a headline analyzer,
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.060]   which I love.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.740]   It's helped me really use better, write better headlines.
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.700]   You can Google it.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.700]   I use SEO tools to like create outlines for me
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.660]   that helped me rank for SEO.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.780]   And we obviously use a lot of analytics
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.100]   to figure out what's resonating and what's not.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.020]   I mean, there's, I like adding tools.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.500]   Like if they're used correctly, they can be stronger.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.380]   So I probably actually could do a better job of that
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.580]   'cause I'm not like always on the,
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.820]   searching for new tools that kind of come to me.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.420]   But so NetNet, like don't see tools as a threat
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.900]   or it's taking your job or anything like that.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.100]   Instead, like the reality is if it's gonna take your job,
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.940]   like you're not adding enough value in your job.
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:35.020]   You need to like figure out like how you can use the tool
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.580]   to become even more valuable.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.820]   And I could probably do a better job of that,
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.460]   but that's something I try to do often.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.780]   - Yeah, I mean, that's a good point.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.980]   I think, yeah, there's definitely fear of AI,
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.300]   especially as it pertains to AI
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.740]   embedded into product and workflows
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.100]   that some people might feel intimidated.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.540]   I totally agree that you can totally leverage it
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   to augment your work.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.540]   So in a way that I used, like ChatGPT, for example,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.740]   my previous job was in the area of research, right?
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.500]   It's like ChatGPT, it's just more efficient
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.100]   than using a broad Google search, right?
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.660]   'Cause hey, look, I'm looking for topics
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.460]   that utilize these specific keywords
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.940]   'cause SEO is a part of the game as well, right?
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.100]   Like you have to have a strong point of view
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.380]   on what keywords you're trying to grow as a business.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.980]   And that can help you at least brainstorm
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.140]   or at least get the process started.
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.660]   There'll be times where I even like wrote a headline
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.460]   that had zero SEO value.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.860]   They were like, "Help me rewrite this using these keywords."
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.100]   And it'll spell some options.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.620]   You never use it right out of the box
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.660]   'cause it's gotta be validated
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.580]   'cause they don't know your business.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.260]   But again, it was good to kind of use it as an ideation tool
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.780]   or I would like write like a 900 word article,
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.620]   let's say, where my team would.
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.860]   I'm not gonna take credit for that.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.860]   My writer would.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.420]   And then they would say, "Help me rewrite this
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.220]   "utilizing these five keywords for SEO."
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.060]   And they'll spit something out.
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.540]   And then again, to your point,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.860]   there's tools to evaluate the efficacy of that.
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.220]   But again, that's an example of just embracing it, right?
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.220]   And just using it as a supplementary tool.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.460]   Well, Paul, I just wanna thank you for this time.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.660]   I really enjoyed this conversation.
[00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.260]   I think you had a really strong points of view
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.780]   on how to be a good content marketer
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.140]   or even how to do the job.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.860]   And so I wanna thank you for your time, man.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.780]   - Yeah, it was awesome.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:12.620]   Anytime.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.700]   - Yeah.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.060]   Do you wanna share maybe your,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.220]   how can people find your posts on LinkedIn?
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.860]   - Sure.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.460]   So you should feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.820]   Paul Patron, who works at LinkedIn.

[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.100]   It is a really good sample of a writing style.

[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.220]   There's a really good content there.

[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.520]   you
