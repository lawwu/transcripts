[00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.520]   Hey, everybody, welcome to another episode of the all in podcast. It's been a crazy couple of weeks
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.840]   here we had the all in summit. And boy, was it amazing our bestie David Freiberg couldn't make
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.720]   it today. He had some personal things he had to attend to. So joining us again, is Brad Gershner.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.560]   Welcome back to the fifth bestie on his Is this your fourth appearance now including the all in
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.680]   summit. I think you've been on four times now. Very good. All right. That's about 5% of the
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.760]   episodes. Nice, nice. I think that's a nice little chip in your in your in your your belt there.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.880]   I mean, unworthy replacement to Freiberg but I do what I nobody can replace Freiberg that is the
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:54.560]   truth. Let your winners ride. Rain man David Sacks. We open source it to the fans and they've
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.400]   just gone crazy. Love you guys. I see you guys next time. Bye.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   Just going around the horn here. Chamath, did you have a favorite moment on stage a
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.640]   favorite moment off stage? What is your general impressions of the all in summit 2022?
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.400]   I thought the people I met were really impressive. I really enjoyed meeting people and
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.320]   learning what they did. I also thought you and your team organized really an
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   incredible event. And I forgot how good you are at these things. But I give you a lot of credit. I
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.480]   really enjoyed participating. The only thing that I was nervous about during that whole thing, which
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.720]   probably limited a little bit of my fun was my mom was coming. She's 81. And so it was not I was not
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.440]   super psyched to really be in the throes of all the parties to be honest, just because I was like,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.240]   I didn't I didn't necessarily want to get COVID. And I didn't want to introduce
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.560]   it to her and got it. Yes, you know, Nat ended up getting really, really sick, but more like a flu
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:10.160]   and a cold. Yeah. But you know, I've been fine. My mom's fine. I know a bunch of folks that came
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.040]   unfortunately tested positive. So that was the only that's the only downside where I would I
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.560]   would have wanted to be a little bit more carefree. But that was the only thing that was that but
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.160]   that's not in anybody's control. So yeah, I think it was second I recall that when I had a Christmas
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   party. Like a week later, he called my Christmas party a super spreader even though I tested
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.840]   everybody at the door every single person was negative at this. So my parents went to this
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.920]   conference, they both got COVID. My aunt who lives in Miami, he was in her 70s. She got COVID.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   Are they okay? By the way? Are they? Yeah, they're most important.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.080]   It's you know, it's Omicron. It was like, you know, it's like bad for two days.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.120]   And then you get better. So they're gonna be fine. Thank God. Yeah, one did and one didn't.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.840]   So my brother's got COVID. And so your brother's got it. Josh and Jamie both got it. And then
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.040]   Josh's wife got it. So she took the Paxlovid. And everybody's great now. But yeah, if you go to my a
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.760]   lot of people who came to the event, it was their first time out like this was for a lot of people,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.960]   I think very emotional and exciting because it was their first venture out. And if you go to Miami,
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.000]   to a conference like
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.640]   you're gonna get
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.440]   COVID, especially if the event organizer doesn't test anybody.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.480]   Impractical to test 850 people, nobody would come like not if you want to make a profit, right?
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920]   Nah, it wouldn't have actually been that expensive. You could put that on the people,
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.000]   they could just, you know, share their results. But I think at this point, you know, even on the
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.760]   planes going out there, nobody's wearing masks. I don't know if you know, well, you guys are
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.840]   flying private. But you know, my flight out there, it was all you know, nobody's wearing
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.920]   masks anymore. But anyway, Jay Cal, I think everybody who went to the conference,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.080]   took the risk upon themselves of COVID. And you know, it's not the end of the world or anything,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.000]   they're all fine. But I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy. My hypocrisy. Yes, exactly. It's like
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.920]   you're like Nancy Pelosi or something where criticizing every time a Republican gets COVID,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.440]   it's their fault. Yes, when you throw a super spreader, and I think AIS now stands for all in
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.720]   super spreader. Yeah, it's not your fault. It was well beyond your control. It was the virus. And in
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.920]   fact, it was probably just Florida. It was just yes, it's the sense of I was gonna bring it up.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.240]   Both of you now have thrown super spreader events. Yes, but in mind, I tested. Yeah. It's not even
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.280]   proven that mine was a super spreader. All right. In all seriousness, did you have a favorite moment
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.680]   on stage or some reflections on the event? I thought the thing was really good, by the way.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   And the only thing I'll say is the Palmer lucky thing was pretty incredible. Which will be we will
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   be releasing the palm. I'm excited to see that. I think that that episode is eye opening. Yeah,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   we don't want to say too much. But I think that you were really I think you handled yourself
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.840]   really well. Thank you for that. Chamath what actually happened? I wasn't there for that
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.960]   portion. I haven't heard anything about a mini summary here of it. I guess I'll give you the
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.560]   outside inversion. He gives what I can only describe as an incredibly
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.240]   motivating breakdown of American defense and what his company and you know, you have to remember to
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.400]   put it in context. This is a 29 year old young man who has now started to multi billion dollar
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.360]   unicorn. So you know this, he's going to be around for a long time doing amazing things.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.920]   But he talks about Andrew, which is his defense company, really impressive. And then the whole,
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.040]   you know, everybody's kind of like rousing and cheering and applauding.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.440]   And then he talks about the whole, you know, everybody's kind of like rousing and cheering and applauding.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.320]   And then he said, you know, I have something else that I want to get off my chest. And I was
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.000]   standing beside Jason, backstage. Jason was looking at the monitor, I was looking at the
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.880]   mirror at myself. But and checking your sweater. And he said, you know, there's a person here that
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.120]   that has been, you know, really hard on me, you know, tried to ruin my life, attack my family,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.120]   and represents, you know, these really this strain of very influential people in Silicon Valley.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.480]   Who have gotten it totally wrong, basically. And he called out cancel culture, and then he
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.800]   called out J Cal. And to Jake's credit, after he was done, Jake was the first one that walked out
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.520]   on stage, shook Palmer's hand. And then we all sat down, we talked to him, and then the two ended up
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.840]   hugging it out at the end. But there were moments that were very heated in the middle of it. The
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.400]   whole thing was incredible to watch. I got to be honest with you. It was super dramatic. Yeah,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.680]   incredible. I would I would say,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.040]   that the most shocking and surprising aspect of the whole thing was that a person as important
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.240]   as Palmer and Lucky felt the need to get revenge on a person as unimportant as Jason.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   That was the part I mentioned when he was like, my career was
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   when he said important people in Silicon Valley, I initially thought, Oh, my God,
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.160]   he's talking about me. What did I say? I was I was thrown by that, too. If I'm being honest,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.600]   he's like my entire career.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.040]   And I had to claw my way back, because Jason Calacanis said this. And I was like,
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.480]   no, actually, I'm looking forward to when you're going to be a great episode. It's
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.360]   going to be coming out next week. Thank you to all the speakers.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.520]   Yeah, I want to give a shout out to
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.920]   Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibbi and Antonio Garcia Martinez for appearing. And you know, we did two
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.520]   different panels. We did one on domestic politics with Glenn and Taibbi. And then the we did a
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.120]   debate on Ukraine, which has now been published between Glenn and Antonio. And particularly,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.760]   I want to thank Antonio, because it did end up being a little bit of a two on one at the end,
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.920]   which wasn't my intention. But I have my own views on it, too. Although I did try to be
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.280]   somewhat restrained and even handed in the moderation. But it's a really good debate,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.400]   we should have had longer, we only had about 30 minutes. But you can see that online right now.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.440]   It actually is a great example of actually how to listen to somebody else having a completely
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.960]   diametrically opposed view and still be respectful. I thought those guys were great to
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.400]   listen to. I think it's a new format, Saxon. I think you know, somebody was like, hey, maybe you
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.920]   and J Cal could do it. I think you and I moderating like two people with different sides. It could be
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.240]   like a really interesting format for us for future events. Brad, did you have a favorite moment on
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.840]   stage? Maybe outside of Elon? Of course, you can mention I would say, you know, maybe both on stage
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.280]   and off stage. You know, I think listen, I think this podcast has taken some shots and probably
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.360]   appropriately so at times for being a bunch of men. You know, I think, you know, I think this
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.680]   is a great moment to be in the room, you know, a little bro culture, and the effort made to build
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   authentic community and diversity into that room. I've been to a lot of conferences, whether it's
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.560]   Claire the alky, you know, Patty Wexler, extraordinary, you know, minds, women,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.360]   all diverse cultures, economic backgrounds, when we walked around the floor, he you know, Indiana,
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.280]   Kentucky, West Virginia, everywhere, right, and who are starting companies,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:23.040]   authentic conversations, and frankly, we're grateful for the community, and the advice that
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.800]   they were being given. These were from big startups to very small startups. And so for me,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.920]   that was a highlight the effort you made, I don't know, almost 40% women, you know,
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.080]   both economic, I thought, as well as you know, geographic diversity. And then, you know,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   listen, I had a moment after Bill and I after Gurley and I got off stage. I was stopped by a group of
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.680]   founders. And they said, Hey, we need your help. I said, What? And they said, We are that company,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:58.640]   you and Bill were just talking about and said was screwed. We raised $100 million last November from
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:06.160]   from Tiger at 100 times ARR, what do we do? Right? And like, like the fact that that you know, that
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.080]   those conversations are going on, of course, they're not screwed. And it's a very interesting
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:17.120]   company. But it led to a real conversation that you don't often have at conferences like that. And so I
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.520]   thought it was much more than just a bunch of talking heads on stage. I thought it was a real
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:27.280]   give and take in, you know, in the crowd afterwards, the parties, the in betweens.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.600]   And so I really enjoyed that. The other big thing that we avoided failing on was
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.160]   putting back the AMAs. I think these AMAs are some of the most interesting parts of that
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.040]   conference. And I think that we should make sure that we probably do an AMA Jason, like, both days,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.720]   we do a two day conference. The AMAs were awesome. Yeah, when the audience is asking us and just to
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.400]   explain to people how we were able to, you know, curate the audience, we asked people, I think it's
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.360]   a good playbook for other people if they want to steal it to, they could, they could pick the price
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.920]   they wanted to pay based on their station in life. And so people said, I want to come up a 500, I'll
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.200]   pay 1000, I'll pay 2500, instead of the 7500 ticket price, which was like 300 people in the audience.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.960]   And we just said, Hey, what do you love about the show? You know, what would coming to the show,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.320]   to the conference mean to you, and we kind of just sorted that and we look for people who are
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.280]   passionate about the show. And then, you know, the thing that stuck out to me, and I know Freeburg
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.760]   had a great time as well, was the passion of the audience and how much they appreciate what we do
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.080]   here every week. And so the love that we got people asking to take selfies, people telling
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:41.280]   us what the show meant to us, you know, and people coming from all different stations in life,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.880]   really, it made it not elitist. But it felt like the people who were there, were all
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.440]   builders. And that was really an interesting part, what I instructed the team to do was anybody who
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.320]   was like a real estate broker, a money manager, a sales executive, a business development person,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.640]   I said, let's not have them there. No offense to those, you know, critical functions, but
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.120]   a lot of people will come to the events to sell and get customers.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   But I said, anybody who's a builder and artists, they're making something in the world, let's give
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.000]   them the priority for these scholarship tickets. So, you know, when you met people, they were all
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.160]   building something interesting in the world. And no press, I think also created a certain
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.480]   vibe there. We didn't have the media there, criticizing every panel and, you know, every
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.760]   speaker. And so it I think it just Yeah, I made it so great. Well, I think it really couldn't do it
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.840]   without all you guys, and Freeburg and the besties and Brad, you were helping behind the scenes. So
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:38.880]   couldn't do without everybody. And my team turned out surprisingly well, I thought. I thought the
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.080]   whole thing was a J Cal grift. And it actually turned out there's been there's there's some
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.720]   grifting going on for sure. I haven't seen an accounting of exactly where all the money went. So
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.040]   it's close. We'll have that accounting any day now, Sachs any day now.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.680]   What could you have done better? What would you change for the next time?
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.480]   You know, I just a great question. You know, we always do a document with lessons learned
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.720]   right after the event. So I went through my team. And I had 26 people for my team.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.400]   21 from launch, and I think five from insight came and, you know, helped staff the event,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:16.640]   a little more time to work on the speakers in the agenda. If we had a little more time,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.360]   I would have teased out of each bestie, you know, maybe five or 10 speakers or topics they wanted
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.400]   and worked backwards. So it's just a little more time to, to experiment with the format.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:32.000]   But I took an experimental approach to it. We did have people who did solo dolo like Ted style talks,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.680]   we then had people come on stage with the besties and do discussions. But having all besties on
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.080]   stage all the time is a little hard for for everybody. I know David likes to focus on maybe
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   a couple of things. Other people like Chamath and I like to be on stage for everything, I think.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.200]   But the format was experimental. And there was a couple of great moments, I think when we
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.040]   overlapped folks, so I think Nate Silver overlap with Keith raboi, you and Bill Gurley together,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.480]   Tim Urban, I'm sorry, overlapped with Keith raboi. Those were magical moments, I think. And so I have
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:10.320]   something in my brain about weaving individual talks and data points with the besties and then
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.600]   having the next speaker on the stage, the next speaker, and I would have liked to have more time
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.480]   to refine that format, I think. Okay,
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.360]   my only question is, was the Palmer lucky deal? Was that a plant? Did you plan that?
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.400]   No, I
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.680]   secretly put that in there.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.840]   I'll tell you the backstory is I you know, I had invited him on this week and starts before
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.200]   all in came out. Many times he said fuck you basically, in so many words, I hate Jake out.
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.280]   And then when all in came out, he's a fan of this show. I think he's particularly a fan of
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.640]   David Sachs is. And I think David knows a lot of the investors, the investor pools,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.400]   I think overlap in a lot of different circles of ours. And,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   I said, Would you like to come to the summit? And I and I basically said to him heartfelt,
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.680]   like, Listen, I think the work you're doing to protect the country. Most people in Silicon Valley
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.520]   don't believe in building weapons systems. But I kind of am with you on this. So we probably have
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.880]   some common ground here. I think the mission of what you're doing is more important than our
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.200]   disagreement from, you know, the Hillary Clinton versus Trump days, maybe we could just, you know,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.600]   put that aside and have you speak. And surprisingly, as people were like, Yes, I didn't know
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.920]   they were doing yes, because he had a plot to dunk on me. But who cares? You know, like, I don't mind
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.320]   being dunked.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.000]   On. If I'm wrong about something, or I'm right. It's the whole spirit of this show is to, you know,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.360]   to learn and grow and have great conversations. So with that, maybe we start the show now.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.800]   Let's do it. All right, let's go. Let me Am I still allowed to do intros? Or is it too triggering?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.760]   Because I do have interest for this week. Do it. Say do it. Okay, I got them. Only if they're nice.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:41.120]   Well, yeah, that's the caveat that I cannot guarantee. But anyway, here we go. Getting
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.240]   ready to gallivant across the Italian countryside. He spent 40k at all in summit on
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.440]   food and wine. He took 400 selfies in three hours. Those sweaters my lord, they reek of power. The
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.240]   dictator himself is back. Chamath Palihapitiya. Welcome back to the show. Thank you, Jason.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.400]   All right, his body looks like he doesn't eat cake. He's got a major stake in snowflake.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.360]   You might have heard him earlier on the week with Bill Gurley.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:11.680]   He's the crossover fund manager with that BD. Our fifth bestie the audience hangs on every
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.160]   word he has to say the dark night of namaste. Welcome back to the program. Brad Gerson.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.680]   I like it.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.880]   What's BDE?
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.600]   If you don't know, then you don't know. You can look that up urban dictionary.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.240]   He's about to turn 50 but he looks like he's 65. After 72 hours in Miami, we're not sure he's still
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.280]   alive. The creep reaper is jealous of the facts under his eyes. His portfolio has been down for
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.520]   35 straight days. No surprise. The Ray man himself is back. David Sachs. Too rough on
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:41.840]   sacks?
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.720]   No, it's okay.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.080]   Is it okay? I felt like I might have gone too rough on sacks. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:54.880]   I guess we start with markets and S&P 500 down 15% year to date Dow down 11% to stocks of note that
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.680]   did particularly well during COVID. Zoom and snowflake reported their earnings this week and
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:08.800]   they beat expectations. Of course, that gives them no reprieve market cap for zoom 31 billion,
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.280]   got almost $6 billion in cash, which was a prescient move to cash up I guess during the
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.960]   boom times. Their stock jumped 18% after the earnings so great for them. Q1 revenue 2023
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.760]   1 billion 12% year over year. They got an 80% gross margin for that business pretty impressive.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.800]   500 million adjusted free cash flow 7000 employees.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:40.240]   They're at almost 500,000 per employee at this point and stock is still down 43% year to date
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   but a little bump here so I guess we might be bumping along the bottoms and just to quickly
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.920]   recap snowflake and get
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.200]   your comments after that snowflake reported their quarterly earnings yesterday. $41 billion market
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:57.760]   cap. They got almost 4 billion in cash. They were down slightly at the taping of this episode today
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.280]   and they're down 67% from the peak of $409 a share in November so they're not in the 85%
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:08.320]   plus club like Coinbase and Peloton. But still they've lost two thirds of their
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.840]   market cap 422 million in revenue 85% year over year beat their expectations.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:25.680]   And gross margin 72% net retention 174% 70% growth within within their existing customers to David
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:34.560]   Sachs his point about why SAS is so great. They got 4000 employees 6300 total customers. So I guess
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.760]   maybe starting with you Brad since you're in this in the thick of it. Thoughts on I know your major
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:45.280]   snowflake early supporter thoughts on what's happening in the market and maybe any indication
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:53.040]   from these two. Let's face it strong results in the bouncing along the bottom I think is how we'd
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.960]   all describe what's happening right now. Well, I think listen, what makes investing hard is
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.920]   sometimes you have to hold simultaneous truth. Right and the reality is there's a lot of cognitive
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.840]   dissonance when you see something down 30 40 50% but it may be still fair value. Right we were
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:14.080]   talking about last October, like make no mistake about it. Just take snowflake as an example. The
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.200]   move from 400 to $420 billion in revenue is a huge step forward. And that's because we're talking about
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.280]   a market that's going to be a little bit more competitive. And that's because we're talking about
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   a market that's going to be a little bit more competitive. And that's because we're talking about
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:15.280]   a market that's going to be a little bit more competitive. And that's because we're talking about
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.480]   to 200 was probably just what I would describe as normalization in a world where rates were going
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.680]   back to two and a half or 3%. Right the market last October had gone too high. We discussed it
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:36.000]   on this pod we discussed it on CNBC. And so I expected a return to what we call the five year
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.240]   average as we discussed at the summit. What's been surprising to me is the negative reflexivity
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.120]   that's kicked in as a result of the war in Ukraine.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.520]   David Collum: Uncertainty about hyperinflation,
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.360]   uncertainty about hyper rates. And so now we're seeing software generally, all risk assets,
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:01.360]   growth assets trading now 30 40 50% below the five year average, right? So I don't think it's helpful
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.800]   to say well, none of that should have happened. No, the reality is normalization meant that all of
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.920]   this stuff was going to be down 20 to 50% because it was way overvalued last fall. We gaslighted
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.040]   ourselves in many respects.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.920]   David Collum: We didn't hedge it perfectly in many respects.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.640]   But that's, you know, that's what happens in late market cycles. So the question is,
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:27.680]   where are we today? And for example, like, why is the NASDAQ up 300 basis points today?
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:33.520]   Right? This it feels like whiplash, I come in one day, and you know, you have market caps up 10%
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:39.440]   one day down 10% the next. And so I think it's really important to help the people listening
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.600]   understand, you know, like what happened this week and what's going on.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.960]   David Collum: It is been,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:52.160]   kind of a pretty mixed bag this week, in fact, of things going down. Shamath, what are you going to
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.720]   take on this of what we're seeing in the market this week, specifically with precipitous drops,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.960]   and then, you know, the bouncing up again?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.280]   Shamath Nani: Look, we, we still had some amount of rate
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:10.400]   uncertainty from the Fed. I think people weren't sure how aggressively they were going to hike.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.880]   But by early this week, it was pretty clear, there's going to be 250%
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.240]   point hikes, one in June, and one in July, and then effectively a pause,
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.880]   because then the Fed funds rate will be at around 2%. And everything from there will probably be
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:34.320]   path and data dependent. Okay, that's effectively what they said. Now, I think the the markets had
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.920]   actually already started to see that writing on the wall. So if you go back to you know,
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.800]   one of our favorite measures, which is the 10 year break, even it's effectively rolled over, which,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.440]   which meant that, you know, which means that from the highs in sort of late April,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.680]   it started to come down, which says that, you know, they were thinking that,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.840]   you know, the inflation was not going to be as bad in the back half of the year.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.240]   And then the second is that corporate credit, which is really what matters in some ways to
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.880]   the Fed, because that's where they can intervene, what is the spread above treasuries that a company
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.720]   can issue debt? When it goes crazy, and it goes up, it means oh, no, the cost of capital,
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.120]   the capital is going up, that's going to be hard for companies to raise money, they may have to lay
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.880]   people off, they may need to get into cost cutting mode, right? That's what goes through everybody's
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:30.160]   mind. But that's also now about 35 and 40 days rolled over, which means that the gap has started
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.560]   to shrink, you know, between the US Treasury price, and what you know, decent corporates can
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:44.640]   can issue debt at. So it looks like we are set up for potentially a decent little rally,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:51.040]   here. The problem is, is it a rally that is sustainable? Or is it a rally that's basically
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.880]   what we call a dead cat bounce or a bear market rally, where, you know, you just get some one or
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.440]   two weeks of relief before the thing spears down again. And we're not going to know although
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.720]   tomorrow on Friday, there's going to be a really important set of inflation data that gets released.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.200]   And I think everybody's going to be sweating these details. So right now we're in a moment of pause.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.840]   And there is the potential
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:20.240]   if this data comes back as reasonably good, which means prices are, you know, not escalating as much
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:27.680]   as we thought inflation is not going to be as bad growth is going to be moderate, that that gives a
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.640]   lot of ammo for the Fed to kind of take their foot off the off the gas here. And in that case,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   markets will go boom, sacks. The interesting note, I think is
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.320]   what we talked about here, everything was correcting except housing. And we were wondering
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:44.480]   when
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:50.480]   this, you know, the increasing rates would hit mortgage rates mortgages way above 5%
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   in the last two weeks, I think it's come down a little bit. But the mortgage rate
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.960]   basically doubled. And then we finally saw it earlier in this week.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:05.600]   What day was it was two days ago. So we're taping this on Thursday. So I think on Tuesday,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:14.400]   new home sales 591,000. They expected 749. And I think the last month before that was 763.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:23.840]   Is that indicative of the raising the rates and slowing down inflation has finally occurred.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.600]   And that went maybe we, the Fed maybe steer too much into the turn? How do you interpret
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.440]   that mass? It was a pretty massive miss in terms of home sales in the estimate?
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.800]   Well, the costs of buying a home are going way up because home loans are now more expensive. So
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.440]   that's going to factor into all sorts of consumer purchases. Anything that's financed can be more
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.920]   expensive. You're also seeing companies starting to slow down spending, really starting to slam on
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.640]   the brakes we see in startup land startups are all slashing costs right now. But that's eventually
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.680]   going to percolate up to big companies to you saw Dara's memo, basically, when he got back from Wall
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.840]   Street memory published that a couple of weeks ago saying we sharpen our pencils, cut everything.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:11.200]   What Wall Street is looking for now is free cash flow. So it seems to me like we're headed into
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.360]   a pretty serious downturn or recession here. Yeah, I think that's a pretty serious downturn. And I'm
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.560]   going to say that we're headed into a recession here. I mean, I've been saying we're in a
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:22.000]   recession for months. The the the tricky thing for the Fed is that they don't have a lot of good
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.080]   options because we have a lot of recession indicators blinking red right now. At the same
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.560]   time, inflation is still high. So they're kind of caught between a rock and a hard place. I think
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:41.120]   what the Fed should have done is in 2020 hindsight is back last summer, we first got that shock CPI
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.280]   print. Remember, it was like 5.1%. And then we got that shock CPI print. And then we got that
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:43.920]   5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   that 5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got that 5.1%. And then we got
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.080]   to come out of the blue, because for years and years, we've been talking about deflation.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:53.600]   Nobody thought inflation was a problem. All of a sudden, we got that 5.1% print. They were in total
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.280]   denial about it. They just dismissed it saying that inflation was transitory. And Yellen said the
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.120]   same thing. And so basically, everyone just ignored the data for six months. And what they
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   should have done was stop QE right then and there, they could have taken a little bit of time to
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.880]   think out, you know, a rate increase strategy. But they were still basically engaging in QE
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.200]   for nine months after that, you know, first inflation warning.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   And if they had stopped QE there, then we wouldn't have had this asset bubble
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.960]   in the second half of last year, that's when it inflated the most. And we could have had
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:38.000]   more of a soft landing. Unfortunately, now, they let the they kept inflating. And really,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.120]   until the end of Q1. And then they let the they kept inflating. And really, until the end of Q1,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.840]   and they've yanked away the punch bowl so violently that I think the real economies
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.960]   can go into recession. So that's where we are right now. I mean, I don't know what the what
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.400]   the right answer is now. Given that we're in this, you know, almost stagflationary position.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.560]   Let's try and answer that, Brad, what is if, if we didn't act soon enough,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.280]   if you agree with Sax's point, pretty hard to disagree with. And we didn't take the
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.040]   medicine a little bit at a time. And now maybe we've overreacted, or maybe it's going to get
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.880]   worse. What is the right thing for us to be doing now? Because all these companies doing hiring
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.440]   freezes layoffs, at the same time that the housing market tanks at the same time crypto tanks at the
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:26.480]   same time the stock market tanks? This feels like a major shock to the system. Is it time to maybe
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:33.520]   reconsider some of these? No, you know, for the Fed to reconsider or just slow and steady wins
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.960]   the race here? What's the best option? First, we should erect statues to Senator Manchin, for
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:45.520]   saving the republic by vetoing stimmy to that would have been bill devastating. That would have
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.960]   been devastating. So we'll revisit that. Listen, the Fed said two really important things this week.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:58.560]   They said number one, our communications have been helpful in shifting market expectations.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.000]   What that means the Fed is the air traffic control.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.880]   They said to the markets at the beginning of the year, you're 90 degrees off runway heading.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.200]   Get your ass back on runway heading. It was a slap in the face to markets, and it was a radical
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:20.720]   adjustment. Now you hear the Fed in these little statements this week, they said, Hey,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.880]   we're well positioned this year to assess the effects of policy firming in the back half. So
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.400]   they're saying, we're going to hit it with 5050. And then we're going to take a look. So now think
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.440]   of it as air traffic control your two degrees to the left your two degrees to the right. They're
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.800]   steering us on runway heading. I don't think the Fed wants to do anything at this moment to lose
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:49.200]   credibility in the inflation fight, we're going to get 50, we're going to get another 50. But
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.040]   they're doing what they want to do, which is keeping markets sufficiently tight, right? They
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.080]   wanted to take the crypto market down. They wanted to take all the excessive risks in the stock
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:07.360]   market down, right? You're absolutely right, the inventory of $350,000 homes spiked from four months
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.520]   to nine months, right used car prices are rolling over the last three months, all the things they
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.760]   needed to do they're doing, right, they need to stay the course. However, the hyperventilation
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.600]   this week by Bill Ackman on Twitter, that the Fed needs to be doing radically more that somehow we
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:32.960]   need to be raising rates to six, seven, 8%. In order to squash inflation, to me seems highly
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.280]   misdirected, and totally out of touch with the fact that on layoffs.com/fairfax, we're going to
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:52.000]   get to the bottom of this. I think we're in a we're in a pretty reasonable place here, the real, the
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.040]   real question is now, what do you need to take the market lower? And this is more of a nuance. But
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.440]   you know, when you look at companies that are now quote unquote, cheap,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.200]   right, let's take an example like you, you know, what we hear a lot about Google
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.880]   or Facebook, right? And people will say, my gosh, this is cheap, because if you run a screen on it,
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:17.520]   it's like 1011 12 times price to earnings. Well, the price, you know, because you can look on the
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.080]   screen. The real question is, are the earnings right? And the thing that can take the market
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:30.960]   lower is if you actually think earnings are modeled incorrectly. Right. So we saw this week
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:37.120]   as well. Snap. I mean, completely just blew themselves 46% down.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.320]   And for day yesterday, I just want to say something about one day,
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.720]   they have the most incredible propensity to self immolate on earnings calls than any other company
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   I've ever seen. There's probably been three times no less than three times over the last four years,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:31:00.560]   where I don't know whether it's just poorly scripted, or not well rehearsed, or the people
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:07.040]   that are helping Evan get ready for these things. But these are disastrous calls. You know, Facebook,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.920]   I've had a couple in its lifetime, but snap consistently, probably once every 18 months,
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:19.360]   we'll do this. Anyways, the thing just completely implodes, the stock implodes by 48%, or something.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.920]   And then it, you know, rolls over to companies like Facebook and Google, who then are off eight
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.600]   or 10%. My point in telling you the story is that if you think Facebook and Google just as an example,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.840]   again, are cheap at 10 times, while you better hope that the earnings are right,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.960]   because the earnings are actually wrong. That's actually
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.880]   27 times and 19 times, you know, I'm making these numbers up to give you the example,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.360]   because the earnings are fundamentally wrong. So that's the risk now that's left in the market,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.400]   in my opinion, that could take it much, much lower is if that, you know, all of this slowdown really
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:57.120]   contracts spend, and the earnings are actually not accurate. The forecasted earnings will need
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.800]   to be revised over the next two or three quarters. And that's where we will probably see the low.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.880]   If however, growth is muted, and the Fed can
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:12.320]   as Brad said, it's a really good analogy now just course correct by degrees, you know, a degree here
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:18.960]   degree there. We've probably consolidated the lows. So said another way, we look at a company
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:26.640]   like Snap, or Google, a lot of their expected value has to do with people's ad spend, we now
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.360]   see less homes being sold. So maybe people in real estate stop spending less on ads, they're a major
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.160]   advertising category, maybe direct to consumer, people are not buying because of supply chain
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.800]   issues. This is a major advertising category. Maybe direct to consumer, people are not buying
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.040]   because of supply chain issues. This is a major advertising category. Maybe direct to consumer,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.240]   people are not buying because of supply chain issues. This is a major advertising category.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.520]   And we're not going to spend on ads. And so all of this ad revenue, that's some of the first to
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:50.560]   come out of people's budgets. So, you know, even as great as snaps results actually look, they were
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.360]   up 38% year over year, they're generating over 100 million in free cash flow,
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.200]   the guide was terrible, because what they said was our E, right, our earnings,
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.720]   right, are not modeled accurately. Right. And so that's the risk that you now have to take to every
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.920]   company, you cannot look at a screen on Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg, look at a price to earnings
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:18.080]   ratio and say, wow, seven times that's so cheap. It may not be seven, you have to do your own work,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.040]   it could actually be much higher than that, because your earnings may be at risk.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.680]   The earnings being at risk is this contagion that we talked about, I don't know, six, maybe
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.520]   we're going on almost a year now, sacks, we talked about a contagion happening, because
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.640]   we've all experienced it in the last two recessions to the dotcom bust in the Great Recession.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   So what are you seeing in terms of at companies, this contagion risk? Are people canceling SaaS
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.160]   contracts on the margins? Obviously, people are doing hiring freezes, obviously, people are laying
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:54.880]   people off? Are people going to start renegotiating salaries? You know, what's the next couple of shoes
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.840]   to drop your sacks? And that would signal to you a true bottom here? Like, have you seen,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.040]   I thought maybe one would be if somebody offered somebody an investment with a two or three times
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.560]   liquidation preference? Have you seen one of those?
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.840]   Yet? Have you seen people say we're going to renegotiate salaries? Because that's when it
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.600]   was really dark, right? The last two times? Yeah, no, it's gonna take time to get to that point. I
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   mean, where you start seeing structure and deal is in deals is when a founder is trying to preserve
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.360]   evaluation they got last year. And that can't really be justified, but they don't want to just
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.680]   take the down round. So you try to preserve the optics last round by building all these
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.400]   preferential terms. We don't like to do deals that way. But you'll start to see them happen
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.480]   later this year, when you know, companies get more and more of these deals.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.840]   More desperate. That's not the first thing that happens, though. I think that that to your point
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.640]   about the talent market, it's definitely going to happen. Has it happened yet? No. What has to
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.200]   happen is first all these open recs get cancelled companies freeze their hiring plans, then
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:57.520]   eventually they do layoffs that's coming. And then the things are here. Both are here. So what's the
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.320]   next in talent wars? Well, yeah, I mean, look, but within the next six months, the talent market
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.400]   is not gonna be as hot. And you know, in the same way that startups aren't
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.120]   getting 10 term sheets, now that maybe they get one or two, if they're a good company,
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.960]   same thing with talent, right? They're not gonna have 10 job offers, they might have one or two.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.840]   And that's gonna create, that's not gonna create the same upward pressure, continuing upward
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:27.280]   pressure for, for increases in comp. To your point about like, will SaaS contracts be cut? I mean,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:35.680]   I think software is pretty sticky. I mean, if it's a good product, will deal cycles get longer? Yes.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.320]   Will there be
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:43.040]   more mortality risk in the startup or SMB customer basis of companies? Yes.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:50.560]   I think one concept that startups may want to wrap their heads around is what I would call deferred
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.840]   mortality risk, meaning that during the last few years during the boom times, the graduation rate
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.880]   from C to series A to series B was very high, perhaps artificially high. So there's a lot of
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:05.760]   companies that got funded in advance to the next round, where in more normal times, they wouldn't
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.240]   have made it.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.040]   Got it.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.960]   Now, if those companies haven't really fixed their issues, they've just deferred
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:18.320]   the mortality. So I think all of us probably in SaaS land need to be modeling out higher logo churn
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:25.840]   for, for customer bases that are skewed towards startups or SMBs. And we don't know what those
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.960]   numbers are going to be yet. But that is likely to happen.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.360]   I think that that's right. I think the other thing is that
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.160]   there, there's a lot of companies that are going to have to get religion on free cash flow conversion.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:44.800]   ASAP. And I just think that most CEOs to be very blunt, are poorly educated and enumerate.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:52.160]   So their level of numeracy to even understand this is pretty poor. And most board directors are
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:52.560]   equally.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:59.440]   Can you unpack it right now? What does it mean to get the business to free cash flow? What does it
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.200]   take? Why is it important? And what are the how do those businesses look differently to spend less?
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:05.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:11.780]   Then you make, okay, hold on, I just want to make sure I got it correct. You make money,
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   but the number of the money you make is higher than the number of the money you spend.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.820]   Got it. Okay. And then there's a delta there, there's some difference between those two numbers.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.900]   And that number is important to some people is what you're saying.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:28.660]   I think increasingly getting that number to be greater than zero is going to be really important.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:35.620]   It, it allows you again, everybody starts to throw out this whole thing, which is, oh, my God,
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:42.100]   you can never slow growth and the company will die. And yeah, maybe in a vacuum that that's true.
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:47.460]   But when every other company is fighting tooth and nail to survive, the only thing that you need to
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:54.180]   do is actually survive by surviving you win. And if you can basically make your cash last as long
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:59.780]   as possible, even if you cut to the bone and stop growing, if you come out the other end,
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:04.820]   and you're the only company that's left, you will win and run over the market, you may have pushed
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.620]   to the right a few years, your plans of world dominance, but they're still available to you.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.260]   It's the company that foolishly thinks that they can continue to spend money at the same rate or in
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:20.340]   the same ways that are going to learn this hard lesson. Because I think that investors
[00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:27.940]   are not going to tolerate being able to, you know, provide incremental capital to organizations
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:34.740]   funds, who are then you know, miss allocating that capital to basically support a poorly marked
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.300]   portfolio. And I think that is going to be the real come to Jesus that actually makes all of this
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.820]   thing come clean, like pension funds, family offices, endowments, all these organizations
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:50.340]   are smart enough to realize that they're giving good money after bad if what those folks are going
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:56.260]   to do is not demand portfolio rehabilitation, and instead are just going to basically keep the marks
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:02.100]   of their old funds because they're just in a in a game of waiting it out. Where the hope taking
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.620]   action, greater than, you know, blind hope and just going, you know, steady doing what you've
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.300]   been doing, you got to make some changes. I mean, look, I love Brad's reaction, I think that
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:18.420]   most growth oriented funds are looking at their portfolios. And they're trying to balance two
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.300]   strategies. Strategy one is get into massive rehabilitation mode. The problem is, most of
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.620]   these people have never built or run a company. So they have no idea how to rehabilitate anything.
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:32.020]   They're, you know, market momentum folks, and in that they were excellent, but in actually
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.820]   helping CEOs build and rebuild a business, I think that they're not as well suited doesn't
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.180]   mean they can't do it, but they're not as well suited. That's Path A. But I think that path is
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:47.380]   very painful. And it requires you to take medicine, the bitter medicine, which is to basically mark
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:53.060]   your portfolio down 50 or 60%. Just like the public market, terminal valuations have gone down.
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.500]   The other alternative is to basically raise enough money
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.940]   to do, for example, unpriced converts into those same companies so that
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:06.900]   you don't have to remark so that the auditors will be allowed to carry these fake valuations,
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:12.420]   you can maybe market down 10 or 15%. But you don't have to market down 50 or 60%. And hope
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:19.860]   the market returns to his previous state. But as we've all talked about, that previous state
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.420]   is probably unreliable, because it was a moment where we had a global pandemic where we took rates
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:31.860]   to zero. And we printed nine or $10 trillion of excess liquidity that inflated these things. So
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:39.460]   I got to think that, you know, prices in 2019 were a little bit ticking up 2020. We're really ticking
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.580]   up 2021 was egregious and 2022 is the come is you know, where it all comes home to roost.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:53.620]   Brad, explain to us, we hear free cash flow, we hear income, net income, EBITDA, we hear all these
[00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:59.140]   terms. Now free cash flow is what everybody is focused on. I believe that seems to be the
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.780]   predominant rallying cross. I believe that seems to be the predominant rallying cross.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.340]   I think that's a great point. And I think it's a great point. I think it's a great point. And I think
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.100]   public market companies now, can you explain to people what the difference between these things
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:11.700]   are? Because people kind of bundle them together? Why would somebody like Dara at Uber, just say,
[00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.940]   Hey, you know, we've been talking about adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA, income, net income, all this stuff.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.220]   But free cash flow is what we want to focus on now? Or is that correct? Yeah,
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:25.940]   you know, and our friend Bill Gurley, rails on this adjusted adjusted. And you know, look to your
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:31.060]   left, look to your right adjusted one more time EBITDA, right? Like in markets like this, what
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.700]   people want to know about is, is that the way that we want to see the market? What people want to know
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:37.620]   or what's the green stuff I can take out of the business and put under my mattress, free cash flow,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:44.500]   distributable free cash flow. And not only that, how much per share? I think the single biggest
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:50.340]   issue growth investors are focused on today is the easy way out for all these companies, they'll tap
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:55.540]   down a little bit on their hiring, they'll tap down on their spend. But out of the back door, they want
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.620]   to give a bunch of free stock to employees to help offset that pain. This is really important to
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:08.020]   understand. Because stock is a real expense, right? When a company goes public, the more shares you
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:14.100]   have, the lower your price. So it is a real expense to everybody, the founders, the employees, the
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:19.780]   investors, right? And so what's what I think the single biggest conversation going on in boardrooms
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:25.940]   in Silicon Valley today is, hey, can we have a little bit more stock this year, whether it's
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.060]   options or whether it's outright RSUs to give to employees because if we don't give it to employees,
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.540]   they tell us, hey, we're going to give you a bunch of free stock. And so we're going to give it to
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:37.860]   they're going to leave this is a real hard truth i had a ceo of an incredible company call me
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:44.020]   and say listen we pay our engineers a million bucks ahead but we give them stock that over
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:50.260]   the last five years has been worth another million dollars each year so they built their lives as
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.460]   though they had two million dollars a year in income they bought a house they bought cars they
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:01.220]   sent their kids to private schools based upon that two million dollars and now when we tell them
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:07.380]   that this upcoming year the mill we're not making whole on that million it can't be when when we win
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:13.300]   you win and when we when we lose you win so the tough conversation is we're not re-upping you
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:18.820]   because the stock's been cut in half and so now that engineer's saying yeah but this year that
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:26.180]   means i'm only getting paid 1.2 million and the answer the tough answer is yes right shared
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:30.900]   sacrifice you should have never assumed that that was going to be worth an incremental million
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.860]   dollars a year but that takes leadership that takes courage that takes a board that knows what
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:41.940]   they're doing to explain that over the full arc of that employment and the first thing the mercenary
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:48.580]   employee says is well i'll just go work somewhere else and the right answer for a good leader is okay
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:54.260]   if that's your approach to this business then you need to go work somewhere else i mean you just did
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.700]   a great test right that's a great filter you you uh you're a mercenary and you know you were with
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.580]   us when we're up but you're not working somewhere else that's a great filter you you're a mercenary
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.540]   you're not with us when we have to take some austerity measures is this the end of entitlement
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.100]   across the board sax i mean we had an entitlement class everybody thought they could raise a vc fund
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.820]   everybody thought they would have 100 irr because they would just buy nfts and flip crypto projects
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:20.740]   that had no released product and the same with employees they just thought i can just keep you
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:26.340]   know raising my salary x amount and now it looks like apple said everybody comes back to work three
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:30.260]   days a week and we don't see a lot of people quitting apple because there may not be another
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:36.340]   option and maybe a lot of the firings that are occurring i'm thinking of cameo here had top three
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:42.580]   of their top like six or seven leaders leave i interpreted that as maybe they had really big comp
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.740]   packages and when they did the layoffs they said you know what the number twos in these positions
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:52.820]   can get the job done for a third of the price maybe that's better for the business so is this
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:58.260]   the end of austerity the end of entitlement i think so or a lot of it there's a great article
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.020]   here uh in well that was that came out recently about netflix where netflix they're finally
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:10.740]   getting real about their kind of entitled their woke entitled employee problem and this is in the
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.860]   new york post but there's many other newspapers that covered it basically it says here netflix
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:20.660]   tells woke workers to quit if they're offended if you find it hard to support our content breath
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:26.580]   netflix may not be the best place for you said the memo so period full stop yeah they're just sick of
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.940]   it they're just not going to put up with it anymore they're sick of being held hostage by
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:35.540]   their employees who think that they can kind of muscle the leaders of the company by starting a
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:40.340]   petition or boycott campaign every time they want to drive the company in a certain direction and so
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:45.300]   i think companies are finally figuring out this is the only way to react to basically being held
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:51.060]   hostage if you don't like it quit if you don't have seven eight job offers you know and recruiters
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:55.540]   calling you constantly because everybody's on the hiring freeze well then maybe people will appreciate
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:01.540]   the contract of i work for you you give me money and then everything else is superfluous on that
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:09.140]   note did anybody see the ricky gervais netflix special yet if not netflix it's on netflix it's
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:16.740]   unbelievable i mean dave chappelle you know in terms of bravery ricky gervais was like i've already
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:25.620]   made my money i'm burning the whole building down i mean he went full equal opportunist and i mean i think
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:32.020]   the trans issue became like 10 or 20 percent of the of his latest special so it does seem like
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.620]   the comedians are saying you know what we're going to make jokes we're going to make jokes about
[00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:39.860]   everybody we're not going to buy into this you can't cancel us we're just going to keep making
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.660]   jokes and we're going to keep making money and and that whole concept that you know people are
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:49.220]   going to be held hostage i think is over independent of what you think of making jokes of
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:55.140]   you know various marginalized or smaller groups of people okay can we please go back to something
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.180]   brad said a while back about how mansion saved the democratic party because i think there's actually
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.980]   an interesting point there yeah yeah such notorious right-wingers as jeff bezos have
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:10.740]   said something very similar lately when uh do you see that where biden tried biden tried to blame
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.380]   billionaires for the inflation and bezos was having none of it he said no listen it's not
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:20.500]   because of us or our companies because you printed too much money and joe biden or he
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:24.660]   said mansion saved you from yourself because it would have been another four trillion of
[00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:30.260]   of spending on top of all the other trillions of spending that we had last year so it's absolutely
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.740]   the case that that if the administration was left just to own devices remember they were touting
[00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:39.700]   back in december they were touting the idea that this four trillion of buildback better spending
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.340]   would somehow be the cure to inflation imagine if they had poured that gasoline onto the fire i mean
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:50.420]   we would go to 20 inflation we might have had a currency uh you know like a serious currency issue
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.780]   no chamath but but i mean hold on but let me just finish the points i don't want to just make a
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.180]   partisan point here i'm going to go to the next question and then we'll get to the next question
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:58.740]   point here i want to there's there's a serious economics point here with or learning i hope our
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.460]   policy makers learn from this which is what happened over the last couple of years we had
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:08.820]   10 trillion dollars of money printing right why did they do that they thought that they could
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:14.500]   stimulate our way out of this covid recession that they had induced with lockdowns in any event the
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.300]   point is they thought they could stimulate economic activity by printing money and maybe cynically
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.700]   politically they thought it'd be good for them in the midterms what actually happened that 10 trillion
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:29.380]   goes into the economy but there's no corresponding increase in the output of goods and services
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:34.900]   so two things happen first price levels rise and we get inflation and second we get an asset bubble
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.420]   in the stock market and then the way both those things sort of come crashing down to earth is the
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:46.020]   fed looks at this inflation and suddenly has to jack up interest rates that pops the asset bubble
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.340]   it vaporizes something like 14 percent of global wealth and then simultaneously
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.220]   workers feel a lot poorer because their wages haven't kept up with inflation
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:58.100]   so this whole idea that you can just print money as a way to create wealth and prosperity
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:03.060]   i hope what we take away from this i think recession that we're going into is that is not
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.180]   a viable strategy the only thing that creates wealth in a society is the output of goods and
[00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:15.780]   services that people want and you just can't try to sort of play games with that by creating phantom
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:21.540]   this sort of phantom money that doesn't represent a real increase in good services or productivity
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.740]   yeah i think that's a good point
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.860]   yeah it's hard for people not to take this all as partisan but if you just look at the objective
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:33.140]   facts the last two administrations have printed money like drunken sellers and it's a mess right
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:38.820]   now so you you can divorce yourself from any conception that this is partisan trump spent a
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:45.540]   ton of money and so did uh biden and who's more qualified than trump and biden elon bezos the
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:50.980]   people who appear on this podcast we have much more of a pulse on what's happening in the actual
[00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.260]   real economy and in entrepreneurship and in the real world and so i think that's a good point
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.540]   i think that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's a
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.500]   good point i think that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's a good point
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:50:00.660]   and i love the fact that now you know bezos is a poster he just doesn't get he doesn't care
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.780]   and i think we're having like an honest discussion now right one of the one of the areas where
[00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:11.060]   i i don't think elon gets enough credit is when he explains macroeconomics i think he actually
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:18.020]   really understands the the what an economy is i mean an economy is basically a trading system
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:22.020]   for the production of goods and services if you were to go this is a point he's made if
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:27.220]   you were to go to a desert island and somebody just gives you a billion dollars when you're
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.460]   sitting there on that island you can't buy anything it doesn't make you wealthier what
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.860]   makes you wealthier is the production of goods and services that people want and that's ultimately
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:41.140]   what an economy is money is just the accounting system the dollars is the accounting system if you
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:44.580]   start printing lots of money all you're doing is debasing the accounting system it doesn't make
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:51.380]   anyone richer and yet you know the way that conversations around economics really take place
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.780]   the only thing you ever hear about is stimulating demand you never really hear anything about
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:00.820]   production and i mean this is an old debate that goes back to the 1980s about you know supply-side
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:07.300]   economics but regardless of what you call it wealth ultimately comes from our capacity to
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.820]   produce goods and services that people want it's a great point chamath all this adds up to companies
[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:20.900]   and the government's balance sheet becoming tighter and more efficient so the talent diffusion across
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.140]   the industry is going to be a huge factor in the development of the economy and the development of
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:26.500]   the industry perhaps everybody being entitled and getting overpaid people not wanting to go to work
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.180]   people who have jobs not wanting to go to the office all of this seems to have
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:37.540]   actually reversed in three months so this medicine we're taking we stopped eating the bad food we
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:42.820]   started working out we're getting better sleep this is going to turn around for the the companies
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.580]   that take the medicine the management teams the capital allocators who do the hard work
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:50.900]   and sharpen their pencils as we've talked about this will all result in a more efficient
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:57.060]   and vibrant economy yes i think for the most part i think there's still going to continue to be
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:01.860]   examples of folks who basically run themselves into a brick wall because they don't want to
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.980]   make the hard decisions that is going to be more exaggerated in silicon valley because
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:13.060]   we have a culture of tolerance and we have an economic business model that supports
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:20.420]   kind of irresponsible decision making and supports poor governance you know look i've said this many
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:27.540]   times but a fund's job ultimately is to make a very important decision about whether they truly
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:35.220]   care about generating massive returns or whether the fee income becomes so meaningful so as to
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:41.300]   drown out every other incentive that they have and i think by and large in silicon valley if you track
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:50.180]   all of the increased frequency and fundraising you can also probably follow those dollars and
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:56.180]   they generally will be the most poorly run they'll be held the least accountable
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:03.940]   and i think those will have the largest negative outcomes and then instead if you follow the
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:11.140]   dollars of the the real practitioners who have discipline they look kind of sheepish and silly
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:15.860]   for years in the middle of a rally but they're the ones that are able to really reset
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:20.900]   and help some of these few companies really win and i think that you're going to go through that
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:27.460]   cycle over the next four or five years and so you know i think it's super well said because
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:33.220]   i have felt at where i've been made to feel silly by some folks who said why are you asking to do
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:37.140]   diligence why do you want to have a board seat why do you want to talk to customers
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:42.180]   why are you asking for month-by-month revenue you made a sub-economic decision like the idea
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.580]   that over the last four or five years you optimized for anything except the market beta
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:51.620]   was kind of dumb you know and it's and and the worst thing that you could have done in that
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:58.500]   period was confuse alpha and beta meaning alpha is what you are able to do because of your discrete
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:06.660]   skill versus anybody else beta is when just the market goes up said differently you could take
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:11.460]   any nba player and put them on a high school basketball team
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:17.620]   and they would be the you know college player of the year any single one okay that's beta
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:26.500]   yeah if you then can be the mvp of the nba that's alpha yeah okay and i think that a lot of folks um
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:34.420]   were made to feel very silly or you know a downer or a wet blanket um in these last few years who
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:41.700]   will probably have the last laugh it's been unbelievable brad to watch the changing of attitudes
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:48.100]   and the entitlement in fundraising and private markets in the last 60 days and it's been even
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:52.820]   more pronounced in the last 30. i literally have people we talked to last month who had
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:59.060]   really crazy expectations they've come down by 50 they wanted 50 now they're at 25. they didn't want
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:03.300]   board seats now they're okay with board seats information rights they were fighting against
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.460]   information rights i don't know why that's a hill to die on now they're like information rights
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.460]   yeah sure here's our cfo's email we need to get money in the doors but they're not going to get
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:16.180]   money in the doors so um i guess what's the silver lining here it does seem to me as a great setup
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:20.900]   right now wait jason let me ask you a question hold on yeah like or to brad like and then you're
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:26.580]   forgetting one other key thing in in the in the race to raise all of this money what did these
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:32.740]   folks do they hired these mid-level kids as partners into their venture firms and gave
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:37.780]   them money to put into companies what do these people know no mentoring i'm not saying it
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:41.220]   disparagingly i'm just like what do they know how do they know how to actually invest in the business
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:46.740]   invest investing is just not you see it you just say okay well i think it sounds cool you know
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:52.100]   there are some of those uh younger folks who are going to turn out to be all-stars in there
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.460]   just like in the nba and they're going to be some that you know prove to be right in the
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:01.060]   beta but let me answer jason's question because you know maybe end on a on a note of uh optimism
[00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:06.500]   you know in some countries you know notably china right now they're doing
[00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:10.980]   a lot to prop up a bunch of companies that should be allowed to fail right one of the
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:16.500]   beautiful things about free market capitalism the creative destruction the cycle time on creative
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:23.620]   destruction in this country has never been faster right make no mistake about it if you took money
[00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:30.660]   at a valuation over a billion dollars okay last year you're not that's not a venture capital bet
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:39.060]   i call it quasi public right you stepped into the bigs and you said i will deliver this plan
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:44.260]   and if you don't deliver the plan there's not going to be a lot of tolerance
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.900]   there's not going to be tolerance for just giving away a bunch of more stock there's not going to be
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:55.620]   tolerance for no course correction right maybe in seed or series a right there's a lot of tolerance
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:01.460]   because you sign up to a lot of unpredictability but the level of tolerance that you'll see out of
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:07.380]   late stage growth investors is going to be akin to what they do with a public company
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:11.220]   that runs them off a cliff you know how that is you've been on those earning calls
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:18.500]   so i think this is going to shine a light on the bifurcation that we really have we call all of
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:25.700]   this venture capital but the truth of the matter is series c and before is venture once you're
[00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:30.980]   stepping into the bigs and taking money at a billion two billions the expectations are different
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:36.660]   your access to capital will be different um the expected course correction will be different
[00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:42.820]   right but i take it as a um i take it as a sign of strength that we're going to work through this
[00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:48.020]   we're going to have you know the the private markets are absolutely going to go through a reset
[00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.460]   but we'll get through it and the winners will win and those who fail to course correct and
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:56.180]   want to fly into the wall will do that and we'll get on with the next generation of incredible
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.500]   entrepreneurs solving big problems the secular curve of technology
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:06.180]   is the only way to get through it and the cycles that overlay that secular curve are not suspended
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:10.900]   we have not suspended wars we have not suspended economic cycles and so we're going to have to get
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.700]   through this one it's happening in record pace actually that's an interesting point i want to
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:21.380]   let me ask about a question about that which is what's the potential here for more of like a v
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:27.140]   shaped recession where to your point the market's correct more rapidly and violently than ever and
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.020]   it's not going to be a recession it's going to be a recession and it's going to be a recession
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:30.900]   and it's going to be a recession and it's going to be a recession and it's going to be a recession
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:38.420]   snap misses a you know issues a new forecast down 40 percent um is there a possibility that
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:43.460]   this thing gets resolved in say six months that's not to say that uh valuation levels
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:48.820]   are ever back to where they were you know in the second half of 2021 but in six months could
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:55.220]   we have sort of done this big reset washed out a lot of the problems and um you know again
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.540]   valuations are not back but the market becomes the the capital markets become unfrozen
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:05.460]   and we're back to a more normal operating environment as opposed to say yeah as opposed
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:11.060]   to say like more of a u where we're kind of bouncing around the bottoms here in this volatile
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:16.820]   state for about 18 months um you know and then it's more like the dot-com crash we come out of it
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:21.700]   in two years i see smart people on both sides of this i hear jason lemkin's been saying i think this
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:29.060]   is kind of short deep sweet six month reset fred wilson just wrote 18 months at least i think sequoia
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:34.660]   two years i mean i think our instinct is 18 months to two years but what do you think the
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:39.700]   possibility is that we could be in a more normal environment in six months right so let's let's
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:44.020]   separate public markets and venture markets because venture markets as you know have a six to
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:49.620]   12 month lag just in terms of the reset but i would say you know the future is a distribution
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.700]   of probable outcomes there's a downside case an upside case in a base case
[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:58.580]   i think the base cases by this fall will have very good evidence right of
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:03.220]   where inflation's rolling over i think it is rolling over what the fed is likely to do the
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:08.900]   upward bound on on interest rates and i think we'll be at a point where we can start underwriting to
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:17.700]   the five-year average again make no mistake about it the s p and the nasdaq today are still 30 above
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:26.340]   where they were in january of 2020 30 above where they were in january 2020 how much better is the
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:26.900]   world today than where it was in the past year and i think we're going to see a lot of growth in the
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.100]   world today than where it was in the past year and i think we're going to see a lot of growth in the
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:33.620]   where it was in january 2020 well i think what the market is saying is that we've grown the
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:40.820]   economy on a nominal basis about 15 percent during that time and earnings have about doubled right
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:44.580]   the earnings margins of those companies are about have about doubled so you would expect
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:50.180]   normal course and trajectory maybe that those companies would be 30 percent more valuable the
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:57.620]   problem is as we look ahead to chamath's point the earnings are likely to come down profit margins are
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:02.580]   being squeezed so i think there's a decent decent argument there's more pain to come in the public
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:08.180]   markets that we haven't seen the bottom however i do think that the fed is taking a good course here
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:13.220]   i don't think that we have runaway inflation i think that um you know we're going to have an
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:19.940]   investable environment come this fall however i think for venture there's a six to a 12-month lag
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:25.780]   to that so i think you got to add it to those six months to really get to the market clearing prices
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:31.620]   for all these companies but i think it's incumbent upon all of us to give really good feedback today
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:37.220]   and i see a lot of it right to entrepreneurs about making that course correction if they're only
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:43.060]   turning the plane 10 degrees when they see lightning dead ahead they're making a huge mistake
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:49.780]   the default action by every founder today should be a 90 degree course correction unless
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:55.300]   they have very good idiosyncratic reason in that business in terms of their output
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:01.700]   in terms of their outperformance to stay the course plan for the worst hope for the best yeah
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:08.260]   and you could even bifurcate the companies in private markets to ones that have strong product
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.900]   market fit and the ones that don't there's a lot of companies to david's point that we're getting
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.620]   series b's without product market fit you know it's one thing to get your series a when you have
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.260]   this like weak product market fit and a great story but when you start seeing series b's
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.820]   happening on momentum it's like that to me is a very good thing to see that's a good thing to see
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.740]   that's a good thing to see that's a good thing to do so i think that's a great thing to do and i think
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:31.460]   that's a great thing to do and i think that to me is is is going to be impossible to resolve that
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.860]   company has to go to zero or has to reset or give even give money back to founders those are really
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:41.220]   the three things i would see as a true bottom like the really dark moment where people have two or
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:45.860]   three liquidation preferences people reset reset comp and tell people listen we're going to cut
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:51.940]   comp 30 across the board for management if you don't like it leave um and then finally people
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.340]   saying you know what we're going to give the 60 cents on the dollar back to investors those are
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.940]   the two down terms you're saying something that i think is also important that's not
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.900]   really talked about which is that there's going to be a lot of really good companies
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:07.620]   with really horrible capital structures really terrible cap tables really bad valuations really
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.420]   big overhangs of preference stock that are going to have to get worked out and
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:18.500]   in getting that worked out going back to what brad said the person that course corrects 90 degrees
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.860]   will win and the reason they'll win may not even because they're being that courageous
[01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:27.860]   they're just being less stupid than everybody else quite honestly because you have to remember
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.980]   in most of these markets over the last four or five years we funded four or five versions of
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:38.980]   every imaginable company right and there's going to be two winners 70 and 30 percent yeah and and
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:43.380]   there's really only going to be one winner and then there's going to be a marginal second kind
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:48.500]   of also ran that captures some value and everybody else is not that valuable and
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:53.380]   you know that's roughly been true but the reason we were able to support that was that every company
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:58.900]   looked kind of interesting anyone with traction um could be you know competed against because the
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.300]   only differentiator at the time was very cheap money that was effectively free and it was flowing
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:09.700]   in you know faster than you could count so all of that has to get sorted out so i just think that
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:15.060]   that those dynamics shouldn't be ignored and so you know again hard work too i mean to the thing
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.460]   we've been saying here it's hard work for a board and founders to do this but what choice do you have
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.900]   well the problem is the problem if you take much more sophisticated markets like the market market
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:28.420]   markets like the debt markets which i would say are much more sophisticated okay cutthroat liquid
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:34.740]   covenants when you see the people that make the money two things are true number one is
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.740]   they're incredibly sharp elbowed and number two is they make money in moments like this
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:43.220]   right if you look at apollo's great returns or blackstone's great returns or cerebras
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:47.460]   you know these folks were the you know they they really were the barbarians at the gates
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.420]   and they made all the money in moments of true dislocation if you apply
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:59.060]   that construct here you know we've never had to go through a period where there are some real terms
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:04.660]   and conditions attached to the incremental dollar um and i think that if that does come to pass in
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:08.660]   silicon valley you're just going to have a reckoning and i think that that what it'll
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.620]   really do is just sort out the winners and the losers and it'll sort out the folks that were
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:19.140]   able to get to default or close to default alive or at least default life support saxon investable
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:25.940]   um i mean sax made a great tweet he basically said it's not default alive or dead
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:32.740]   investable or not and that's an even finer filter well default default alive is fantastic if you can
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.660]   get there basically just means cash flow positive i mean all default alive means is that you're
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.940]   cash flow positive or you're going to be cash flow positive based on the money you have in the
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.980]   you don't need money yeah exactly you don't need money well of course that's the best
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.540]   place to be is you don't need money but i think you know for early stage companies that's
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:51.460]   almost an impossible standard you know it takes time to get to the point of being cash flow
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.660]   positive so therefore i was trying to propose a standard that i thought was more actionable for
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.540]   founders because it was because it wasn't impossible and i call it default investable which
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:06.660]   is here are the metrics that you need at least i can tell you what they are in the sas world you
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.900]   know here's what great metrics look like here's what good metrics look like here's some danger zone
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.700]   metrics and you need you know out of the five key metrics you really need three or four great ones
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:20.980]   and one or two good ones to raise in this environment and no dangerous metrics and if you don't
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.780]   have those you need to give yourself the time to fix the problems in your business to get to those
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:31.860]   metrics um on that note you know sequoia had a really good chart called survival the quickest
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:37.940]   that illustrates this concept of giving yourself time and i threw it in the chat but basically what
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:43.300]   it shows is there's a green line and an orange line the the green line is the company that
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:49.460]   realizes in may of 2022 that we've gone into a very different environment and they slash their
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.500]   burn in half and they're going to have to go back and do it again and they're going to have to go back
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.260]   and do it again and they're going to have to go back and do it again and they basically double
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:56.420]   their runway and then there's the other company that just keeps going along the same path they
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.860]   were at until they realize oh wait a second you know and then you know some point in the future
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   they realize there's been a change they make a small cut they make another small cut and they're
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:11.380]   always behind the eight ball and i've seen this so many times before that the company doesn't make
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:16.100]   cuts until they're forced to and so they never really lengthen their runway and then when they
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.020]   finally do make the cuts they go into a death spiral and die and now they're over the atlantic
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:25.540]   and there's not enough fuel to get to a landing strip and you just plunge into the cold ocean and
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:30.820]   die founders really have to think about the the asymmetry of the risks that they face right which
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:36.500]   is let's say that you cut too much and the environment is better than you think it's
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:40.180]   going to be well you can always hire back i promise you a lower price in all likelihood
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.100]   i promise you you'll be able to hire back okay but on the other hand if you don't cut
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:49.540]   enough and the situation is worse than you think then you just die so you this is why
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:55.300]   andy gross said only the paranoid survive you've got to think about the downside risk and be more
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.540]   skewed towards the bad scenario than sort of the the sort of wishful thinking scenario hey
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:07.620]   david just just one final point here you know because we have all these decks flying around
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:14.180]   now by venture capitalists telling founders to go make these really tough decisions being a little
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:19.060]   self-reflective where were we all six months ago
[01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:24.900]   where were we in october when we were putting more money in and they were hiring like crazy
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:29.620]   where were we in november right i remember some of the conversations that we were having
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:37.940]   but i look i posted in in chat layoffs.fyi right the number one company on that list gets here
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.540]   sequoia company okay are they making a course correction you bet your ass they are they're
[01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:48.340]   laying a 4 500 people 15 of the workforce and they're making a course correction
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:53.380]   the second company on that list lacework an altimeter software company that's doing
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:09:01.940]   terrific growing hundreds of percent laying off 300 people 20 right a 90 degrees turn of the plane
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:07.220]   right that company will never need cash again but it's not just flying toward the lightning
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:12.340]   they're making the tough decisions because that's what leaders do in businesses that are even good
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:17.300]   businesses there are a lot of companies that are businesses that should be on this list but
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:17.860]   they're bumbling along the way they're not they're not making money they're making money they're not
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:23.780]   bumbling along and not making the tough decisions we need venture capitalists that instead of
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:29.460]   you know this being a popularity contest venture capitalists need to look inside as well and say
[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:37.140]   what about our firm didn't didn't work right why weren't we issuing these course corrections and
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:41.700]   telling people to tap the brakes a little bit when we knew markets were overheated last year
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:46.820]   right and so i think this there's a lot of responsibility that sits on both sides of the table
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:53.060]   um but i'm you know there's 714 startups on this list by the time we're done there are going to be
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:58.180]   at least 3 000 startups on that i was about to say at a zero at a zero that's another reason
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:02.100]   i say the fed is getting what it wants right this labor market is
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.820]   you know is cooling down very quickly at least in silicon valley well i mean and the fact that
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:10.820]   people felt like they didn't need to take a job and they could live off credit and there would
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:16.420]   always be jobs for them i think people are going to have to rethink like can i be fun ployed forever
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.140]   and you know do i need to take my career seriously do i need to pay down my debt do i need to have a
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:27.140]   balanced uh balance sheet do i need to my personal balance sheet needs to be in order as well i think
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.740]   that's what individual workers need to think about yeah i mean brad's right that there's certainly
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:38.260]   enough blame to go around in the ecosystem and you know vc's bought into these frothy evaluation
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:44.740]   levels last year um to some degree we were all by by the fed and these low interest rate policies i
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.420]   wrote my post about burn multiple and how to measure capital efficiency two years ago
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:55.220]   um it's getting a lot more retweets now than it did back then but uh but look do vcs have some
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:59.540]   self-reflecting to do definitely but you know i'm seeing a lot of tweets going around basically
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:07.620]   saying like people objecting to this advice on the grounds you'll hear something like if you vcs
[01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:13.220]   wanted us to operate more efficiently then you should have invested more efficiently or if you
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:17.540]   wanted us to be disciplined you should have been more disciplined in your investing and to me
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.140]   that's kind of missing the point it's kind of cutting off your nose to spite your face the
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:26.340]   reason we're giving this advice is because we just want our companies to survive and we've been
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.740]   we don't want a zero we don't want a zero we've been through multiple down cycles and the truth
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:35.620]   of matter is unless you've been in the business world for over 14 years you've never been through
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:42.580]   a down cycle i mean that means that you know no founder under the age of what like 36 has even seen
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:48.420]   a down cycle before they don't know what it can be like when you go into a two-year nuclear
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.220]   probably they probably weren't the pilots at that time anyway so it's more like people who are 40 45
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.980]   have the scar tissue because they were in the pilot seat totally totally so the reason you're
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:02.420]   hearing all these vcs all of a sudden say get more disciplined is is mainly because we've seen this
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:08.740]   movie before and we don't want our companies to run out of money and die i think you can say if
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:12.100]   you could the stock of all of these
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.660]   random peanut gallery ceos tweeting their disdain on twitter if you're right that would be a great
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:24.500]   index index down fixing stuff just write that company to zero yeah just turn your twitter
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:30.100]   out and just sharpen your pencils um i i we we would be remiss if we didn't talk about uh at
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:39.220]   least for this last segment about the tragedy in uvalde uvalde texas uh 80 miles west of san antonio
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.980]   on tuesday 19 elementary kids in twitter and we're gonna talk about that in the next segment but i'm
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:40.980]   gonna end this video here and i'm gonna wrap up this episode and i'll see you in the next one bye bye
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:40.980]   bye bye
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:47.220]   two adults were murdered um how are we gonna talk about this without losing our
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:52.500]   it's really hard i think maybe the roadmap i did give this a lot of thought it was like why
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:57.060]   why is this first segment on the market trundling along on life support for an hour and
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.900]   10 minutes and i think part of it is because none of us can really talk about this without losing
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.860]   our cool it's really hard and but i do think we did good work chamath i i was thinking about the
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.900]   good work we did in the episode of roe v wade and we actually came to a point where we said
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:14.980]   you know here are the extreme positions and then you're like hey wait a second i found this data
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:21.060]   point i found this data point and we actually figured out hey 80 of people want this definition
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.900]   of abortion in the united states so i i'll throw it to you chamath you know we're all outraged
[01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:32.100]   we're all frustrated but maybe we could start there is there a consensus of what could be
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:37.220]   accomplished here that you've come to i've started to think about it a whole bunch but you know
[01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:40.580]   we're all outraged we could all yell and scream here but
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.220]   we're all outraged we could all yell and scream here but a path forward is where my mind goes
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.220]   i'll just tell you what i what i um have been thinking about
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.620]   okay this is just a random stream of consciousness let's do it
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:59.860]   i think that the democrats will not make any progress because
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:09.300]   they try to make this unfortunately uh a moral virtue signaling issue the republicans will not
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.340]   make any progress
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:17.220]   because they become sort of very binary adamant um absolutists about constitutional rights and the
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:23.860]   interpretation of that right in a very specific way um the truth is in the middle you know if you
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:29.860]   go back before we talk about uvalde um peyton jondron who was the kid that shot up a tops
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:35.300]   supermarket in buffalo and killed umpteen you know black shoppers
[01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.300]   he was a black shopper
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:44.980]   lived in a state where there was a red flag law for those that don't understand what red flag
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:48.420]   laws are david you know tweeted some stuff about it as well but
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.100]   essentially it allows a community member or a family member or a school
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:58.900]   teacher or a police officer to essentially put a restraining order around an individual that they
[01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:04.580]   think could cause harm and use that as a way to confiscate their weapons people have talked about
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:10.100]   red flag laws as being possible while he lived in a state the kid was you know put under a psych hold
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:16.740]   you know a year ago and it it all just falls through the cracks now you know ted cruz or
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:21.940]   somebody else said let's spend 10 billion dollars and only have one door into a school and put an
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:28.260]   armed guard there well then you find out that uvalde you know doubled their security spend
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:34.420]   over the last two or three years they actually had a person that may or may not have just kind of like
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:41.060]   stepped to the side or something to let them in the police according to the uh ap showed up and
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:46.100]   stood around for 40 minutes before they were able to actually breach the school you know so much so
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.740]   that the quote in the ap article was that there was a parent that tried to get other parents to
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:58.420]   for 40 minutes they were standing there you know in california you have you know very restrictive
[01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:03.620]   measures um but we've had you know in san bernardino and other places we've had mass shootings
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.400]   here as well because the police are not there to protect the school they're not there to protect the
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.080]   guns can just get transported across state lines and there's there's no real way to stop this
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:16.320]   the nra i find out just so if you guys are interested uh mitt romney took 13.6 million
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:23.360]   dollars from the nra this is the moral finger wagger of the republican side who you know last
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.000]   time i checked is a multi-centi millionaire but somehow still needs to take 13 million dollars
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.320]   from these folks rich burr took 7 million roy blunt 4.5 million tom tillis 4.4 million
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:41.440]   cory gardner 4 million marco rubio 3.3 million there's no effective counter lobby that says
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:48.480]   how about we have a more moderate and restrained pro-gun set of rights and field candidates on the
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.720]   left and the right that could jason find this middle ground and so you know we're in this two
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.920]   or three day period it seems like where folks will get extreme and then nothing will happen
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:03.680]   here's one thing that i think we can all
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:10.720]   agree as well if you look at the underlying family situation of all of these mass shooters
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.640]   there is a really disturbing theme that i think is worth putting out there
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.920]   these are all universally young men 18 19 odd years old
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.240]   they come from broken families this individual salvator ramos
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:32.960]   um father was absent uh again according to the times in the wall street journal article i read
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.360]   mother
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.940]   intermittent drug use issues, lived with the grandmother.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:36.720]   Bullied.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.840]   They're unemployed, barely graduated, if graduated at all
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:41.440]   in high school.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.280]   They harbored these deep resentments towards women or
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:45.940]   minority groups.
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:49.080]   They then project a lot of their frustration.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.600]   They were bullied potentially in high school growing up, and
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.700]   all of the, they were posting all kinds of very challenging
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.280]   content.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.240]   You know, apparently this kid had a one TikTok of where he
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.720]   sat in a car with a dead cat in a paper bag.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.560]   You know, he would post on Instagram of assault rifles, and
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.360]   nothing happens.
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.360]   So I just think that we have to acknowledge that there's a
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:17.340]   complete failure of our politicians.
[01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.380]   And at this point, I think they should all be replaced, writ
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.560]   large, every single one.
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.960]   Nobody has added value to this solution.
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.560]   Nobody has really tried to figure this out.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:32.000]   But then also, like, parents have to do something.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.540]   Incrementally more from the perspective of the community,
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:38.840]   because these kids are going to school with our kids.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.160]   And the red flags are there.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.060]   The red flags are there.
[01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:41.880]   So just one last thing.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.320]   And I said, I said, Brad, I said to my kids, when you interact
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.240]   with your friends, I just want you to understand when you're
