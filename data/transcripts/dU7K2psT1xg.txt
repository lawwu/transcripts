[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   All right, and with that, I think we're ready to jump in.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.060]   I want to start with a deep dive.
[00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.860]   I'm going to call this a world without busyness.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.880]   It is inspired by the holiday break
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.100]   that especially in the American context,
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.540]   most workers get the week between Christmas and New Year's.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.280]   So we have the holiday break just started
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.580]   when you're listening to this podcast.
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.380]   I want to talk about the week before.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.520]   The week before the holiday break,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.260]   that is the week that I'm in right now as I record this.
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.000]   For me, as for a lot of people,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680]   the week before this break is a really nice week of work.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   And the reason is is because it's 40% less busy
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.980]   than a typical work week.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.280]   As people are getting ready for the holidays,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.700]   people aren't starting new initiatives,
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.680]   people aren't scheduling as many meetings.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.000]   This is particularly true in the academic context
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.120]   where I work, the semester is over,
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.320]   and people will wait till the new year
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.320]   to really get things ramped up.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.680]   So it's like an easier week.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.480]   You're still working, but the work doesn't seem as onerous.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.840]   So what I have here, I'm going to switch to the tablet.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.120]   So for those who are watching this on YouTube,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.880]   you're going to see me drawing on the screen here.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.700]   I have a very crudely drawn calendar.
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.020]   Those who are listening, you can imagine this
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.040]   being expertly drafted with beautiful penmanship
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.120]   and straight lines.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.080]   Those who are watching online know that's not the case.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.020]   I have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.320]   just sort of blocked out here on this calendar.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.520]   And what I wanted to do is roughly block out
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.000]   what my week looks like this week.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   And I have three categories here,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.060]   deep work, admin, and appointment.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.160]   So things that are sort of scheduled on the calendar
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.600]   that you have to go and go somewhere else.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.400]   So this week, and I looked at my calendar this morning,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.020]   so this is pretty accurate.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.180]   Most mornings, Monday through Thursday,
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.000]   actually every morning this week, not most, every morning,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.600]   I can just write in the morning.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.480]   So I'm blocking that off for deep work.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.540]   I'm only doing this if you're listening,
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.540]   Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.900]   Friday, we're leaving to go visit my parents.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.980]   So we're not doing any work at all.
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.080]   So we're going to cross that off, no work on Friday.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.900]   So we've got four days, can do deep work every morning,
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.120]   working on, I'm writing.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.140]   All right, most afternoons,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.300]   I'm gonna put Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.160]   plenty of time to do another deep work session.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160]   So I'm blocking that off on my calendar.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.680]   And for me this week, that's gonna be largely,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.460]   I'm working on a particular new proof
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.060]   or computer science paper,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.220]   something I'm working on with some collaborators.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.300]   All right, what about appointments?
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.180]   So these are scheduled things.
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420]   Well, because it's a week before a break,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.260]   it's pretty light.
[00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.220]   It's basically today.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.040]   So I'm blocking off most of Monday.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.500]   And most of my appointments today
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.340]   are what I'm doing right now.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.580]   I'm podcasting, I'm at the studio,
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.420]   I'm podcasting some other things I wanna get done.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.100]   And I'm gonna put a little sliver of deep work
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.940]   'cause I do wanna finish,
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.940]   I told Jesse has a little more writing I wanna do
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.220]   because I had to cut it short this morning.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.780]   All right, and then on most other days,
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.140]   there's a little bit of admin work.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.940]   If I do 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.700]   most of these on Tuesday, on Wednesday and Thursday,
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.180]   that is enough to keep on top of things
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.900]   that are coming via email, things on my calendar,
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.740]   things that need to get done.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.900]   There's still a little details that have to get done.
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.660]   I have a doctoral student who's defending a dissertation
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.100]   pretty soon after the break, for example,
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.460]   there's some paperwork to be filed.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.180]   There's a web designer working on an update to our website.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.340]   I have a couple of things to send her.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.340]   So about 30 to 60 minutes on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.780]   will keep me very much on top of administrative work,
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.900]   email requests, et cetera.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.060]   So here we have a calendar that if you're looking online,
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.100]   you'll see deep work every morning,
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.580]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.100]   is sort of modest admin block.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.820]   And then another deep work session in the afternoon,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.980]   space in between, plenty of breathing room,
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.220]   go for a walk, whatever.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.740]   These days can all end at three or four o'clock.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.100]   Monday is the one day where I have sort of appointments
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.740]   during the day after a morning deep work session,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.780]   I'm not even working on Friday.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.380]   And that's my holiday schedule.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.260]   Now here's the thought experiment I want you to follow.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.540]   What if this was my schedule every week?
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:34.340]   What would happen to my observable productivity
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.580]   if I had more or less a schedule like this every week,
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.500]   two deep work sessions a day,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.820]   30 to 60 minutes admin, one day with appointments,
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.860]   and on a regular basis,
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.140]   maybe an entire day just taken off to do other things.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.540]   I would argue that my visible productivity
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.940]   and the things that people at the scale of years
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.580]   would notice about me, which is books, academic articles,
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.540]   New Yorker articles, and this podcast,
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.380]   the big visible things that define my impact,
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.780]   that productivity would not only be preserved
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.620]   with this schedule,
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.780]   it would almost certainly be increased.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.860]   More articles, books at a faster rate,
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.660]   higher quality probably for this podcast
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660]   just because of the more than enough time
[00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.620]   to work on these things,
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.100]   consistency working on these things,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.860]   and more than enough time for the mind to refract
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.700]   and reconfigure between things,
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.660]   I would probably be more productive.
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.660]   I think a lot of people would have a similar conclusion
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.300]   that if they could take the pre-holiday week schedule
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.060]   and do that every week of the year,
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.340]   their observable important productivity
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.180]   would not diminish.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180]   If anything, it would probably increase.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.060]   Now let's compare this to a normal week.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.700]   Let's grab a week in mid-January.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.460]   What goes wrong with this sort of pre-holiday week schedule
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.300]   I put down here?
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.460]   Well, there's two things that change.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.860]   One, the number of appointments would rapidly increase.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.660]   The idea that I've just consolidated them
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.500]   for the half a day on one day would be unrealistic
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   under my normal scheduling demands.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.180]   So there would be, I would say, three to four,
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.180]   at least three to four other non-trivial appointments
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.300]   scattered throughout these days.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.620]   I would also say these admin blocks would have to double
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.220]   or sometimes triple in length.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.780]   There's just way more things pulling at my attention
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.180]   that I have to do that are time consuming.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.820]   So now maybe I need on average two hours a day of admin.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.500]   So you expand the admin,
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.740]   you throw in a lot more of these appointments,
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.260]   and maybe you can preserve, let's say,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.580]   like the morning deep work session.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.300]   But what you really lose is two things.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.540]   A, a lot of those afternoon deep work sessions go away
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.920]   and the length of your workday increases.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.260]   When I'm in my normal schedule,
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.820]   the only way to actually make that all work
[00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.540]   is I have to also aggressively time block plan
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   just to try to make every piece fit.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.500]   I have to combine that with a weekly plan
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.580]   and a strategic plan to try to make everything fit.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.820]   In this holiday schedule that's on, that I drew on the screen
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.980]   I don't even have to be that on my game,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.360]   productivity speaking.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.940]   It's a pretty simple schedule.
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.500]   I work, take my time, do some admin, go for a breather,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.940]   do a little more work, I'm done.
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.900]   So that's what we lose in a normal schedule.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.820]   A lot less deep work, a lot longer working hours,
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.380]   and just a lot more grinding organizational skill required
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.540]   even to just sort of get through the day, which is draining.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.260]   And what do we gain from that?
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.640]   Less visible productivity in the sense of producing things
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.300]   that the world notices and would assess as being valuable.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.500]   That actually goes down.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.300]   So in some sense, this is my question
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.940]   in this holiday period.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.260]   And this is, I would say, probably the question
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.600]   in knowledge, work, productivity,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.940]   the one that we're not answering,
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.600]   the one that we're ignoring to instead focus on the minutia.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.280]   Well, is Slack more efficient than email?
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.900]   What's our rules around setting up meetings?
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.460]   Are you a bullet journal person or a time block planner?
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.220]   As we look at the particular leaves on the trees,
[00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.380]   we're missing the outline of the whole forest.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.940]   And this is the question that we're not asking,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.660]   but I think we should.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.660]   Why don't we have every week be like the week
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.500]   before the holiday break?
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.440]   What is preventing us from doing it?
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.460]   What would we have to change to make that the standard?
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.220]   And if we did, what are organizations or universities
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.500]   or companies or small entrepreneurial endeavors?
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.700]   Would they fall apart or would they actually become better
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.540]   at what they do?
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.220]   That's the question we should be asking.
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.620]   So I thought I would pose it to you, my audience,
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.460]   because you have a week to actually think about it.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.340]   - Is there a reason why you draw the morning blocks
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.180]   on the bottom?
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.500]   - Yeah, that's an interesting question.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   That matches, I have kind of reversed it, haven't I?
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.100]   - I just didn't know if there was some.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.120]   - Yeah, 'cause in my time block planner, I go down.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.900]   In Google Calendar, time also goes down.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.780]   And yet in my mind, I think this is interesting.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.660]   When I visualize my schedule in my mind,
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.940]   I think about time moving upwards.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.060]   Yeah, so this is, if you're watching this on the YouTube,
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.100]   you'll see an interesting artifact of the way my mind works.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.980]   My mind visualizes schedules as time moving up.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.220]   - Yeah, you're climbing a ladder.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.180]   - You're climbing the ladder,
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.780]   you're piling things on top of each other.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.580]   That's an interesting observation.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.100]   Yeah, so maybe I'll label this.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.540]   All right, for those who are watching,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.860]   I'm gonna add an expository label here.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:27.780]   Let's do, I'll put like 9 a.m. at the bottom
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.580]   and then I'll make the very top here like 4 p.m.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.500]   This is my ideal schedule.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.300]   Now I can't complain because I actually get to do this
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.700]   during the summer every year.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.260]   So I get my taste of this.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.180]   So it's not just the week before.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.860]   For most people, it's like just one or two weeks
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.700]   where this is true.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.620]   I get this all summer, this schedule,
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.060]   and I love this schedule.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.500]   - So in the evenings, you'll like read
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.340]   or like before nine o'clock, you'll read a little bit?
[00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.020]   - Yeah, I mean, it's kids.
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.220]   Well, it's exercise, kids, other stuff, kids.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.380]   - Yeah.
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.540]   - So it's family stuff.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   - Well, people would probably be curious
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.500]   about when you read your five books on that schedule.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.300]   - So typically, if I'm up, I'm reading in the morning,
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.260]   like this morning I was up.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.820]   So I write in the morning, I read in bed.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.780]   And then yeah, we put together,
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.140]   we do reading sessions in the evening.
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.120]   So now if I, usually at least one of my books
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.900]   will be for work, like I need it for a New Yorker article
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.740]   or something like that.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.860]   And because that's work for those, I'll put aside time,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.740]   you know, hey, this is what I'm gonna do in the afternoon.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.580]   - Yeah.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.900]   - I'm gonna put aside an hour here, an hour there.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.960]   - Yeah.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.260]   - We'll see.
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.020]   Did we talk about Thriller December last week?
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:42.860]   We did, right?
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.680]   - Yeah.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.520]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.940]   So hopefully people, this is your week.
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.220]   The week that you're off is the week
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.060]   to really make progress on Thriller December.
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   So hopefully people are going well.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.120]   I'm three thrillers deep now.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.940]   I'm now reading, I added to my list.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.260]   I went back, I aborted from one thriller.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.420]   I'll talk about that when we do our reading roundup
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.260]   next month.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.820]   I was like, okay, I gotta get the bad taste out of my mouth.
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.820]   So I went back and I'm reading Robin Cook's original novel,
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.100]   Coma from 1976, invented the medical.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.580]   He says it invented the medical thriller genre,
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.060]   like him and Crichton might argue about that,
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.340]   but it's really good.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.140]   It's really good.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.820]   They haven't even got to the thrillery parts yet.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.560]   It's like third year med students
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.600]   at Boston Memorial Hospital.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   And there's two cases in a row of young,
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.220]   young, healthy patients going in for surgery
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.820]   and something happens during the surgery
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.500]   and they get brain dead.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.580]   And you're starting to realize,
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.260]   and they get, but so Cook gets into the details
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.500]   of all the science of how anesthesia works.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.460]   And so it's like brings you into the hospital world.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.060]   It's like ER in a book.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.560]   You're starting to realize like there's something
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.080]   going afoul here.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.380]   I think someone's organs are being harvested
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.480]   and it's cool.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.320]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.020]   All right, anyways, Thriller December,
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.780]   we got one more week, read.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.100]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.440]   (upbeat music)
