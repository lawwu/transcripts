[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380]   The following is a conversation with Jay McClelland,
[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.380]   a cognitive scientist at Stanford
[00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.980]   and one of the seminal figures
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.520]   in the history of artificial intelligence
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.300]   and specifically neural networks.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.880]   Having written the parallel distributed processing book
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.540]   with David Rommelhart,
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.820]   who co-authored the back propagation paper
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.660]   with Jeff Hinton.
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.260]   In their collaborations,
[00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.580]   they've paved the way for many of the ideas
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.580]   at the center of the neural network based
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.020]   machine learning revolution of the past 15 years.
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.500]   To support this podcast,
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.820]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.300]   and here is my conversation with Jay McClelland.
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.420]   You are one of the seminal figures
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.340]   in the history of neural networks
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.780]   at the intersection of cognitive psychology
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.660]   and computer science.
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.180]   What to you has over the decades emerged
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.460]   as the most beautiful aspect about neural networks,
[00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.520]   both artificial and biological?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.820]   - The fundamental thing I think about with neural networks
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.860]   is how they allow us to link
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.420]   biology with the mysteries of thought.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.980]   When I was first entering the field myself
[00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.020]   in the late 60s, early 70s,
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580]   cognitive psychology had just become a field.
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.460]   There was a book published in '67
[00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.440]   called Cognitive Psychology.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.100]   And the author said that, you know,
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.060]   the study of the nervous system
[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.540]   was only of peripheral interest.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.140]   It wasn't gonna tell us anything about the mind.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.980]   And I didn't agree with that.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.100]   I always felt, oh, look,
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.860]   I'm a physical being.
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.340]   From dust to dust, you know, ashes to ashes,
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.840]   and somehow I emerged from that.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.980]   - So that's really interesting.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.660]   So there was a sense with cognitive psychology
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.540]   that in understanding the sort of neuronal structure
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.180]   of things, you're not going to be able
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.980]   to understand the mind.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.660]   And then your sense is if we study these neural networks,
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.860]   we might be able to get at least very close
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220]   to understanding the fundamentals of the human mind.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.260]   - Yeah.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.540]   I used to think, or I used to talk about the idea
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.220]   of awakening from the Cartesian dream.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.580]   So Descartes, you know, thought about these things, right?
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.220]   He was walking in the gardens of Versailles one day,
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.660]   and he stepped on a stone, and a statue moved.
[00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620]   And he walked a little further, he stepped on another stone,
[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.860]   and another statue moved.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.280]   And he, like, why did the statue move
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.500]   when I stepped on the stone?
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.860]   And he went and talked to the gardeners,
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.820]   and he found out that they had a hydraulic system
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.620]   that allowed the physical contact with the stone
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.740]   to cause water to flow in various directions,
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.740]   which caused water to flow into the statue
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.840]   and move the statue.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.020]   And he used this as the beginnings of a theory
[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.460]   about how animals act.
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.260]   And he had this notion that these little fibers
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.400]   that people had identified that weren't carrying the blood,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.860]   you know, were these little hydraulic tubes
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.100]   that if you touch something, there would be pressure,
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.660]   and it would send a signal of pressure
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.220]   to the other parts of the system,
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.960]   and that would cause action.
[00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.220]   So he had a mechanistic theory of animal behavior.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.040]   And he thought that the human had this animal body,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.740]   but that some divine something else
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.940]   had to have come down and been placed in him
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.540]   to give him the ability to think, right?
[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.540]   So the physical world includes the body in action,
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.580]   but it doesn't include thought, according to Descartes,
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.500]   right? - Right.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.900]   - And so the study of physiology at that time
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.380]   was the study of sensory systems and motor systems
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.060]   and things that you could directly measure
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.620]   when you stimulated neurons and stuff like that.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.140]   And the study of cognition was something that, you know,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.140]   was tied in with abstract computer algorithms
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.360]   and things like that.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.060]   But when I was an undergraduate,
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.900]   I learned about the physiological mechanisms
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.180]   and so when I'm studying cognitive psychology
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.700]   as a first year PhD student, I'm saying,
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.700]   wait a minute, the whole thing is biological, right?
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.940]   (laughs)
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.580]   - You had that intuition right away.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.820]   That seemed obvious to you.
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.820]   - Isn't that magical, though, that from just
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.180]   the little bit of biology can emerge
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.540]   the full beauty of the human experience?
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.140]   Why is that so obvious to you?
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.220]   - Well, obvious and not obvious at the same time.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.360]   And I think about Darwin in this context, too,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.360]   because Darwin knew very early on that none of the ideas
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.320]   that anybody had ever offered gave him a sense
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   of understanding how evolution could have worked.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.500]   But he wanted to figure out how it could have worked.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.620]   That was his goal.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.540]   And he spent a lot of time working on this idea
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.300]   and reading about things that gave him hints
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.620]   and thinking they were interesting but not knowing why,
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.500]   and drawing more and more pictures of different birds
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.380]   that differ slightly from each other and so on.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.500]   And then he figured it out.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.940]   But after he figured it out, he had nightmares about it.
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.020]   He would dream about the complexity of the eye
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.700]   and the arguments that people had given
[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.140]   about how ridiculous it was to imagine
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.340]   that that could have ever emerged from some sort of
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.100]   unguided process, that it hadn't been the product of design.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.980]   And so he didn't publish for a long time,
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.420]   in part because he was scared of his own ideas.
[00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.120]   He didn't think they could possibly be true.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.960]   But then by the time the 20th century rolls around,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.480]   we all, we understand that,
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.640]   many people understand or believe that evolution produced
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.180]   the entire range of animals that there are.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.160]   And Descartes' idea starts to seem a little wonky
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.240]   after a while, right?
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.560]   Like, well, wait a minute.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.360]   There's the apes and the chimpanzees and the bonobos,
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.460]   and they're pretty smart in some ways.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.040]   Oh, somebody comes up,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.680]   oh, there's a certain part of the brain
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.520]   that's still different.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.720]   They don't, there's no hippocampus in the monkey brain.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.160]   It's only in the human brain.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.240]   Huxley had to do a surgery in front of many, many people
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   in the late 19th century to show to them
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.340]   there's actually a hippocampus in the chimpanzee's brain.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:46.960]   So their continuity of the species is another element
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.640]   that contributes to this sort of idea
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:01.240]   that we are ourselves a total product of nature.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   And that to me is the magic and the mystery,
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920]   how nature could actually give rise to organisms
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:20.120]   that have the capabilities that we have.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   - So it's interesting because even the idea of evolution
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.080]   is hard for me to keep all together in my mind.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.120]   So because we think of a human time scale,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.600]   it's hard to imagine that like the development
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.160]   of the human eye would give me nightmares too,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.200]   because you have to think across many, many,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.920]   many generations.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.280]   And it's very tempting to think about kind of a growth
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.680]   of a complicated object.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.320]   And it's like, how is it possible for that such a thing
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.160]   to be built?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.240]   'Cause also me from a robotics engineering perspective,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.360]   it's very hard to build these systems.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.600]   How can through an undirected process,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.960]   can a complex thing be designed?
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.440]   It seems wrong.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.640]   - Yeah, so that's absolutely right.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.680]   And a slightly different career path
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.600]   that would have been equally interesting to me
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   would have been to actually study the process
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.880]   of embryological development flowing on
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.360]   into brain development and the exquisite sort of
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.320]   laying down of pathways and so on that occurs in the brain.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.760]   And I know the slightest bit about that is not my field,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   but there are fascinating aspects to this process
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:50.400]   that eventually result in the complexity of various brains.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.400]   At least one thing where in the field,
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.680]   I think people have felt for a long time,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.400]   in the study of vision, the continuity between humans
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.000]   and non-human animals has been second nature
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.320]   for a lot longer.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.160]   I had this conversation with somebody
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.960]   who's a vision scientist and he was saying,
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.160]   oh, we don't have any problem with this.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.960]   The monkey's visual system and the human visual system,
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   extremely similar up to certain levels, of course.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.040]   They diverge after a while, but the first,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.600]   the visual pathway from the eye to the brain
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   and the first few layers of cortex or cortical areas,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:47.060]   I guess one would say, are extremely similar.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.360]   - Yeah, so on the cognition side is where the leap
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.240]   seems to happen with humans.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.680]   That it does seem we're kind of special.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.520]   And that's a really interesting question
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.320]   when thinking about alien life
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.120]   or if there's other intelligent alien civilizations
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.040]   out there is how special is this leap?
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.320]   So one special thing seems to be the origin of life itself.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.880]   However you define that, there's a gray area.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   And the other leap, this is very biased perspective
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.760]   of a human, is the origin of intelligence.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.120]   And again, from an engineering perspective,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.440]   it's a difficult question to ask.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.960]   An important one is how difficult does that leap?
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.060]   How special were humans?
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.380]   Did a monolith come down?
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.720]   Did aliens bring down a monolith
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.120]   and some apes had to touch a monolith to get it?
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.640]   - That's a lot like Descartes' idea, right?
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.640]   - Exactly, but it just seems one heck of a leap
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.520]   to get to this level of intelligence.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.540]   - Yeah, and so Chomsky,
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.540]   argued that some genetic fluke occurred 100,000 years ago.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:07.140]   And just happened that some human,
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:12.140]   some hominin predecessor of current humans
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:18.020]   had this one genetic tweak that resulted in language.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.420]   And language then provided this special thing
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.140]   that separates us from all other animals.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:37.940]   I think there's a lot of truth
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.540]   to the value and importance of language,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.020]   but I think it comes along with the evolution
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.820]   of a lot of other related things related to sociality
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.180]   and mutual engagement with others
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.180]   and establishment of, I don't know,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:06.260]   rich mechanisms for organizing
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260]   and understanding of the world,
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.980]   which language then plugs into.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:17.020]   - Right, so language is a tool that allows you
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   to do this kind of collective intelligence.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.540]   And whatever is at the core of the thing
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.780]   that allows for this collective intelligence
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.260]   is the main thing.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.180]   And it's interesting to think about that one fluke,
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.340]   one mutation could lead to the first crack,
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.900]   opening of the door to human intelligence.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.260]   Like all it takes is one.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.540]   Like evolution just kind of opens the door a little bit
[00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.900]   and then time and selection takes care of the rest.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.180]   - You know, there's so many fascinating aspects
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.060]   to these kinds of things.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   So we think of evolution as continuous, right?
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.700]   We think, oh yes, okay, over 500 million years,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.700]   there could have been this relatively continuous changes.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.540]   But that's not what anthropologists,
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.660]   evolutionary biologists found from the fossil record.
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.740]   They found hundreds of years,
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.100]   hundreds of millions of years of stasis.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.100]   And then suddenly a change occurs.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.100]   Well, suddenly on that scale is a million years or something,
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.100]   or even 10 million years.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.940]   But the concept of punctuated equilibrium
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.780]   was a very important concept in evolutionary biology.
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:49.260]   And that also feels somehow right
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:55.220]   about the stages of our mental abilities.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.260]   We seem to have a certain kind of mindset at a certain age.
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.660]   And then at another age,
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.900]   we like look at that four-year-old and say,
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.220]   oh my God, how could they have thought that way?
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.140]   So Piaget was known for this kind of stage theory
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.580]   of child development, right?
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.580]   And you look at it closely
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.180]   and suddenly those stages are so discreet, transitions.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.860]   But the difference between the four-year-old
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.820]   and the seven-year-old is profound.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.300]   And that's another thing that's always interested me
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.220]   is how we, something happens over the course
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.220]   of several years of experience,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.020]   where at some point we reached the point
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.940]   where something like an insight or a transition
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.260]   or a new stage of development occurs.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.100]   And these kinds of things can be understood
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.620]   in complex systems research.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   And so evolutionary biology, developmental biology,
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.820]   cognitive development are all things
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.060]   that have been approached in this kind of way.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   - Yeah, just like you said,
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.660]   I find both fascinating those early years of human life,
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.220]   but also the early minutes, days
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.220]   of the embryonic development to how from embryos
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.300]   you get the brain, that development.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.140]   Again, from the engineering perspective, it's fascinating.
[00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:27.380]   When you deploy the brain to the human world
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.340]   and it gets to explore that world and learn,
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:30.500]   that's fascinating.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.380]   But just like the assembly of the mechanism
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.700]   that is capable of learning, that's amazing.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.660]   The stuff they're doing with brain organoids
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:42.660]   where you can build many brains and study
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.660]   that self-assembly of a mechanism from the DNA material,
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.780]   that's like, what the heck?
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.300]   You have literally biological programs
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.180]   that just generate a system, this mushy thing
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.740]   that's able to be robust and learn
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.660]   in a very unpredictable world
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.340]   and learn seemingly arbitrary things
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.980]   or like a very large number of things
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.140]   that enable survival.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:19.140]   - Yeah, ultimately that is a very important part
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.340]   of the whole process of understanding
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:27.340]   this sort of emergence of mind from brain kind of thing.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.820]   - And the whole thing seems to be pretty continuous.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.580]   So let me step back to neural networks
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.220]   for another brief minute.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.940]   You wrote parallel distributed processing books
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.140]   that explored ideas of neural networks in the 1980s
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.220]   together with a few folks.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.180]   But the books you wrote with David Rommelhart,
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.940]   who is the first author on the back propagation paper
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.460]   with Geoff Hinton.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.460]   So these are just some figures at the time
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.740]   that were thinking about these big ideas.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.380]   What are some memorable moments of discovery
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.580]   and beautiful ideas from those early days?
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:08.460]   - I'm gonna start sort of with my own process
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.340]   in the mid '70s and then into the late '70s
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.900]   when I met Geoff Hinton and he came to San Diego
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.020]   and we were all together.
[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:28.900]   In my time in graduate school,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.260]   as I've already described to you,
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.700]   I had this sort of feeling of,
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.660]   okay, I'm really interested in human cognition,
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.180]   but this disembodied sort of way of thinking about it
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.820]   that I'm getting from the current mode of thought about it
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.380]   isn't working fully for me.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.220]   And when I got my assistant professorship,
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.300]   I went to UCSD and that was in 1974.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.940]   Something amazing had just happened.
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.620]   Dave Rommelhart had written a book together
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.260]   with another man named Don Norman.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.140]   And the book was called "Explorations in Cognition."
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.860]   And it was a series of chapters exploring
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.860]   interesting questions about cognition,
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.580]   but in a completely sort of abstract,
[00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.460]   non-biological kind of way.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.420]   And I'm saying, gee, this is amazing.
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.020]   I'm coming to this community where people can get together
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:33.180]   and feel like they've collectively exploring ideas.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:39.900]   And it was a book that had a lot of, I don't know,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.020]   lightness to it.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:46.020]   And Don Norman, who was the more senior figure
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.820]   at Rommelhart at that time, who led that project,
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:55.100]   always created this spirit of playful exploration of ideas.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.340]   And so I'm like, wow, this is great.
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:03.340]   But I was also still trying to get from the neurons
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:10.460]   to the cognition.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.140]   And I realized at one point,
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.740]   I got this opportunity to go to a conference
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.460]   where I heard a talk by a man named James Anderson,
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   who was an engineer, but by then a professor
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.580]   in a psychology department who had used linear algebra
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.740]   to create neural network models of perception
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.540]   and categorization and memory.
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.180]   And it just blew me out of the water
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   that one could create a model that was simulating neurons,
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:52.940]   not just kind of engaged in a stepwise algorithmic process
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.580]   that was construed abstractly,
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.540]   but it was simulating, remembering, and recalling,
[00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.980]   and recognizing the prior occurrence of a stimulus
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.820]   or something like that.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:13.500]   So for me, this was a bridge between the mind and the brain.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.900]   And I just like, and I remember I was walking
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.500]   across campus one day in 1977,
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:25.020]   and I almost felt like St. Paul on the road to Damascus.
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.980]   I said to myself, you know, if I think about the mind
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.900]   in terms of a neural network,
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.060]   it will help me answer the questions about the mind
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.140]   that I'm trying to answer.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.820]   And that really excited me.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:43.160]   So I think that a lot of people
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.100]   were becoming excited about that.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.160]   And one of those people was Jim Anderson,
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.060]   who I had mentioned.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.980]   Another one was Steve Grossberg,
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.480]   who had been writing about neural networks since the '60s.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.820]   And Jeff Hinton was yet another.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   And his PhD dissertation showed up in an applicant pool
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:11.780]   to a postdoctoral training program
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.300]   that Dave and Don, the two men I mentioned before,
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.400]   Romelhart and Norman, were administering.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.560]   And Romelhart got really excited
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.180]   about Hinton's PhD dissertation.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:30.620]   And so Hinton was one of the first people
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.820]   who came and joined this group of postdoctoral scholars
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:39.500]   that was funded by this wonderful grant that they got.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.980]   Another one who is also well-known
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.740]   in neural network circles is Paul Smolensky.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.060]   He was another one of that group.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.060]   Anyway, Jeff and Jim Anderson
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:59.620]   organized a conference at UCSD where we were.
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:04.620]   And it was called Parallel Models of Associative Memory.
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.460]   And it brought all the people together
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.140]   who had been thinking about these kinds of ideas
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.900]   in 1979 or 1980.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:16.900]   And this began to kind of really resonate
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:23.260]   with some of Romelhart's own thinking,
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.500]   some of his reasons for wanting something
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.660]   other than the kinds of computation
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.180]   he'd been doing so far.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.100]   So let me talk about Romelhart now for a minute,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   okay, with that context.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.460]   - Well, let me also just pause
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.220]   'cause he said so many interesting things
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.740]   before we go to Romelhart.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.060]   So first of all, for people who are not familiar,
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.220]   neural networks are at the core of the machine learning,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.400]   deep learning revolution of today.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.660]   Jeffrey Hinton that we mentioned is one of the figures
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.180]   that were important in the history, like yourself,
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.180]   in the development of these neural networks,
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.260]   artificial neural networks that are then used
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.020]   for the machine learning application.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.420]   Like I mentioned, the back propagation paper
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.120]   is one of the optimization mechanisms
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.980]   by which these networks can learn.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:09.580]   And the word parallel is really interesting.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.140]   So it's almost like synonymous
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.020]   from a computational perspective
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.380]   how you thought at the time about neural networks,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.060]   that it's parallel computation.
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.060]   Would that be fair to say?
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.100]   - Well, yeah, the parallel,
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.620]   the word parallel in this comes from the idea
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.620]   that each neuron is an independent computational unit.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.380]   It gathers data from other neurons,
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.300]   it integrates it in a certain way,
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.920]   and then it produces a result.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.900]   And it's a very simple little computational unit,
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.820]   but it's autonomous in the sense that
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.460]   it does its thing, right?
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.740]   It's in a biological medium where it's getting nutrients
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.600]   and various chemicals from that medium.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:05.260]   But you can think of it as almost like a little computer
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.980]   in and of itself.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.700]   So the idea is that each, our brains have,
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.020]   oh, look, 100 or hundreds,
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.740]   almost a billion of these little neurons, right?
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:24.380]   And they're all capable of doing their work
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.460]   at the same time.
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.900]   So it's like instead of just a single central processor
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.360]   that's engaged in chug, chug, one step after another,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:41.120]   we have a billion of these little computational units
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.540]   working at the same time.
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.460]   - So at the time, that's, I don't know,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:49.160]   maybe you can comment, it seems to me, even still to me,
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.860]   quite a revolutionary way to think about computation
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.140]   relative to the development
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.060]   of theoretical computer science alongside of that,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.420]   where it's very much like sequential computer.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.020]   You're analyzing algorithms
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.940]   that are running on a single computer.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.780]   - That's right.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.440]   - You're saying, wait a minute,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.380]   why don't we take a really dumb, very simple computer
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   and just have a lot of them interconnected together?
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.580]   And they're all operating in their own little world
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.560]   and they're communicating with each other.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.940]   And thinking of computation in that way,
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.440]   and from that kind of computation,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.580]   trying to understand how things like certain characteristics
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.780]   of the human mind can emerge.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.620]   - Right.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.020]   - That's quite a revolutionary way of thinking, I would say.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:37.500]   - Well, yes, I agree with you.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   And there's still this sort of sense of,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   not sort of knowing how we kind of get all the way there,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.420]   I think, and this very much remains
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.000]   at the core of the questions that everybody's asking
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.860]   about the capabilities of deep learning
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.840]   and all these kinds of things.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.460]   But if I could just play this out a little bit,
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:11.060]   a convolutional neural network or a CNN,
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.380]   which many people may have heard of,
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.380]   is a set of, you could think of it biologically
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:26.400]   as a set of collections of neurons.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   Each one had, each collection has maybe 10,000 neurons in it
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.760]   but there's many layers, right?
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.740]   Some of these things are hundreds
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.040]   or even a thousand layers deep,
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.680]   but others are closer to the biological brain
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.520]   and maybe they're like 20 layers deep
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.960]   or something like that.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.600]   So we have, within each layer,
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   we have thousands of neurons or tens of thousands maybe.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   Well, in the brain, we probably have millions in each layer,
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.780]   but we're getting sort of similar in a certain way, right?
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:09.240]   And then we think, okay, at the bottom level,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.600]   there's an array of things
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.320]   that are like the photoreceptors in the eye.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.600]   They respond to the amount of light of a certain wavelength
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.160]   at a certain location on the pixel array.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.600]   So that's like the biological eye.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.280]   And then there's several further stages going up,
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.620]   layers of these neuron-like units.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:35.540]   And you go from that raw input,
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.280]   array of pixels to a classification,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.920]   you've actually built a system
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.160]   that could do the same kind of thing
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.000]   that you and I do when we open our eyes
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.980]   and we look around and we see there's a cup,
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.000]   there's a cell phone, there's a water bottle.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.960]   And these systems are doing that now, right?
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   So they are, in terms of the parallel idea
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.240]   that we were talking about before,
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.560]   they are doing this massively parallel computation
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.560]   in the sense that each of the neurons
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.320]   in each of those layers is thought of as computing
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   its little bit of something about the input
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.860]   simultaneously with all the other ones in the same layer.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.100]   We get to the point of abstracting that away
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.880]   and thinking, oh, it's just one whole vector
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.200]   that's being computed,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.040]   one activation pattern that's computed in a single step.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:36.200]   And that abstraction is useful,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   but it's still that parallel and distributed processing.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   Each one of these guys is just contributing
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.120]   a tiny bit to that whole thing.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.760]   - And that's the excitement that you felt
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.320]   that from these simple things,
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.000]   you can emerge when you add these level
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.880]   of abstractions on it.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.040]   You can start getting all the beautiful things
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.240]   that we think about as cognition.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.200]   And so, okay, so you have this conference,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.280]   I forgot the name already,
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.440]   but it's Parallel and Something Associative Memory
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.700]   and so on, very exciting, technical and exciting title.
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.720]   And you started talking about Dave Romerhart.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.160]   So who is this person that was so,
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.280]   you've spoken very highly of him.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.780]   Can you tell me about him, his ideas, his mind,
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.960]   who he was as a human being, as a scientist?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.480]   - So Dave came from a little tiny town
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.820]   in Western South Dakota.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.920]   And his mother was the librarian
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.580]   and his father was the editor of the newspaper.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.060]   And I know one of his brothers pretty well.
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:49.600]   They grew up, there were four brothers
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.720]   and they grew up together
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.580]   and their father encouraged them
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.280]   to compete with each other a lot.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:02.500]   They competed in sports and they competed in mind games.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.960]   I don't know, things like Sudoku and chess
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.880]   and various things like that.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   And Dave was a standout undergraduate.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:21.440]   He went at a younger age than most people do to college
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.960]   at the University of South Dakota and majored in mathematics.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   And I don't know how he got interested in psychology
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.520]   but he applied to the mathematical psychology program
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.800]   at Stanford and was accepted as a PhD student
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.400]   to study mathematical psychology at Stanford.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   So mathematical psychology is the use of mathematics
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.680]   to model mental processes.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   - So something that I think these days
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.320]   might be called cognitive modeling,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.360]   that whole space.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.480]   - Yeah, it's mathematical in the sense that
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:05.560]   you say if this is true and that is true
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.240]   then I can derive that this should follow.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.320]   And so you say these are my stipulations
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.080]   about the fundamental principles
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.160]   and this is my prediction about behavior
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.800]   and it's all done with equations.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.860]   It's not done with a computer simulation.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.240]   So you solve the equation and that tells you
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.440]   what the probability that the subject will be correct
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.360]   on the seventh trial of the experiment is
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.560]   or something like that.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   So it's a use of mathematics to descriptively characterize
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.000]   aspects of behavior.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.880]   And Stanford at that time was the place where
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.720]   there were several really, really strong
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.120]   mathematical thinkers who were also connected
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.600]   with three or four others around the country
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   who brought a lot of really exciting ideas onto the table.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.860]   And it was a very, very prestigious part
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.020]   of the field of psychology at that time.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.200]   So Rumelhart comes into this.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.420]   He was a very strong student within that program.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:18.400]   And he got this job at this brand new university
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.080]   in San Diego in 1967 where he's one of the first
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:29.020]   assistant professors in the Department of Psychology at UCSD.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:35.200]   So I got there in '74, seven years later
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:42.440]   and Rumelhart at that time was still doing
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   mathematical modeling, but he had gotten interested
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:55.520]   in cognition, he'd gotten interested in understanding
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.520]   and understanding I think remains,
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:06.560]   what does it mean to understand anyway?
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.080]   It's an interesting sort of curious,
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.240]   like how would we know if we really understood something?
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.800]   But he was interested in building machines
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.580]   that would hear a couple of sentences
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:23.640]   and have an insight about what was going on.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.200]   So for example, one of his favorite things at that time was,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.840]   Margie was sitting on the front step
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.080]   when she heard the familiar jingle of the good humor man.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.120]   She remembered her birthday money and ran into the house.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.540]   What is Margie doing?
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.680]   Why?
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.200]   Well, there's a couple of ideas you could have,
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.240]   but the most natural one is that the good humor man
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.600]   brings ice cream, she likes ice cream,
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.160]   she knows she needs money to buy ice cream
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.120]   so she's gonna run into the house and get her money
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.960]   so she can buy herself an ice cream.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.160]   It's a huge amount of inference that has to happen
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.560]   to get those things to link up with each other.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.160]   And he was interested in how the hell that could happen.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   And he was trying to build good old-fashioned AI style
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:25.000]   models of representation of language
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and content of things like has money.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.480]   - So like formal logic and knowledge basis,
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.840]   like that kind of stuff.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.880]   So he was integrating that with his thinking
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.640]   about cognition.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.920]   The mechanisms cognition,
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.800]   how can they mechanistically be applied
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.400]   to build these knowledge,
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.480]   to actually build something that looks like a web
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.040]   of knowledge and thereby from there emerges
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.800]   something like understanding, whatever the heck that is.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.980]   - Yeah, he was grappling, this was something
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:03.360]   that they grappled with at the end of that book
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.520]   that I was describing, Explorations in Cognition.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.320]   But he was realizing that the paradigm
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.720]   of good old-fashioned AI wasn't giving him
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.320]   the answers to these questions.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.840]   - By the way, that's called good old-fashioned AI now.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.680]   It wasn't called that at the time.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.520]   - Well, it was.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.640]   It was beginning to be called that.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.880]   - Oh, 'cause it was from the '60s.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.760]   - Yeah, yeah, by the late '70s,
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.080]   it was kind of old-fashioned
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.680]   and it hadn't really panned out.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   People were beginning to recognize that.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.120]   And Rumelhart was like, yeah, he was part
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.640]   of the recognition that this wasn't all working.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   Anyway, so he started thinking in terms of the idea
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:51.480]   that we needed systems that allowed us
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.280]   to integrate multiple simultaneous constraints
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   in a way that would be mutually influencing each other.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So he wrote a paper that just really,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.600]   first time I read it, I thought, oh, well, yeah,
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.960]   but is this important?
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.240]   But after a while, it just got under my skin.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.280]   And it was called an Interactive Model of Reading.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.680]   And in this paper, he laid out the idea
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.680]   that every aspect of our brain's ability
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.520]   to read, our interpretation of what's coming off the page
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:40.960]   when we read, at every level of analysis you can think of
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.920]   actually depends on all the other levels of analysis.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.920]   So what are the actual pixels making up each letter?
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And what do those pixels signify about which letters
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.040]   they are, and what do those letters tell us
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.640]   about what words are there?
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.000]   And what do those words tell us about what ideas
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.560]   the author is trying to convey?
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   And so he had this model where we have these little tiny
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.560]   elements that represent each of the pixels
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:30.320]   of each of the letters, and then other ones
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.160]   that represent the line segments in them,
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.920]   and other ones that represent the letters,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.440]   and other ones that represent the words.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:41.440]   And at that time, his idea was there's this set of experts.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.660]   There's an expert about how to construct a line
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.700]   out of pixels, and another expert about how,
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.280]   which sets of lines go together to make which letters,
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.340]   and another one about which letters go together
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.780]   to make which words, and another one about
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.580]   what the meanings of the words are,
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.860]   and another one about how the meanings fit together,
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.180]   and things like that.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.220]   And all these experts are looking at this data,
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:11.220]   and they're updating hypotheses at other levels.
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.580]   So the word expert can tell the letter expert,
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.260]   oh, I think there should be a T there,
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.580]   because I think there should be a word the here,
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.620]   and the bottom-up sort of feature-to-letter expert
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.540]   can say, I think there should be a T there too,
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.700]   and if they agree, then you see a T, right?
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.600]   And so there's a top-down, bottom-up, interactive process,
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.860]   but it's going on at all layers simultaneously.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.180]   So everything can filter all the way down from the top,
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.900]   as well as all the way up from the bottom,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:42.700]   and it's a completely interactive, bidirectional,
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.180]   parallel, distributed process.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.740]   - That is somehow, because of the abstractions,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.460]   it's hierarchical, so there's different layers
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.700]   of responsibilities, different levels of responsibilities.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.620]   First of all, it's fascinating to think about it
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.440]   in this kind of mechanistic way.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.140]   So not thinking purely from the structure
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.980]   of a neural network, or something like a neural network,
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.860]   but thinking about these little guys
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.860]   that work on letters, and then the letters become words,
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.620]   and words become sentences,
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.780]   and that's a very interesting hypothesis,
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.400]   that from that kind of hierarchical structure
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.580]   can emerge understanding.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.260]   - Yeah, but the thing is, though,
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.700]   I wanna just sort of relate this
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.700]   to the earlier part of the conversation.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:31.220]   When Romalhart was first thinking about it,
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.620]   there were these experts on the side,
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.860]   one for the features, and one for the letters,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.900]   and one for how the letters make the words, and so on,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:43.060]   and they would each be working,
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:47.020]   sort of evaluating various propositions about,
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.980]   is this combination of features here
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.020]   going to be one that looks like the letter T, and so on?
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.700]   And what he realized,
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.400]   kind of after reading Hinton's dissertation,
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   and hearing about Jim Anderson's linear algebra book,
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.120]   algebra-based neural network models
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.680]   that I was telling you about before,
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.840]   was that he could replace those experts
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.720]   with neuron-like processing units,
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.760]   which just would have their connection weights
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.040]   that would do this job.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.400]   So what ended up happening was
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.320]   that Romalhart and I got together,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.160]   and we created a model
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.240]   called the Interactive Activation Model of Letter Perception,
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:34.080]   which takes these little pixel-level,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   inputs, constructs line segment features,
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.860]   letters, and words,
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:45.000]   but now we built it out of a set of neuron-like
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.360]   processing units that are just connected to each other
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.560]   with connection weights.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.220]   So the unit for the word time
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.080]   has a connection to the unit for the letter T
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.200]   in the first position,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.920]   and the letter I in the second position, so on,
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:03.720]   and because these connections are bidirectional,
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.800]   if you have prior knowledge that it might be the word time,
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:12.000]   that starts to prime the letters and the features,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.960]   and if you don't, then it has to start bottom-up,
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.360]   but the directionality just depends
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.160]   on where the information comes in first,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.080]   and if you have context together
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.240]   with features at the same time,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.720]   they can convergently result in an emergent perception,
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.720]   and that was the piece of work that we did together
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:40.760]   that sort of got us both completely convinced
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:44.560]   that this neural network way of thinking
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:48.460]   was going to be able to actually address the questions
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.800]   that we were interested in as cognitive psychologists.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.160]   - So the algorithmic side, the optimization side,
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.800]   those are all details, like when you first start,
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.560]   the idea that you can get far
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.400]   with this kind of way of thinking,
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.440]   that in itself is a profound idea.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.040]   So do you like the term connectionism
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.760]   to describe this kind of set of ideas?
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.860]   - I think it's useful.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:15.120]   It highlights the notion that the knowledge
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.320]   that the system exploits
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.360]   is in the connections between the units, right?
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.780]   There isn't a separate dictionary.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.000]   There's just the connections between the units.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   So I already sort of laid that on the table
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.160]   with the connections from the letter units
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.920]   to the unit for the word time, right?
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.040]   The unit for the word time isn't a unit for the word time
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.220]   for any other reason than it's got the connections
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.040]   to the letters that make up the word time.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.360]   Those are the units on the input that excite it
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.680]   when it's excited that it in a sense represents
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   in the system that there's support for the hypothesis
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.120]   that the word time is present in the input.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   But it's not,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.360]   the word time isn't written anywhere inside the model.
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.780]   It's only written there in the picture we drew of the model
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.920]   to say that's the unit for the word time, right?
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.640]   And if somebody wants to tell me,
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.080]   well, how do you spell that word?
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.320]   You have to use the connections from that out
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.800]   to then get those letters, for example.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.600]   - That's such a, that's a counterintuitive idea.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.020]   We humans want to think in this logic way.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:41.240]   This idea of connectionism, it doesn't, it's weird.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.520]   It's weird that this is how it all works.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.120]   - Yeah, but let's go back to that CNN, right?
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.200]   That CNN with all those layers of neuron-like processing
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.520]   units that we were talking about before,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.400]   it's gonna come out and say, this is a cat, that's a dog.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:57.720]   But it has no idea why it said that.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.440]   It's just got all these connections
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.040]   between all these layers of neurons,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:05.200]   like from the very first layer to the, you know,
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.880]   like whatever these layers are,
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.520]   they just get numbered after a while because they,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.640]   you know, they somehow further in you go,
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.200]   the more abstract the features are,
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.320]   but it's a graded and continuous sort of process
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.640]   of abstraction anyway.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.440]   And, you know, it goes from very local,
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.880]   very, very specific to much more sort of global,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.000]   but it's still, you know, another sort of pattern
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.980]   of activation over an array of units.
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.360]   And then at the output side, it says it's cat or it's a dog.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   And when we, when I open my eyes and say, oh, that's Lex,
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   or, oh, you know, there's my own dog.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.280]   And I recognize my dog,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.080]   which is a member of the same species as many other dogs,
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.880]   but I know this one because of some
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.440]   slightly unique characteristics.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.420]   I don't know how to describe what it is that makes me know
[00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:04.680]   that I'm looking at Lex or at my particular dog, right?
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.680]   Or even that I'm looking at a particular brand of car.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.420]   Like I could say a few words about it,
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.480]   but if I wrote you a paragraph about the car,
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.200]   you would have trouble figuring out
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.760]   which car is he talking about, right?
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.400]   So the idea that we have propositional knowledge
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:23.360]   of what it is that allows us to recognize
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.300]   that this is an actual instance
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.760]   of this particular natural kind
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.360]   has always been, you know, something that,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.560]   it never worked, right?
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.920]   You couldn't ever write down a set of propositions
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.540]   for, you know, visual recognition.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.380]   And so in that space,
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.260]   it sort of always seemed very natural
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:51.260]   that something more implicit, you know,
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:54.080]   you don't have access to what the details
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.520]   of the computation were in between,
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.360]   you just get the result.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.140]   So that's the other part of connectionism.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.060]   You cannot, you don't read the contents of the connections.
[00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:09.060]   The connections only cause outputs to occur based on inputs.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:13.720]   - Yeah, and for us that like final layer
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.560]   or some particular layer is very important.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.480]   The one that tells us that it's our dog
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.200]   or like it's a cat or a dog.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.440]   But, you know, each layer is probably equally as important
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.280]   in the grand scheme of things.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.240]   Like there's no reason why the cat versus dog
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.120]   is more important than the lower level activations.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.100]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.820]   I mean, all of it is just this beautiful stacking
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.660]   on top of each other.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.740]   And we humans live in this particular layers for us.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.400]   For us, it's useful to survive,
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.860]   to use those cat versus dog, predator versus prey,
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.180]   all those kinds of things.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.260]   It's fascinating that it's all continuous.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.700]   But then you then ask, you know,
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.300]   the history of artificial intelligence,
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   you ask, are we able to introspect and convert
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.740]   the very things that allow us to tell the difference
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.380]   between cat and dog into logic, into formal logic.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.620]   That's been the dream.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.460]   I would say that's still part of the dream of symbolic AI.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:15.460]   And I've recently talked to Doug Lennard who created Psych.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:23.180]   And that's a project that lasted for many decades
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.820]   and still carries a sort of dream in it, right?
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.700]   - And we still don't know the answer, right?
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.820]   It seems like connectionism is really powerful,
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.740]   but it also seems like there's this building of knowledge.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.420]   And so how do we, how do you square those two?
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:44.180]   Like, do you think the connections can contain
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.940]   the depth of human knowledge and the depth
[00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.500]   of what Dave Romahart was thinking about of understanding?
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.900]   - Well, that remains the $64 question.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.700]   - With inflation, that number is higher.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.820]   - Okay, $64,000.
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.660]   Maybe it's the $64 billion question now.
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:13.820]   You know, I think that from the emergentist side,
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:22.440]   which, you know, I place myself on.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.980]   So I used to sometimes tell people
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.620]   I was a radical eliminative connectionist
[00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:34.380]   because I didn't want them to think
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:38.280]   that I wanted to build like anything into the machine.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:44.420]   But I don't like the word eliminative anymore
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:50.580]   because it makes it seem like it's wrong to think
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.860]   that there is this emergent level of understanding.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:00.100]   And I disagree with that.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.260]   So I think, you know, I would call myself
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.900]   in a radical emergentist connectionist
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.460]   rather than eliminative connectionist, right?
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.460]   Because I want to acknowledge that these higher level
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:19.380]   kinds of aspects of our cognition are real,
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.420]   but they're not, they don't,
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.980]   they don't exist as such.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:33.540]   And there was an example that Doug Hofstadter used to use
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:36.660]   that I thought was helpful in this respect.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:41.300]   Just the idea that we can think about sand dunes
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:47.940]   as entities and talk about like how many there are even,
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.380]   but we also know that a sand dune is a very fluid thing.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:01.380]   It's a pile of sand that is capable of moving around
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.380]   under the wind and, you know,
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.100]   reforming itself in somewhat different ways.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.000]   And if we think about our thoughts as like sand dunes,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.100]   as being things that, you know, emerge from
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.260]   just the way all the lower level elements
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:24.380]   sort of work together and are constrained
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.140]   by external forces, then we can say,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:33.140]   yes, they exist as such, but they also, you know,
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.860]   we shouldn't treat them as completely monolithic entities
[00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:41.540]   that we can understand without understanding
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.100]   sort of all of the stuff that allows them to change
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:47.500]   in the ways that they do.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.180]   And that's where I think the connectionist
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.180]   feeds into the cognitive.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.340]   It's like, okay, so if the substrate
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.620]   is parallel distributed connectionist,
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:03.300]   then it doesn't mean that the contents of thought
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.960]   isn't, you know, like abstract and symbolic,
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.040]   but it's more fluid maybe than is easier to capture
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.380]   with a set of logical expressions.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.420]   - Yeah, that's a heck of a sort of thing to put
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:23.420]   at the top of a resume, radical emerginist connectionist.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:26.060]   So there is just like you said,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.580]   a beautiful dance between that,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:30.380]   between the machinery of intelligence,
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.340]   like the neural network side of it
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.340]   and the stuff that emerges.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:39.220]   I mean, the stuff that emerges seems to be,
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.380]   I don't know, I don't know what that is.
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:48.920]   It seems like maybe all of reality is emergent.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.860]   What I think about,
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.380]   this is made most distinctly rich to me
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.620]   when I look at cellular automata,
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:01.340]   look at game of life,
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.620]   that from very, very simple things,
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.780]   very rich, complex things emerge
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.260]   that start looking very quickly like organisms
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.620]   that you forget how the actual thing operates.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   They start looking like they're moving around,
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.460]   they're eating each other.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.100]   Some of them are generating offspring.
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.900]   You forget very quickly.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.980]   And it seems like maybe it's something about the human mind
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:28.620]   that wants to operate in some layer of the emergent
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.580]   and forget about the mechanism
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:32.220]   of how that emergence happens.
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:35.240]   So it just like you are in your radicalness,
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:41.340]   also it seems like unfair to eliminate the magic
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.040]   of that emergent.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.040]   Like eliminate the fact that that emergent is real.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.700]   - Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.300]   That's why I got rid of eliminative, right?
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:54.140]   - Eliminative, yeah.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.580]   - Yeah, because it seemed like that was trying to say
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:01.580]   that it's all completely like--
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:03.380]   - An illusion of some kind that's not--
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.580]   - Well, who knows whether there aren't
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:08.600]   some illusory characteristics there.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.480]   And I think that philosophically,
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:17.760]   many people have confronted that possibility over time,
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.760]   but it's still important to accept it as magic, right?
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:30.260]   So I think of Fellini in this context,
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:35.260]   I think of others who have appreciated the role of magic,
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   of actual trickery in creating illusions that move us.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:47.360]   And Plato was onto this too.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.860]   It's like somehow or other these shadows
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:55.980]   give rise to something much deeper than that.
[00:54:55.980 --> 00:55:01.020]   So we won't try to figure out what it is,
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.240]   we'll just accept it as given that that occurs.
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:08.640]   But he was still onto the magic of it.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.900]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:13.040]   We won't try to really, really, really deeply understand
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.320]   how it works, we'll just enjoy the fact
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.660]   that it's kind of fun.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:21.660]   Okay, but you worked closely with Dave Rommelhart.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:24.920]   He passed away as a human being.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.000]   What do you remember about him?
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Do you miss the guy?
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.500]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   He passed away 15-ish years ago now,
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:43.720]   and his demise was actually one of the most poignant
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:54.520]   and relevant tragedies relevant to our conversation.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:04.720]   He started to undergo a progressive neurological condition
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:14.980]   that isn't fully understood.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:19.760]   That is to say his particular course isn't fully understood
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:27.780]   because brain scans weren't done at certain stages
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:31.780]   and no autopsy was done or anything like that.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.140]   The wishes of the family.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:37.640]   So we don't know as much about the underlying pathology
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   as we might, but I had begun to get interested
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:49.700]   in this neurological condition that might have been
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.500]   the very one that he was succumbing to
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.640]   as my own efforts to understand another aspect
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.740]   of this mystery that we've been discussing
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:02.720]   while he was beginning to get progressively
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.360]   more and more affected.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.020]   So I'm gonna talk about the disorder
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.380]   and not about Rommelhart for a second, okay?
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.580]   The disorder is something my colleagues and collaborators
[00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.100]   have chosen to call semantic dementia.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   So it's a specific form of loss of mind related to meaning,
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.600]   semantic dementia.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:32.120]   And it's progressive in the sense that the patient
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:39.540]   loses the ability to appreciate the meaning
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.680]   of the experiences that they have,
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   either from touch, from sight, from sound, from language.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.200]   I hear sounds, but I don't know what they mean
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.180]   kind of thing.
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:58:02.700]   So as this illness progresses, it starts with
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:07.040]   the patient being unable to differentiate
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:14.680]   like similar breeds of dog or remember
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.120]   the lower frequency unfamiliar categories
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.080]   that they used to be able to remember.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   But as it progresses, it becomes more and more striking
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:32.200]   and the patient loses the ability to recognize
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   things like pigs and goats and sheep
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.600]   and calls all middle-sized animals dogs
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:47.040]   and can't recognize rabbits and rodents anymore.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.740]   They call all the little ones cats
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.520]   and they can't recognize hippopotamuses
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.840]   and cows where they call them all horses.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.760]   So there was this one patient who went through
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.040]   this progression where at a certain point,
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.820]   any four-legged animal, he would call it either a horse
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.120]   or a dog or a cat.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.680]   And if it was big, he would tend to call it a horse.
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.840]   If it was small, he'd tend to call it a cat.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.520]   Middle-sized ones he called dogs.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.000]   This is just a part of the syndrome though.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.620]   The patient loses the ability to relate
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:25.300]   concepts to each other.
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.800]   So my collaborator in this work, Carolyn Patterson,
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.320]   developed a test called the pyramids and palm trees test.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:39.520]   So you give the patient a picture of pyramids
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.940]   and they have a choice, which goes with the pyramids?
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:44.640]   Palm trees or pine trees?
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.980]   And she showed that this wasn't just a matter of language
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:55.740]   because the patient's loss of this ability shows up
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.300]   whether you present the material with words
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:00.220]   or with pictures.
[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.780]   The pictures, they can't put the pictures together
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.280]   with each other properly anymore.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.820]   They can't relate the pictures to the words either.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.700]   They can't do word picture matching.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.500]   But they've lost the conceptual grounding
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.780]   from either modality of input.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.780]   And so that's why it's called semantic dementia.
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:23.140]   The very semantics is disintegrating.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:28.140]   And we understand this in terms of our idea
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:30.460]   that distributed representation,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.980]   a pattern of activation represents the concepts.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.580]   Really similar ones, as you degrade them,
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.220]   they start being, you lose the differences.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.380]   And then, so the difference between the dog and the goat
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.580]   sort of is no longer part of the pattern anymore.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.460]   And since dog is really familiar,
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.340]   that's the thing that remains.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.500]   And we understand that in the way the models work and learn.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.300]   But Rommel-Hart underwent this condition.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:00.260]   So on the one hand, it's a fascinating aspect
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.420]   of parallel distributed processing to me.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:07.180]   And it reveals this sort of texture
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.620]   of distributed representation in a very nice way,
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.500]   I've always felt.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.660]   But at the same time, it was extremely poignant
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.780]   because this is exactly the condition
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.460]   that Rommel-Hart was undergoing.
[01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.900]   And there was a period of time when he was,
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:25.480]   this man who had been the most focused,
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:33.420]   goal-directed, competitive, (laughs)
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:40.900]   thoughtful person who was willing to work for years
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:47.340]   to solve a hard problem, he starts to disappear.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:53.780]   And there was a period of time when it was like,
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:59.180]   hard for any of us to really appreciate
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.420]   that he was sort of, in some sense,
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.500]   not fully there anymore.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.660]   - Do you know if he was able to introspect
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:12.660]   this dissolution of the understanding mind?
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:18.140]   Was he, I mean, this is one of the big scientists
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.100]   that thinks about this.
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.740]   Was he able to look at himself
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.480]   and understand the fading mind?
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.740]   - You know, we can contrast Hawking
[01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.460]   and Rommel-Hart in this way.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.180]   And I like to do that to honor Rommel-Hart
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.180]   because I think Rommel-Hart is sort of like
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:39.820]   the Hawking of cognitive science to me in some ways.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:46.200]   Both of them suffered from a degenerative condition.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.300]   In Hawking's case, it affected the motor system.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:54.180]   In Rommel-Hart's case, it's affecting the semantics.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:03:00.300]   And not just the pure object semantics,
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:05.340]   but maybe the self semantics as well.
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.140]   And we don't understand that.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.980]   - Concepts broadly.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:13.920]   - So I would say he didn't.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.740]   And this was part of what, from the outside,
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.660]   was a profound tragedy.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:22.940]   But on the other hand, at some level, he sort of did.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.660]   Because there was a period of time
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.620]   when it finally was realized
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.060]   that he had really become profoundly impaired.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.220]   This was clearly a biological condition
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.300]   and it wasn't just like he was distracted that day
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.180]   or something like that.
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:45.020]   So he retired from his professorship at Stanford
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:50.020]   and he lived with his brother for a couple years
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.860]   and then he moved into a facility
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.760]   for people with cognitive impairments.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:05.180]   One that many elderly people end up in
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.780]   when they have cognitive impairments.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   And I would spend time with him during that period.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:17.140]   This was in the late '90s, around 2000 even.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:22.140]   And we would go bowling and he could still bowl.
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:30.900]   And after bowling, I took him to lunch
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.340]   and I said, "Where would you like to go?
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.460]   "You wanna go to Wendy's?"
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.260]   And he said, "Nah."
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.740]   And I said, "Okay, well, where do you wanna go?"
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:40.260]   And he just pointed.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.580]   He said, "Turn here."
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.940]   So he still had a certain amount of spatial cognition
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.840]   and he could get me to the restaurant.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.500]   And then when we got to the restaurant,
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.020]   I said, "What do you wanna order?"
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:56.860]   And he couldn't come up with any of the words
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:59.820]   but he knew where on the menu the thing was that he wanted.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.860]   - That's so fascinating.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:05.340]   - He couldn't say what it was
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:07.640]   but he knew that that's what he wanted to eat.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:15.260]   It isn't monolithic at all.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:20.060]   Our cognition is, first of all,
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:24.140]   graded in certain kinds of ways but also multi-partite.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.580]   There's many elements to it and things,
[01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:32.140]   certain sort of partial competencies still exist
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:36.040]   in the absence of other aspects of these competencies.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:39.340]   So this is what always fascinated me
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   about what used to be called cognitive neuropsychology,
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:50.060]   the effects of brain damage on cognition.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.300]   But in particular, this gradual disintegration part.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.700]   I'm a big believer that the loss of a human being
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:02.340]   that you value is as powerful as first falling in love
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.340]   with that human being.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:06.940]   I think it's all a celebration of the human being.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:10.820]   So the disintegration itself too is a celebration in a way.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:17.740]   But just to say something more about the scientist
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.780]   and the backpropagation idea that you mentioned.
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:25.820]   So in 1982,
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:33.420]   Hinton had been there as a postdoc
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.860]   and organized that conference.
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:35.980]   He'd actually gone away
[01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.740]   and gotten an assistant professorship
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:41.660]   and then there was this opportunity to bring him back.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.860]   So Jeff Hinton was back on a sabbatical.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.560]   - San Diego. - In San Diego.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.380]   And Rumelhart and I had decided we wanted to do this
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.900]   we thought it was really exciting.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:59.420]   And the papers on the interactive activation model
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.580]   that I was telling you about had just been published.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.220]   And we both sort of saw a huge potential for this work
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.460]   and Jeff was there.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:12.460]   And so the three of us started a research group
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.020]   which we called the PDP Research Group.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.220]   And several other people came.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.020]   Francis Crick, who was at the Salk Institute
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.660]   heard about it from Jeff.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:28.340]   'Cause Jeff was known among Brits to be brilliant
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.140]   and Francis was well connected with his British friends.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.580]   So Francis Crick came.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.620]   - That's a heck of a group of people, wow.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:40.620]   - And several, Paul Spolensky was one of the other postdocs.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.020]   He was still there as a postdoc.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.900]   And a few other people.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.240]   But anyway,
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.380]   Jeff
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.860]   talked to us about learning
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.380]   and how we should think about
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:07.220]   how learning occurs in a neural network.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.300]   And he said, "The problem
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.220]   "with the way you guys have been approaching this
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:17.780]   "is that you've been looking for inspiration from biology
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:21.160]   "to tell you what the rules should be
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.020]   "for how the synapses should change
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.520]   "the strengths of their connections,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.400]   "how the connections should form."
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.120]   He said, "That's the wrong way to go about it.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.340]   "What you should do is you should think in terms of
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:42.160]   "how you can adjust connection weights to solve a problem.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.140]   "So you define your problem, and then you figure out
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.160]   "how the adjustment of the connection weights
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:54.260]   "will solve the problem."
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:09:00.380]   And Rommelhart heard that and said to himself,
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.500]   "Okay, so I'm gonna start thinking about it that way.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:09.500]   "I'm going to essentially imagine
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.060]   "that I have some objective function,
[01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:14.360]   "some goal of the computation.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:17.320]   "I want my machine to correctly classify
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.640]   "all of these images, and I can score that.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.460]   "I can measure how well they're doing on each image,
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.580]   "and I get some measure of error or loss,
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.780]   "it's typically called in deep learning.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:34.320]   "And I'm going to figure out
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.960]   "how to adjust the connection weights
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.440]   "so as to minimize my loss or reduce the error."
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.160]   And that's called gradient descent.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.040]   And engineers were already familiar
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.860]   with the concept of gradient descent.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   And in fact, there was an algorithm called the Delta Rule
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:04.380]   that had been invented by a professor
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:08.380]   in the electrical engineering department at Stanford,
[01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.740]   Woodrow, Bernie Woodrow, and a collaborator named Hoff.
[01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.260]   I never met him.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:18.260]   Anyway, so gradient descent in continuous neural networks
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:22.460]   with multiple neuron-like processing units
[01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:23.940]   was already understood
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:30.020]   for a single layer of connection weights.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.940]   We have some inputs over a set of neurons.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.200]   We want the output to produce a certain pattern.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.060]   We can define the difference between our target
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:41.620]   and what the neural network is producing,
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.740]   and we can figure out how to change the connection weights
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.260]   to reduce that error.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.820]   So what Romalhard did was to generalize that
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.100]   so as to be able to change the connections
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:56.660]   from earlier layers of units to the ones at a hidden layer
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:59.100]   between the input and the output.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:02.420]   And so he first called the algorithm
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.060]   the Generalized Delta Rule,
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:08.540]   because it's just an extension of the gradient descent idea.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.500]   And interestingly enough, Hinton was thinking
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.500]   that this wasn't going to work very well.
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:20.500]   So Hinton had his own alternative algorithm at the time
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.060]   based on the concept of the Boltzmann machine
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:25.100]   that he was pursuing.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.760]   So the paper on the Boltzmann machine came out in,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.520]   learning in Boltzmann machines came out in 1985,
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.820]   but it turned out that backprop worked better
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.420]   than the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.140]   - So this generalized delta algorithm
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.700]   ended up being called backpropagation,
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.900]   as you say, backprop.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.180]   - Yeah.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.180]   And probably that name is opaque to many people.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.660]   What does that mean?
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:57.940]   What it meant was that in order to figure out
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.140]   what the changes you needed to make
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.260]   to the connections from the input to the hidden layer,
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:08.580]   you had to backpropagate the error signals
[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:12.820]   from the output layer through the connections
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:14.900]   from the hidden layer to the output
[01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.480]   to get the signals that would be the error signals
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.140]   for the hidden layer.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.100]   And that's how Rumelhart formulated it.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.180]   It was like, well, we know what the error signals
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:26.340]   are at the output layer.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.020]   Let's see if we can get a signal at the hidden layer
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.460]   that tells each hidden unit
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.860]   what its error signal is, essentially.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.460]   So it's backpropagating through the connections
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.540]   from the hidden to the output to get the signals
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.100]   to tell the hidden units how to change their weights
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.700]   from the input, and that's why it's called backprop.
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:52.860]   Yeah, so it came from Hinton having introduced the concept
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:57.060]   of define your objective function,
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.860]   figure out how to take the derivative
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.580]   so that you can adjust the connections
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.940]   so that they make progress towards your goal.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:07.540]   - So stop thinking about biology for a second,
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.740]   and let's start to think about optimization
[01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.980]   and computation a little bit more.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.820]   So what about Jeff Hinton?
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:20.460]   You've gotten a chance to work with him in that little,
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:24.940]   the set of people involved there, it's quite incredible,
[01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.900]   the small set of people under the PDP flag.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:31.460]   It's just, given the amount of impact
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.180]   those ideas have had over the years,
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.660]   it's kind of incredible to think about.
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:39.180]   But just like you said, like yourself,
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.620]   Jeffrey Hinton is seen as one of the,
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.740]   not just like a seminal figure in AI,
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.460]   but just a brilliant person,
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.140]   just like the horsepower of the mind
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.420]   is pretty high up there for him
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.500]   'cause he's just a great thinker.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:57.500]   So what kind of ideas have you learned from him?
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.980]   Have you influenced each other on?
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.220]   Have you debated over,
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   what stands out to you in the full space of ideas here
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.860]   at the intersection of computation and cognition?
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:14.740]   - Well, so Jeff has said many things to me
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.860]   that had a profound impact on my thinking.
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:20.820]   And he's written several articles
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:25.080]   which were way ahead of their time.
[01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:32.660]   He had two papers in 1981, just to give one example,
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:43.460]   one of which was essentially the idea of transformers,
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:48.500]   and another of which was a early paper
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:53.980]   on semantic cognition, which inspired him and Rommelhart
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.980]   and me throughout the '80s,
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.980]   and still I think sort of grounds my own thinking
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:16.040]   about the semantic aspects of cognition.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:22.860]   He also, in a small paper that was never published
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:26.020]   that he wrote in 1977,
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.900]   before he actually arrived at UCSD,
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.740]   or maybe a couple of years even before that, I don't know,
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.380]   when he was a PhD student,
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:36.900]   he described how a neural network
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.080]   could do recursive computation.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:46.020]   And it was a very clever idea
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.920]   that he's continued to explore over time,
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.220]   which was sort of the idea that
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.660]   when you call a subroutine,
[01:15:56.660 --> 01:16:01.460]   you need to save the state that you had when you called it
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:03.180]   so you can get back to where you were
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.940]   when you're finished with the subroutine.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:09.940]   And the idea was that you would save the state
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.260]   of the calling routine
[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.820]   by making fast changes to connection weights,
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   and then when you finished with the subroutine call,
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.320]   those fast changes in the connection weights
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.260]   would allow you to go back to where you had been before
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.660]   and reinstate the previous context
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.020]   so that you could continue on
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:33.040]   with the top level of the computation.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.660]   Anyway, that was part of the idea.
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.900]   And I always thought, okay, that's really, you know,
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:42.620]   he had extremely creative ideas
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.300]   that were quite a lot ahead of his time,
[01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.220]   and many of them in the 1970s and early 1980s.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.720]   So another thing about Geoff Hinton's way of thinking,
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:02.360]   which has profoundly influenced my effort
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.960]   to understand human mathematical cognition
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:12.960]   is that he doesn't write too many equations.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.680]   And people tell stories like,
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.120]   oh, in the Hinton lab meetings,
[01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.280]   you don't get up at the board and write equations
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.520]   like you do in everybody else's machine learning lab.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.560]   What you do is you draw a picture. (laughs)
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.440]   And, you know, he explains aspects
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.480]   of the way deep learning works
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.800]   by putting his hands together
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.660]   and showing you the shape of a ravine
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:44.660]   and using that as a geometrical metaphor
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.440]   for what's happening as this gradient descent process.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.520]   You're coming down the wall of a ravine.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.640]   If you take too big a jump,
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.000]   you're gonna jump to the other side.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.720]   And so that's why we have to turn down
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.760]   the learning rate, for example.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   And it speaks to me of the fundamentally intuitive character
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:13.480]   of deep insight together with the fact
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:18.480]   that together with a commitment to really understanding
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   in a way that's absolutely, ultimately explicit and clear,
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.800]   but also intuitive.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.720]   - Yeah, there's certain people like that.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.520]   He's an example, some kind of weird mix of visual
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.640]   and intuitive and all those kinds of things.
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.360]   Feynman is another example, different style of thinking,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.640]   but very unique.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.740]   And when you're around those people,
[01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:48.680]   for me in the engineering realm,
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.520]   there's a guy named Jim Keller,
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.860]   who's a chip designer, engineer.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.600]   Every time I talk to him,
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.260]   it doesn't matter what we're talking about.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.000]   Just having experienced that unique way of thinking
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.360]   transforms you and makes your work much better.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.960]   And that's the magic.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:08.780]   You look at Daniel Kahneman,
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:10.720]   you look at the great collaborations
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.800]   throughout the history of science.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:13.640]   That's the magic of that.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.680]   It's not always the exact ideas that you talk about,
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.700]   but it's the process of generating those ideas,
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.820]   being around that, spending time with that human being,
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:25.100]   you can come up with some brilliant work,
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.760]   especially when it's cross-disciplinary
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.640]   as it was a little bit in your case with Jeff.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   - Yeah, Jeff is a descendant of the logician Boole.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   He comes from a long line of English academics.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:49.080]   And together with the deeply intuitive thinking ability
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:56.040]   that he has, he also has, it's been clear.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:00.000]   He's described this to me,
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.360]   and I think he's mentioned it from time to time
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:06.260]   in other interviews that he's had with people.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.400]   He's wanted to be able to sort of think of himself
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:16.400]   as contributing to the understanding of reasoning itself,
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:22.880]   not just human reasoning.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.720]   Like Boole is about logic, right?
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.200]   It's about what can we conclude from what else
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.880]   and how do we formalize that.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.880]   And as a computer scientist, logician,
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   philosopher, the goal is to understand
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:48.520]   how we derive truths from givens and things like this.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:53.520]   And the work that Jeff was doing in the early to mid '80s
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.880]   on something called the Bolton machine
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.320]   was his way of connecting with that Boolean tradition
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.200]   and bringing it into the more continuous,
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.540]   probabilistic-graded constraint satisfaction realm.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:17.760]   And it was beautiful, a set of ideas
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.360]   linked with theoretical physics,
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:27.120]   as well as with logic.
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:31.240]   And it's always been, I mean,
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.480]   I've always been inspired by the Bolton machine too.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:36.720]   It's like, well, if the neurons are probabilistic
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:40.440]   rather than deterministic in their computations,
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:45.440]   then maybe this somehow is part of the serendipity
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:54.240]   or adventitiousness of the moment of insight, right?
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.480]   It might not have occurred at that particular instant.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.400]   It might be sort of partially the result
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.520]   of a stochastic process.
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.400]   And that too is part of the magic of the emergence
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.120]   of some of these things.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.880]   - Well, you're right with the Boolean lineage
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   and the dream of computer science is somehow,
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.440]   I mean, I certainly think of humans this way,
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.480]   that humans are one particular manifestation of intelligence,
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.400]   that there's something bigger going on,
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.200]   and you're hoping to figure that out.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.440]   The mechanisms of intelligence, the mechanisms of cognition
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.120]   are much bigger than just humans.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.120]   - Yeah, so I think of, I started using the phrase
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:38.760]   computational intelligence at some point
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:43.040]   as to characterize the field that I thought,
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:48.040]   people like Geoff Hinton and many of the people
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:53.080]   I know at DeepMind are working in,
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.680]   and where I feel like I'm,
[01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.680]   I'm a kind of a human-oriented
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.960]   computational intelligence researcher
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.200]   in that I'm actually kind of interested
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.000]   in the human solution.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   But at the same time, I feel like that's where
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.640]   a huge amount of the excitement of deep learning
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.020]   actually lies is in the idea that,
[01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   we may be able to even go beyond what we can achieve
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:36.360]   with our own nervous systems when we build
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.200]   computational intelligences that are
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:47.000]   not limited in the ways that we are by our own biology.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.780]   - Perhaps allowing us to scale the very mechanisms
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:54.640]   of human intelligence, just increase its power through scale.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.360]   - Yes, and I think that that, obviously that's the,
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:07.240]   that's being played out massively at Google Brain,
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.000]   at OpenAI, and to some extent at DeepMind as well.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.040]   I guess I shouldn't say to some extent.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.960]   This massive scale of the computations that
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.360]   are used to succeed at games like Go
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.400]   or to solve the protein folding problems
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.240]   that they've been solving and so on.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.560]   - Still not as many synapses and neurons as the human brain.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.620]   So we still got, we're still beating them on that.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.960]   We humans are beating the AIs,
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.220]   but they're catching up pretty quickly.
[01:24:41.220 --> 01:24:46.360]   You write about modeling of mathematical cognition.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.140]   So let me first ask about mathematics in general.
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.720]   There's a paper titled
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.280]   Parallel Distributed Processing Approach
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.400]   to Mathematical Cognition, where in the introduction,
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.740]   there's some beautiful discussion of mathematics.
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:04.600]   And you reference there Tristan Needham,
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:07.520]   who criticizes a narrow form of view of mathematics
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:11.680]   by liking the studying of mathematics
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.840]   as simple manipulation to studying music
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.160]   without ever hearing a note.
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.880]   So from that perspective, what do you think is mathematics?
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.720]   What is this world of mathematics like?
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:28.480]   - Well, I think of mathematics as a set of tools
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:33.480]   for exploring idealized worlds
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:42.640]   that often turn out to be extremely relevant
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.900]   to the real world, but need not.
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.760]   But they're worlds in which
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:57.980]   objects exist with idealized properties,
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:06.720]   and in which the relationships among them
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.320]   can be characterized with precision
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   so as to allow the implications of certain facts
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.320]   to then allow you to derive other facts with certainty.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:28.160]   So, you know, if you have two triangles
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:36.600]   and you know that there is an angle in the first one
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:43.040]   that has the same measure as an angle in the second one,
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.560]   and you know that the lengths of the sides
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:50.080]   adjacent to that angle in each of the two triangles,
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:55.600]   the corresponding sides adjacent to that angle
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600]   also have the same measure,
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.240]   then you can then conclude that the triangles are congruent.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.960]   That is to say, they have all of their properties in common.
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.360]   And that is something about triangles.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.240]   It's not a matter of formulas.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.540]   These are idealized objects.
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:24.280]   In fact, you know, we built bridges out of triangles,
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.780]   and we understand how to measure the height
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.940]   of something we can't climb
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:35.940]   by extending these ideas about triangles a little further.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:42.120]   And, you know,
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:47.960]   all of the ability to get a tiny speck of matter
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:53.520]   launched from the planet Earth
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:57.120]   to intersect with some tiny, tiny little body
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.280]   way out in, way beyond Pluto somewhere
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.520]   at exactly a predicted time and date
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.840]   is something that depends on these ideas, right?
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.640]   So, but, and it's actually happening
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.800]   in the real physical world
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:20.480]   that these ideas make contact with it
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.180]   in those kinds of instances.
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:28.520]   And so, but you know,
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.060]   there are these idealized objects,
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:34.020]   these triangles or these distances or these points,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:39.020]   whatever they are, that allow for this set of tools
[01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:45.860]   to be created that then gives human beings the,
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.500]   it's this incredible leverage
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.780]   that they didn't have without these concepts.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:56.140]   And I think this is actually already true
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:02.340]   when we think about just, you know,
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:04.880]   the natural numbers.
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.420]   I always like to include zero,
[01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:11.700]   so I'm gonna say the non-negative integers,
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:15.940]   but that's a place where some people
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.060]   prefer not to include zero, but--
[01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.420]   - Oh, we like zero here.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:21.460]   Natural numbers, zero, one, two, three, four,
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:23.100]   five, six, seven, and so on.
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.500]   - Yeah, and you know, because they give you
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:31.500]   the ability to be exact about the things
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.500]   that you have, like how many sheep you have.
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:40.060]   Like, you know, I sent you out this morning,
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:43.420]   there were 23 sheep, you came back with only 22.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.180]   What happened, right?
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.720]   - The fundamental problem of physics,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:49.220]   how many sheep you have, yeah.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:53.100]   - It's a fundamental problem of human society
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.660]   that you damn well better bring back
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:56.900]   the same number of sheep as you started with.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:00.300]   And you know, it allows commerce,
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:04.260]   it allows contracts, it allows the establishment
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:08.540]   of records and so on to have systems
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.980]   that allow these things to be notated.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.740]   But they have an inherent aboutness to them
[01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:20.100]   that's one at the, one in the same time
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:23.380]   sort of abstract and idealized and generalizable
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.660]   while on the other hand,
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.100]   potentially very, very grounded and concrete.
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:35.980]   And one of the things that makes
[01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:42.060]   for the incredible achievements of the human mind
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:47.060]   is the fact that humans invented these idealized systems
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:52.580]   that leverage the power of human thought
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.900]   in such a way as to allow all this kind of thing to happen.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:01.820]   And so that's what mathematics to me
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.620]   is the development of systems for thinking about
[01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:12.300]   the properties and relations among sets of idealized objects.
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:18.580]   And you know, the mathematical notation system
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.960]   that we unfortunately focus way too much on
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.360]   is just our way of expressing propositions
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:37.080]   about these properties.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.840]   - Right, it's just like we're talking
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.520]   with Chomsky in language.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.040]   It's the thing we've invented
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.880]   for the communication of those ideas.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.520]   They're not necessarily the deep representation
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.640]   of those ideas.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.480]   - Yeah.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.400]   - What's a good way to model
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   such powerful mathematical reasoning, would you say?
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:02.480]   What are some ideas you have for capturing this in a model?
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:05.680]   - The insights that human mathematicians have had
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.680]   is a combination of the kind of the intuitive
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:17.400]   kind of connectionist-like knowledge
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   that makes it so that something is just like obviously true
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:31.040]   so that you don't have to think about why it's true.
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:37.480]   That then makes it possible to then take the next step
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:41.960]   and ponder and reason and figure out something
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.500]   that you previously didn't have that intuition about.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.560]   It then ultimately becomes a part of the intuition
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:55.560]   that the next generation of mathematical thinkers
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.400]   have to ground their own thinking on
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.160]   so that they can extend the ideas even further.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:08.040]   I came across this quotation from Henri Poincaré
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:14.160]   while I was walking in the woods with my wife
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:20.360]   in a state park in Northern California late last summer.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.460]   And what it said on the bench was,
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:30.800]   it is by logic that we prove,
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.960]   but by intuition that we discover.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.960]   And so what for me the essence of the project
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.280]   is to understand how to bring
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.280]   the intuitive connectionist resources to bear on
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:51.700]   letting the intuitive discovery arise
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:59.120]   from engagement in thinking with this formal system.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:05.640]   So I think of the ability of somebody like Hinton
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:14.260]   or Newton or Einstein or Romal Hart or Poincaré
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:21.280]   to Archimedes is another example, right?
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:25.800]   So suddenly a flash of insight occurs.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.800]   It's like the constellation of all of these
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.320]   simultaneous constraints that somehow or other
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.960]   causes the mind to settle into a novel state
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.560]   that it never did before and give rise to a new idea
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.880]   that then you can say, okay, well now,
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.700]   how can I prove this?
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.440]   How do I write down the steps of that theorem
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:00.900]   that allow me to make it rigorous and certain?
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:07.480]   And so I feel like the kinds of things
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:13.220]   that we're beginning to see deep learning systems do
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:19.740]   of their own accord kind of gives me this feeling
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:26.700]   of, I don't know, hope or encouragement
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:33.240]   that ultimately it'll all happen.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.660]   - So in particular, as many people now
[01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:45.660]   have become really interested in thinking about,
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:48.700]   neural networks that have been trained
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:53.700]   with massive amounts of text can be given a prompt
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:36:00.060]   and they can then sort of generate some really interesting,
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:03.200]   fanciful, creative story from that prompt.
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.900]   And there's kind of like a sense that they've somehow
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:16.820]   synthesized something like novel out of the,
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.520]   all of the particulars of all of the billions
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.440]   and billions of experiences that went into the training data
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:28.440]   that gives rise to something like this sort of
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:32.100]   intuitive sense of what would be a fun
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.040]   and interesting little story to tell
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.280]   or something like that.
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.640]   It just sort of wells up out of the,
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.840]   letting the thing play out its own imagining
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:47.800]   of what somebody might say given this prompt
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.800]   as a input to get it to start to generate its own thoughts.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.920]   And to me that sort of represents the potential
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:01.000]   of capturing the intuitive side of this.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.360]   - Yeah, and there's other examples.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.040]   I don't know if you find them as captivating as,
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:09.320]   you know, on the deep mind side with AlphaZero,
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:12.000]   if you study chess, the kind of solutions
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.960]   that has come up in terms of chess,
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.680]   there's novel ideas there.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:21.640]   It feels very like there's brilliant moments of insight.
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.380]   And the mechanism they use,
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:30.080]   if you think of search as maybe more
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.660]   towards the good old fashioned AI,
[01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:34.500]   and then there's the connectionist network
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:38.220]   that has the intuition of looking at a board,
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.580]   looking at a set of patterns and saying,
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.580]   how good is this set of positions?
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:45.460]   And the next few positions, how good are those?
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:46.460]   And that's it.
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:47.860]   That's just an intuition.
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:52.300]   Grandmasters have this and understanding positionally,
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.900]   tactically, how good the situation is,
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.180]   how can it be improved without doing this full,
[01:37:58.180 --> 01:38:02.320]   like deep search, and then maybe doing a little bit
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.760]   of what human chess players call calculation,
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.740]   which is the search, taking a particular set of steps
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:11.040]   down the line to see how they unroll.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.160]   But there is moments of genius in those systems too.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.900]   So that's another hopeful illustration
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:21.580]   that from neural networks can emerge
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:26.360]   this novel creation of an idea.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.080]   Yes, and I think that, I think Demis Hassabis is,
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:35.760]   he's spoken about those things.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:40.680]   I heard him describe a move that was made
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.400]   in one of the Go matches against Lee Sedol
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:46.240]   in a very similar way.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.120]   And it caused me to become really excited
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.080]   to kind of collaborate with some of those guys at DeepMind.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   So I think though that what I like to really emphasize here
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:10.560]   is one part of what I like to emphasize
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.540]   about mathematical cognition at least
[01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.540]   is that philosophers and logicians going back
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:25.380]   three or even a little more than 3,000 years ago
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:30.060]   began to develop these formal systems.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:36.060]   And gradually the whole idea about thinking formally
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:42.940]   got constructed.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:49.940]   And it's preceded Euclid, certainly President Euclid,
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:54.140]   certainly present in the work of Thales and others.
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.540]   And I'm not the world's leading expert
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:58.740]   in all the details of that history.
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:03.740]   But Euclid's elements were the kind of the touch point
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:09.660]   of a coherent document that sort of laid out
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:15.240]   this idea of an actual formal system
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.180]   within which these objects were characterized
[01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:24.180]   and the system of inference that allowed new truths
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:32.420]   to be derived from others
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:35.100]   was sort of like established as a paradigm.
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:40.100]   And what I find interesting is the idea
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   that the ability to become a person
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   who is capable of thinking in this abstract formal way
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:01.720]   is a result of the same kind of immersion
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:08.700]   in experience thinking in that way
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.940]   that we now begin to think of our understanding
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.180]   of language as being.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:18.180]   So we immerse ourselves in a particular language,
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:22.320]   in a particular world of objects and their relationships,
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.800]   and we learn to talk about that.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.200]   And we develop intuitive understanding of the real world.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.200]   In a similar way, we can think that what academia
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:39.480]   has created for us, what those early philosophers
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.340]   and their academies in Athens and Alexandria
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:49.340]   and other places allowed was the development
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:54.340]   of these schools of thought, modes of thought
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:57.100]   that then become deeply ingrained.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:02.100]   And it becomes what it is that makes it so
[01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:06.260]   that somebody like Jerry Fodor would think
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:11.260]   that systematic thought is the essential characteristic
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:18.960]   of the human mind as opposed to a derived,
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.760]   an acquired characteristic that results
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.360]   from acculturation in a certain mode
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:28.640]   that's been invented by humans.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.180]   - Would you say it's more fundamental than like language?
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:35.360]   If we start dancing, if we bring Chomsky
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.520]   back into the conversation, first of all,
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.280]   is it unfair to draw a line between mathematical cognition
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.640]   and language, linguistic cognition?
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:51.080]   - I think that's a very interesting question.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.960]   And I think it's one of the ones
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:56.320]   that I'm actually very interested in right now.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:04.080]   But I think the answer is, in important ways,
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.920]   it is important to draw that line,
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.800]   but then to come back and look at it again
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.080]   and see some of the subtleties
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.500]   and interesting aspects of the difference.
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:23.440]   So if we think about Chomsky himself,
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:34.240]   he was born into an academic family.
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:38.120]   His father was a professor of rabbinical studies
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.080]   at a small rabbinical college in Philadelphia.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.760]   And he was deeply enculturated in
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:55.480]   a culture of thought and reason
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:01.800]   and brought to the effort to understand natural language
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:07.560]   this profound engagement with these formal systems.
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:14.360]   And I think that there was tremendous power in that
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:22.940]   and that Chomsky had some amazing insights
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:25.360]   into the structure of natural language,
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:31.280]   but that, and I'm gonna use the word but there,
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.920]   the actual intuitive knowledge of these things
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.600]   only goes so far and does not go as far
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.400]   as it does in people like Chomsky himself.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:46.320]   And this was something that was discovered
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.160]   in the PhD dissertation of Lila Gleitman,
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.120]   who was actually trained in the same linguistics department
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:53.020]   with Chomsky.
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:59.100]   So what Lila discovered was that the intuitions
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.640]   that linguists had about even the meaning of a phrase,
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:11.120]   not just about its grammar,
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:15.760]   but about what they thought a phrase must mean
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.800]   were very different from the intuitions
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:23.800]   of an ordinary person who wasn't a formally trained thinker.
[01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:29.100]   And well, it recently has become much more salient.
[01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:31.480]   I happen to have learned about this when I myself
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.320]   was a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania,
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.480]   but I never knew how to put it together
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:39.480]   with all of my other thinking about these things.
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:44.480]   So I actually currently have the hypothesis
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.400]   that formally trained linguists
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:49.920]   and other formally trained academics,
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:57.740]   whether it be linguistics, philosophy,
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.260]   cognitive science, computer science,
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.440]   machine learning, mathematics,
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:12.320]   have a mode of engagement with experience
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:17.140]   that is intuitively deeply structured
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:22.140]   to be more organized around the systematicity
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:31.780]   and ability to be conformant with the principles
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:38.560]   of a system than is actually true
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.560]   of the natural human mind without that immersion.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.400]   - That's fascinating.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.740]   And so the different fields and approaches
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:48.700]   with which you start to study the mind
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:52.620]   actually take you away from the natural operation
[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:53.540]   of the mind.
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.300]   So it makes it very difficult for you
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:46:59.060]   to be somebody who introspects.
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:46:59.900]   - Yes.
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:04.900]   And this is where things about human belief
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:14.900]   and so-called knowledge that we consider private,
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:26.140]   not our business to manipulate in others.
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:29.220]   We are not entitled to tell somebody else
[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:33.020]   what to believe about certain kinds of things.
[01:47:33.020 --> 01:47:39.420]   What are those beliefs?
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:44.020]   Well, they are the product of this sort of immersion
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:46.760]   and enculturation.
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.880]   That is what I believe.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.380]   - So- - And that's limiting.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:57.280]   - It's something to be aware of.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:01.780]   - Does that limit you from having a good model
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:04.480]   of some of cognition?
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.900]   - It can.
[01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:08.300]   - So when you look at mathematical or linguistics,
[01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:10.680]   I mean, what is that line then?
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:14.780]   So is Chomsky unable to sneak up
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:16.240]   to the full picture of cognition?
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:20.220]   Are you, when you're focusing on mathematical thinking,
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:23.060]   are you also unable to do so?
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:24.380]   - I think you're right.
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:27.080]   I think that's a great way of characterizing it.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:32.080]   And I also think that it's related
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:38.460]   to the concept of beginner's mind
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:44.560]   and another concept called the expert blind spot.
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:51.180]   So the expert blind spot is much more prosaic-seeming
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:54.200]   than this point that you were just making.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:59.200]   But it's something that plagues experts
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.380]   when they try to communicate their understanding
[01:49:02.380 --> 01:49:03.580]   to non-experts.
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:08.580]   And that is that things are self-evident to them
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:17.300]   that they can't begin to even think about
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:23.300]   how they could explain it to somebody else
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:28.300]   because it's just so patently obvious
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:31.420]   that it must be true.
[01:49:31.420 --> 01:49:36.420]   And when Kronenker said,
[01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:47.060]   God made the natural numbers, all else is the work of man,
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.380]   he was expressing that intuition
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:56.460]   that somehow or other, the basic fundamentals
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:01.900]   of discrete quantities being countable and innumerable
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.660]   and indefinite in number was not something
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:14.740]   that had to be discovered, but he was wrong.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:21.180]   It turns out that many cognitive scientists
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:22.340]   agreed with him for a time.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:27.340]   There was a long period of time where the natural numbers
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.860]   were considered to be a part of the innate endowment
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:36.860]   of core knowledge or to use the kind of phrases
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:40.340]   that Spelke and Carey used to talk about
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.760]   what they believe are the innate primitives
[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.180]   of the human mind.
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:47.820]   And they no longer believe that.
[01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:52.340]   It's actually been more or less accepted
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.340]   by almost everyone that the natural numbers
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:58.100]   are actually a cultural construction.
[01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.540]   And it's so interesting to go back
[01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:03.380]   and sort of like study those few people who still exist
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:06.140]   who don't have those systems.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:08.940]   So this is just an example to me
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:14.740]   and where a certain mode of thinking about language itself
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:19.380]   or a certain mode of thinking about geometry
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:21.540]   and those kinds of relations,
[01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:24.060]   so it becomes so second nature that you don't know
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:25.900]   what it is that you need to teach.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:32.500]   And in fact, we don't really teach it
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.340]   all that explicitly anyway.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:40.340]   And it's, you take a math class,
[01:51:40.340 --> 01:51:44.000]   the professor sort of teaches it to you
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.120]   the way they understand it.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.100]   Some of the students in the class sort of like,
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.540]   they get it, they start to get the way of thinking
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:53.300]   and they can actually do the problems
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:55.380]   that get put on the homework
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.020]   that the professor thinks are interesting
[01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.020]   and challenging ones.
[01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:03.020]   But most of the students who don't kind of engage
[01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:05.460]   as deeply don't ever get.
[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:10.040]   And we think, oh, that man must be brilliant.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.940]   He must have this special insight,
[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:16.660]   but he must have some biological sort of bit
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:17.780]   that's different, right?
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:21.660]   That makes him so that he or she could have that insight.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:26.660]   But I'm, although I don't wanna dismiss
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:29.620]   biological individual differences completely,
[01:52:29.620 --> 01:52:34.060]   I find it much more interesting to think
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.740]   about the possibility that,
[01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:41.980]   it was that difference in the dinner table conversation
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.820]   at the Chomsky house when he was growing up
[01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:48.020]   that made it so that he had that cast of mind.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:51.300]   - Yeah, and there's a few topics we talked about
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.740]   that kind of interconnect.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:57.460]   'Cause I wonder, the better I get at certain things,
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:01.060]   we humans, the deeper we understand something,
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.980]   what are you starting to then miss
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:07.180]   about the rest of the world?
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:12.180]   We talked about David and his degenerative mind.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:19.380]   And when you look in the mirror and wonder,
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:22.100]   how different am I cognitively
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:24.380]   from the man I was a month ago,
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:26.300]   from the man I was a year ago?
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:31.300]   Like what, if I can, having thought about language
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:35.900]   if I'm Chomsky for 10, 20 years,
[01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:38.180]   what am I no longer able to see?
[01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:41.140]   What is in my blind spot and how big is that?
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:44.220]   And then to somehow be able to leap back
[01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:48.100]   out of your deep structure that you formed for yourself
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:49.940]   about thinking about the world,
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:53.260]   leap back and look at the big picture again,
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.960]   or jump out of your current way of thinking.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.340]   And to be able to introspect,
[01:53:58.340 --> 01:54:00.540]   like what are the limitations of your mind?
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:04.100]   How is your mind less powerful than it used to be
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.420]   or more powerful or different, powerful in different ways?
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:10.820]   So that seems to be a difficult thing to do
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:13.780]   'cause we're living, we're looking at the world
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:15.780]   through the lens of our mind, right?
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.460]   To step outside and introspect is difficult,
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:21.880]   but it seems necessary if you want to make progress.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:26.500]   - You know, one of the threads of psychological research
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:31.500]   that's always been very, I don't know,
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:35.980]   important to me to be aware of is the idea
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:40.980]   that our explanations of our own behavior
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:49.820]   aren't necessarily actually part of the process
[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:54.820]   that caused that behavior to occur,
[01:54:54.820 --> 01:55:01.900]   or even valid observations of the set of constraints
[01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:04.620]   that led to the outcome.
[01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:07.180]   But they are post hoc rationalizations
[01:55:07.180 --> 01:55:11.900]   that we can give based on information at our disposal
[01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:15.740]   about what might have contributed to the result
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:19.080]   that we came to when asked.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.340]   And so this is an idea that was introduced
[01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:28.060]   in a very important paper by Nisbet and Wilson
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:33.060]   about the limits on our ability to be aware of the factors
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:38.680]   that cause us to make the choices that we make.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:45.020]   And I think it's something that's very important
[01:55:45.240 --> 01:55:50.240]   and it's something that we really ought to be
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.760]   much more cognizant of in general as human beings
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:59.740]   is that our own insight into exactly why
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:03.120]   we hold the beliefs that we do and we hold the attitudes
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.060]   and make the choices and feel the feelings that we do
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:10.060]   is not something that we totally control
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.740]   or totally observe.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:20.740]   And it's subject to our culturally transmitted
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:28.180]   understanding of what it is that is the mode
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:33.180]   that we give to explain these things when asked to do so
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:37.060]   as much as it is about anything else.
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:40.820]   And so even our ability to introspect
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:43.440]   and think we have access to our own thoughts
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:48.080]   is a product of culture and belief, practice.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.940]   - So let me ask you the big question of advice.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:58.940]   So you've lived an incredible life in terms of the ideas
[01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:00.900]   you've put out into the world,
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.420]   in terms of the trajectory you've taken through your career,
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.420]   through your life.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:07.220]   What advice would you give to young people today
[01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:13.180]   in high school and college about how to be more open
[01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:15.980]   how to have a career or how to have a life
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:17.200]   they can be proud of?
[01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:24.120]   - Finding the thing that you are intrinsically motivated
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:29.120]   to engage with and then celebrating that discovery
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:34.760]   is what it's all about.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:40.540]   When I was in college, I struggled with that.
[01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:46.020]   I had thought I wanted to be a psychiatrist
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:50.780]   because I think I was interested in human psychology
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.620]   in high school.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:56.300]   And at that time, the only sort of information I had
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:58.380]   that had anything to do with the psyche was,
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:00.260]   you know, Freud and Eric Fromm
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:03.940]   and sort of popular psychiatry kinds of things.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:06.740]   And so, well, they were psychiatrists, right?
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.820]   So I had to be a psychiatrist.
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:11.380]   And that meant I had to go to medical school.
[01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:16.260]   And I got to college and I find myself taking, you know,
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.980]   the first semester of a three-quarter physics class
[01:58:19.980 --> 01:58:21.260]   and it was mechanics.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:24.420]   And this was so far from what it was I was interested in,
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.100]   but it was also too early in the morning
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:28.180]   in the winter court semester.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.860]   So I never made it to the physics class.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:35.660]   But I wandered about the rest of my freshman year
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:38.860]   and most of my sophomore year
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:44.860]   until I found myself in the midst of this situation
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:46.460]   where around me,
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:50.380]   there was this big revolution happening.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:53.340]   I was at Columbia University in 1968
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:56.020]   and the Vietnam War is going on.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:59.060]   Columbia's building a gym in Morningside Heights,
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:00.300]   which is part of Harlem.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:03.620]   And people are thinking, oh, the big, bad rich guys
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:06.460]   are stealing the parkland
[01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.240]   that belongs to the people of Harlem.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:12.660]   And, you know, they're part of the military
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:15.340]   industrial complex, which is enslaving us
[01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.780]   and sending us all off to war in Vietnam.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.540]   And so there was a big revolution
[01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:23.700]   that involved a confluence of black activism
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.860]   and, you know, SDS and social justice
[01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:30.020]   and the whole university blew up and got shut down.
[01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:33.860]   And I got a chance to sort of think about
[01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:38.660]   why people were behaving the way they were in this context.
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:42.940]   And I, you know, I happened to have taken
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:44.620]   mathematical statistics.
[01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:47.900]   I happened to have been taking psychology that quarter,
[01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:49.140]   just psych one.
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:53.540]   And somehow things in that space all ran together in my mind
[01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:57.780]   and got me really excited about asking questions
[01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:00.300]   about why people, what made certain people
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:03.460]   go into the buildings and not others and things like that.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:06.140]   And so suddenly I had a path forward
[02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:08.900]   and I had just been wandering around aimlessly.
[02:00:08.900 --> 02:00:11.900]   And at the different points in my career, you know,
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:15.500]   when I think, okay, well, should I take this class
[02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:16.340]   or should I
[02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:19.620]   just
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:22.500]   read that book about
[02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:29.100]   some idea that I wanna understand better, you know,
[02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:32.700]   or should I pursue the thing that excites me
[02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:34.940]   and interests me or should I, you know,
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:38.180]   meet some requirement, you know, that's,
[02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.460]   I always did the latter.
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:43.180]   So I ended up, my professors in psychology
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.180]   thought I was great.
[02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:48.260]   They wanted me to go to graduate school.
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:52.820]   They nominated me for Phi Beta Kappa
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:55.580]   and I went to the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.660]   and this guy came up and he said,
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:58.580]   "Oh, are you Magna or Summa?"
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:02.100]   And I wasn't even getting honors based on my grades.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:06.820]   They just happened to have thought I was interested enough
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.740]   in ideas to belong to Phi Beta Kappa.
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:09.660]   So--
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.060]   - I mean, would it be fair to say
[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:13.300]   you kind of stumbled around a little bit
[02:01:13.300 --> 02:01:18.380]   through accidents of too early morning of classes
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:21.060]   in physics and so on until you discovered
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:23.100]   intrinsic motivation, as you mentioned,
[02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:25.380]   and then that's it, it hooked you
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.660]   and then you celebrate the fact that this happens
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.780]   to human beings and it's like--
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.880]   - Yeah, like, and what is it that made
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:36.360]   what I did intrinsically motivating to me?
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.300]   Well, that's interesting and I don't know
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:44.060]   all the answers to it and I don't think I wanna,
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:49.060]   I want anybody to think that you should be sort of
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:52.900]   in any way, I don't know, sanctimonious
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:53.740]   or anything about it.
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:58.140]   You know, it's like, I really enjoyed
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.940]   doing statistical analysis of data.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:05.940]   I really enjoyed running my own experiment,
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:08.220]   which was what I got a chance to do
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:10.660]   in the psychology department that chemistry
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:13.460]   and physics had never, I never imagined
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:15.740]   that mere mortals would ever do an experiment
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.860]   in those sciences, except one that was in the textbook
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:21.460]   that you were told to do in lab class.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:23.740]   But in psychology, we were already,
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.500]   like even when I was taking Psych I,
[02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:27.700]   it turned out we had our own rat
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:30.160]   and we got to, after two set experiments,
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:32.900]   we got to, okay, do something you think of,
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:34.220]   you know, with your rat, you know?
[02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:39.060]   So it's the opportunity to do it myself
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:42.740]   and to bring together a certain set of things
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:45.460]   that engaged me intrinsically.
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:48.700]   And I think it has something to do
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:51.180]   with why certain people turn out to be,
[02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:56.180]   you know, profoundly amazing musical geniuses, right?
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:01.420]   They get immersed in it at an early enough point
[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:04.900]   and it just sort of gets into the fabric.
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:08.660]   So my little brother had intrinsic motivation for music
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.100]   as we witnessed when he discovered how
[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.900]   to put records on the phonograph
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:18.020]   when he was like 13 months old
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.740]   and recognize which one he wanted to play,
[02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:22.400]   not 'cause he could read the labels,
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:25.540]   because he could sort of see which ones had which scratches,
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:27.420]   which were the different, you know,
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.900]   oh, that's rapid E Espanol and that's--
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:30.740]   - Oh, wow.
[02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:31.580]   - You know, and--
[02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.860]   - And he enjoyed that, that connected with him somehow.
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:36.340]   - Yeah, and there was something that it fed into
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:40.940]   and you're extremely lucky if you have that
[02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:44.860]   and if you can nurture it and can let it grow
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:47.580]   and let it be an important part of your life.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:49.140]   - Yeah, those are the two things,
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:54.140]   is like be attentive enough to feel it when it comes.
[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:56.580]   Like this is something special.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:59.140]   I mean, I don't know, for example,
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:04.140]   I really like tabular data, like Excel sheets.
[02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:07.820]   Like it brings me a deep joy.
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:10.020]   I don't know how useful that is for anything.
[02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:12.260]   - That's part of what I'm talking about.
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:13.180]   - Exactly.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:15.620]   - So there's like a million, not a million,
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:18.460]   but there's a lot of things like that for me
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:20.220]   and you have to hear that for yourself.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:24.180]   Like realize this is really joyful,
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:25.900]   but then the other part that you're mentioning,
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:29.140]   which is the nurture, is take time and stay with it,
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:33.380]   stay with it a while and see where that takes you in life.
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:38.380]   - Yeah, and I think the motivational engagement
[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:42.040]   results in the immersion that then creates
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:45.340]   the opportunity to obtain the expertise.
[02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.780]   So we could call it the Mozart effect, right?
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:51.620]   I mean, when I think about Mozart,
[02:04:51.620 --> 02:04:55.860]   I think about the person who was born
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:59.220]   as the fourth member of the Family String Quartet, right?
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:04.220]   And they handed him the violin when he was six weeks old.
[02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:06.660]   All right, start playing.
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.720]   So the level of immersion there was amazingly profound,
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:20.040]   but hopefully he also had something,
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:28.000]   maybe this is where the more sort of the genetic part
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.400]   comes in sometimes, I think.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:33.960]   Something in him resonated to the music
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:36.680]   so that the synergy of the combination
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:38.520]   of that was so powerful.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.420]   So that's what I really consider to be the Mozart effect.
[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:46.420]   It's sort of the synergy of something with experience
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:49.820]   that then results in the unique flowering
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.080]   of a particular mind.
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:58.520]   So I know my siblings and I are all very different
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:06:00.260]   from each other.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:02.700]   We've all gone in our own different directions.
[02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:06.280]   And I mentioned my younger brother who was very musical.
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:08.980]   I had my other younger brother
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:11.940]   was like this amazing like intuitive engineer.
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:18.740]   And one of my sisters was passionate about
[02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:25.000]   water conservation well before it was
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.320]   such a hugely important issue that it is today.
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:34.320]   So we all sort of somehow find a different thing.
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.560]   And I don't mean to say it isn't tied in
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:43.440]   with something about us biologically,
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:47.040]   but it's also when that happens, where you can find that,
[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:50.800]   then you can do your thing and you can be excited about it.
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.640]   So people can be excited about fitting people on bicycles
[02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:56.040]   as well as excited about making neural networks,
[02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.480]   achieve insights into human cognition, right?
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:00.440]   - Yeah, like for me personally,
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.760]   I've always been excited about love
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.080]   and friendship between humans.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:09.920]   And just like the actual experience of it
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:13.200]   is since I was a child, just observing people around me
[02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:16.280]   and also been excited about robots.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:18.680]   And there's something in me that thinks
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:20.800]   I really would love to explore
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:22.240]   how those two things combine.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:23.760]   And it doesn't make any sense.
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.520]   A lot of it is also timing,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:28.200]   just to think of your own career and your own life.
[02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:30.680]   You find yourself in certain pieces,
[02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:32.960]   places that happen to involve
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:35.280]   some of the greatest thinkers of our time.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.040]   And so it just worked out that like,
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:38.880]   you guys developed those ideas
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:41.840]   and there may be a lot of other people similar to you
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:44.360]   and they were brilliant and they never found
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:46.100]   that right connection and place
[02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:48.000]   to where the ideas could flourish.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.680]   So it's timing, it's place, it's people.
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:55.680]   And ultimately the whole ride, it's undirected.
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:58.240]   Can I ask you about something you mentioned
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:00.760]   in terms of psychiatry when you were younger?
[02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:02.800]   Because I had a similar experience
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:08.080]   of reading Freud and Carl Jung
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:13.080]   and just those kind of popular psychiatry ideas.
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:15.840]   And that was a dream for me early on in high school
[02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:20.000]   to like, I hope to understand the human mind by,
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.800]   somehow psychiatry felt like the right discipline for that.
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.520]   Does that make you sad that psychiatry is not
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:34.640]   the mechanism by which you want to,
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:36.160]   are able to explore the human mind?
[02:08:36.160 --> 02:08:38.920]   So for me, I was a little bit disillusioned
[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.920]   because of how much prescription medication
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.000]   and biochemistry is involved in the discipline of psychiatry
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.600]   as opposed to the dream of the Freud,
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:53.800]   like use the mechanisms of language
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.600]   to explore the human mind.
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.760]   So that was a little disappointing.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:01.440]   And that's why I kind of went to computer science
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:04.160]   and thinking like, maybe you can explore the human mind
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:06.360]   by trying to build the thing.
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.660]   - Yes, I wasn't exposed to the,
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:14.780]   sort of the biomedical/pharmacological aspects
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:18.600]   of psychiatry at that point because I didn't,
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:21.920]   I dropped out of that whole idea of pre-med
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:25.600]   that I never even found out about that until much later.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.920]   But you're absolutely right.
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:31.000]   So I was actually a member of the
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:37.360]   National Advisory Mental Health Council.
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:40.480]   That is to say the board of scientists
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:43.600]   who advised the director of the National Institute
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.120]   of Mental Health.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:47.600]   And that was around the year 2000.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.600]   And in fact, at that time, the man who came in
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:56.360]   as the new director, I had been on this board for a year
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:01.280]   when he came in, said, okay,
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:06.840]   schizophrenia is a biological illness.
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:08.520]   It's a lot like cancer.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.160]   We've made huge strides in curing cancer
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.280]   and that's what we're gonna do with schizophrenia.
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:15.780]   We're gonna find the medications
[02:10:15.780 --> 02:10:18.240]   that are gonna cure this disease.
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:21.200]   And we're not gonna listen to anybody's grandmother anymore.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:26.200]   And good old behavioral psychology
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:30.200]   is not something we're going to support any further.
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:35.200]   And he completely alienated me from the institute
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:43.260]   and from all of its prior policies,
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.280]   which had been much more holistic,
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.120]   I think really at some level.
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:51.400]   And the other people on the board
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.480]   were like psychiatrists, right?
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:57.240]   Very biological psychiatrists.
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:10:58.560]   It didn't pan out, right?
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.280]   That nothing has changed in our ability
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.080]   to help people with mental illness.
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:12.080]   And so 20 years later, that particular path
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:15.280]   was a dead end as far as I can tell.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:17.000]   - Well, there's some aspect to,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.240]   and sorry to romanticize the whole philosophical
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:22.260]   conversation about the human mind,
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:25.600]   but to me, psychiatrists for a time
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:30.080]   held the flag of we're the deep thinkers.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.560]   In the same way that physicists are the deep thinkers
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.420]   about the nature of reality,
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:36.080]   psychiatrists are the deep thinkers
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:37.920]   about the nature of the human mind.
[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:40.680]   And I think that flag has been taken from them
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:43.040]   and carried by people like you.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:46.140]   It's more in the cognitive psychology,
[02:11:46.140 --> 02:11:48.000]   especially when you have a foot
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.120]   in the computational view of the world,
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.280]   'cause you can both build it,
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:54.440]   you can like intuit about the functioning of the mind
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.360]   by building little models
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.040]   and be able to say mathematical things
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:11:59.360]   and then deploying those models,
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:01.480]   especially in computers to say,
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.200]   does this actually work?
[02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.080]   And they do little experiments.
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:08.360]   And then some combination of neuroscience
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:12.000]   where you're starting to actually be able to observe,
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.240]   you know, do certain experiments on human beings
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:18.340]   and observe how the brain is actually functioning.
[02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:21.060]   And there, using intuition,
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:22.980]   you can start being the philosopher.
[02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:25.180]   Like Richard Feynman is the philosopher,
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:28.260]   a cognitive psychologist can become the philosopher
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:30.800]   and psychiatrists become much more like doctors.
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.280]   They're like very medical.
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:34.220]   They help people with medication,
[02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:35.660]   biochemistry and so on,
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:39.460]   but they are no longer the book writers
[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:40.300]   and the philosophers,
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:42.340]   which of course I admire.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.840]   I admire the Richard Feynman ability
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:49.680]   to do great low level mathematics and physics
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.100]   and the high level philosophy.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:57.100]   - Yeah, I think it was Fromm and Jung more than Freud
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:02.140]   that was sort of initially kind of like made me feel like,
[02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:04.760]   oh, this is really amazing and interesting
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.680]   and I wanna explore it further.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:10.640]   I actually, when I got to college and I lost that thread,
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:15.640]   I found more of it in sociology and literature
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.520]   than I did in any place else.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.600]   So I took quite a lot of both of those disciplines
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:25.820]   as an undergraduate.
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:31.880]   And, you know, I was actually deeply ambivalent
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:36.000]   about the psychology because I was doing experiments
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.440]   after the initial flurry of interest
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.240]   in why people would occupy buildings during an insurrection
[02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:49.240]   and consider, you know, be sort of like so over committed
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:51.840]   to their beliefs.
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:54.880]   But I ended up in the psychology laboratory
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:56.480]   running experiments on pigeons.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:01.200]   And so I had these profound sort of like dissonance
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.240]   between, okay, the kinds of issues that would be explored
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:09.280]   when I was thinking about what I read about
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.280]   in modern British literature versus what I could study
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.480]   with my pigeons in the laboratory.
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:19.800]   That got resolved when I went to graduate school
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:22.120]   and I discovered cognitive psychology.
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:27.120]   And so for me, that was the path out of this sort of like,
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.080]   extremely sort of ambivalent divergence
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:33.080]   between the interest in the human condition
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:37.080]   and the desire to do, you know,
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.100]   actual mechanistically oriented thinking about it.
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:46.080]   And I think we've come a long way in that regard
[02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:50.520]   and that you're absolutely right that nowadays
[02:14:50.520 --> 02:14:53.080]   this is something that's accessible to people
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.640]   through the pathway in through computer science
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:02.060]   or the pathway in through neuroscience.
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:05.980]   You know, you can get derailed in neuroscience
[02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:10.260]   down to the bottom of the system
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.180]   where you might find the cures of various conditions,
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:16.780]   but you don't get a chance to think
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:18.120]   about the higher level stuff.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:21.060]   So it's in the systems and cognitive neuroscience
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:24.020]   and computational intelligence,
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:25.640]   miasma up there at the top
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.580]   that I think these opportunities are most,
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:30.720]   are richest right now.
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:32.980]   And so yes, I am indeed blessed
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:37.980]   by having had the opportunity to fall into that space.
[02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.260]   - So you mentioned the human condition,
[02:15:41.260 --> 02:15:44.940]   speaking of which, you happen to be a human being
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:48.300]   who's unfortunately not immortal.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:52.980]   That seems to be a fundamental part of the human condition
[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:54.780]   that this ride ends.
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:59.780]   Do you think about the fact that you're going to die one day?
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:01.380]   Are you afraid of death?
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:09.660]   - I would say that I am not as much afraid of death
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:12.880]   as I am of degeneration.
[02:16:12.880 --> 02:16:19.380]   And I say that in part for reasons of having, you know,
[02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:25.660]   seen some tragic degenerative situations unfold.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:33.080]   It's exciting when you can continue to participate
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:41.020]   and feel like you're near the place
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:46.160]   where the wave is breaking on the shore, if you like.
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:52.920]   And I think about, you know, my own future potential
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.600]   if I were to undergo, begin to suffer from dementia,
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:06.920]   Alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.840]   or some other condition, you know,
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:13.440]   I would sort of gradually lose the thread of that ability.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:18.440]   And so one can live on for several,
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:24.880]   for a decade after, you know, sort of having to retire
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:29.880]   because one no longer has these kinds of abilities to engage.
[02:17:29.880 --> 02:17:35.560]   And I think that's the thing that I fear the most.
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:40.560]   - The losing of that, like the breaking of the wave,
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:44.120]   the flourishing of the mind where you have these ideas
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.720]   and they're swimming around, you're able to play with them.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:51.000]   - Yeah, and collaborate with other people who, you know,
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:56.000]   are themselves really helping to push these ideas forward.
[02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.920]   So, yeah.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.400]   - What about the edge of the cliff?
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:05.200]   The end, I mean, the mystery of it, I mean.
[02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:09.520]   - The migrated sort of conception of mind
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:12.800]   and, you know, sort of continuous sort of way
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:15.200]   of thinking about most things makes it so that,
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:21.640]   to me, the discreteness of that transition
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:27.160]   is less apparent than it seems to be to most people.
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:29.780]   - I see, I see, yeah.
[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:33.880]   Yeah, I wonder, so I don't know if you know the work
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:38.760]   of Ernest Becker and so on, I wonder what role mortality
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:42.160]   and our ability to be cognizant of it,
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:44.840]   anticipate it and perhaps be afraid of it,
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:49.840]   what role that plays in our reasoning of the world.
[02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:53.160]   - I think that it can be motivating to people
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:55.400]   to think they have a limited period left.
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:59.080]   I think in my own case, you know,
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.160]   it's like seven or eight years ago now
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:06.160]   that I was sitting around doing experiments
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:11.400]   on decision making that were satisfying in a certain way
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.480]   because I could really get closure
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:21.480]   on whether the model fit the data perfectly or not.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:25.000]   And I could see how one could test, you know,
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.800]   the predictions in monkeys as well as humans
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:30.880]   and really see what the neurons were doing.
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:34.240]   But I just realized, hey, wait a minute, you know,
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:37.800]   I may only have about 10 or 15 years left here
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:41.400]   and I don't feel like I'm getting towards the answers
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:43.360]   to the really interesting questions
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:46.680]   while I'm doing this particular level of work.
[02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.640]   And that's when I said to myself,
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:54.800]   okay, let's pick something that's hard, you know?
[02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:59.040]   So that's when I started working on mathematical cognition.
[02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:03.300]   And I think it was more in terms of,
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:06.880]   well, I got 15 more years possibly of useful life left,
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:08.760]   let's imagine that it's only 10.
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:12.120]   I'm actually getting close to the end of that now,
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.680]   maybe three or four more years.
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:15.980]   But I'm beginning to feel like,
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:18.100]   well, I probably have another five after that.
[02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:21.260]   So, okay, I'll give myself another six or eight.
[02:20:21.260 --> 02:20:23.960]   - But a deadline is looming and therefore--
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:25.560]   - It's not gonna go on forever.
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:30.560]   And so, yeah, I gotta keep thinking about the questions
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.560]   that I think are the interesting
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.120]   and important ones for sure.
[02:20:34.120 --> 02:20:37.480]   - What do you hope your legacy is?
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:40.320]   You've done some incredible work in your life
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:43.000]   as a man, as a scientist.
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:47.320]   When the aliens and the human civilization is long gone
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:49.800]   and the aliens are reading the encyclopedia
[02:20:49.800 --> 02:20:51.640]   about the human species,
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:54.340]   what do you hope is the paragraph written about you?
[02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:58.200]   - I would want it to sort of highlight
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:07.800]   a couple things that I was able to see
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:21.560]   one path that was more exciting to me
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.680]   than the one that seemed already to be there
[02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:28.360]   for a cognitive psychologist.
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:32.360]   But not for any super special reason
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:35.140]   other than that I'd had the right context prior to that,
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:38.960]   but that I had gone ahead and followed that lead.
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:41.800]   And then, I forget the exact wording,
[02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.800]   but I said in this preface that the joy of science
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:55.920]   is the moment in which a partially formed thought
[02:21:59.020 --> 02:22:04.020]   in the mind of one person gets crystallized
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:06.460]   a little better in the discourse
[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:11.460]   and becomes the foundation of some exciting,
[02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:15.580]   concrete piece of actual scientific progress.
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:18.380]   And I feel like that moment happened
[02:22:18.380 --> 02:22:19.820]   when Rumelhart and I were doing
[02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:22.020]   the interactive activation model
[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:26.140]   and when Rumelhart heard Hinton talk about gradient descent
[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:29.620]   and having the objective function
[02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:31.420]   to guide the learning process.
[02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:36.380]   And it happened a lot in that period
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:39.040]   and I sort of seek that kind of thing
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:42.940]   in my collaborations with my students.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:47.940]   So the idea that this is a person
[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:51.100]   who contributed to science
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:53.920]   by finding exciting collaborative opportunities
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:56.840]   to engage with other people through
[02:22:56.840 --> 02:22:59.080]   is something that I certainly hope
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:00.500]   is part of the paragraph.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:03.260]   - And like you said, taking a step
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:07.700]   maybe in directions that are non-obvious.
[02:23:07.700 --> 02:23:11.640]   So it's the old Robert Frost, road less taken.
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:16.640]   So maybe, 'cause you said like this incomplete initial idea,
[02:23:16.640 --> 02:23:21.960]   that step you take is a little bit off the beaten path.
[02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.640]   - If I could just say one more thing here.
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:29.080]   This was something that really contributed
[02:23:29.080 --> 02:23:30.720]   to energizing me in a way
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:35.220]   that I feel it would be useful to share.
[02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:40.220]   My PhD dissertation project
[02:23:40.220 --> 02:23:44.320]   was completely empirical experimental project.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:49.320]   And I wrote a paper based on the two main experiments
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:51.760]   that were the core of my dissertation.
[02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:53.920]   And I submitted it to a journal.
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:56.640]   And at the end of the paper,
[02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:01.040]   I had a little section where I laid out
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:05.160]   the beginnings of my theory
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:08.080]   about what I thought was going on
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:11.160]   that would explain the data that I had collected.
[02:24:11.160 --> 02:24:14.080]   And I had submitted the paper
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.480]   to the Journal of Experimental Psychology.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.600]   So I got back a letter from the editor saying,
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:22.560]   "Thank you very much, these are great experiments.
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:24.700]   "We'd love to publish them in the journal.
[02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:26.260]   "But what we'd like you to do
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:28.840]   "is to leave the theorizing to the theorists
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:32.200]   "and take that part out of the paper."
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:36.300]   And so I did, I took that part out of the paper.
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:42.400]   But I almost found myself labeled
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:45.520]   as a non-theorist by this.
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:49.880]   And I could have succumbed to that and said,
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:51.980]   "Okay, well, I guess my job is to just go on
[02:24:51.980 --> 02:24:54.200]   "and do experiments, right?"
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:59.200]   But that's not what I wanted to do.
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:03.600]   And so when I got to my assistant professorship,
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:06.640]   although I continued to do experiments
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.320]   because I knew I had to get some papers out,
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.920]   I also, at the end of my first year,
[02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.960]   submitted my first article to Psychological Review,
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:16.440]   which was the theoretical journal,
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:19.240]   where I took that section and elaborated it
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:21.640]   and wrote it up and submitted it to them.
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:24.320]   And they didn't accept that either,
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:26.120]   but they said, "Oh, this is interesting.
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:28.320]   "You should keep thinking about it this time."
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:31.340]   And then that was what got me going to think,
[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:35.920]   "Okay, so it's not a superhuman thing
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.700]   "to contribute to the development of theory.
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:43.700]   "You don't have to be, you can do it as a mere mortal."
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:47.600]   - And the broader, I think, lesson is
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.680]   don't succumb to the labels of a particular reviewer.
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:51.520]   - Yeah, that's for sure.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:53.760]   (laughing)
[02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:56.080]   Or anybody labeling you, right?
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:56.920]   - Exactly.
[02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.080]   Especially as you become successful,
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.220]   labels get assigned to you
[02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:05.920]   for that you're successful for that thing.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.520]   - Yeah, I'm a connectionist or a cognitive scientist
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:10.000]   and not a neuroscientist, whatever.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.040]   - And then you can completely,
[02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:14.780]   that's just, that's the stories of the past.
[02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:16.800]   You're, today, a new person
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:20.280]   that can completely revolutionize in totally new areas.
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.160]   So don't let those labels hold you back.
[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:26.240]   Well, let me ask the big question.
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:29.960]   When you look into the,
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:31.680]   you said it started with Columbia
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:33.120]   trying to observe these humans
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:34.920]   and they're doing weird stuff
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:37.360]   and you wanna know why are they doing this stuff.
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:39.680]   So let's zoom out even bigger.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.400]   At the hundred plus billion people
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:44.260]   who've ever lived on Earth,
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:48.880]   why do you think we're all doing what we're doing?
[02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:50.400]   What do you think is the meaning of it all?
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:51.740]   The big why question.
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:54.480]   We seem to be very busy doing a bunch of stuff
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:58.240]   and we seem to be kind of directed towards somewhere,
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:00.640]   but why?
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:08.360]   - Well, I myself think that we make meaning for ourselves
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:14.440]   and that we find inspiration in the meaning
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.520]   that other people have made in the past.
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:21.440]   And the great religious thinkers
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:27.000]   of the first millennium BC
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000]   and few that came in the early part
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.840]   of the second millennium
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:40.960]   laid down some important foundations for us.
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.720]   But I do believe that we are an emergent result
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:56.000]   of a process that happened naturally without guidance
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:01.000]   and that meaning is what we make of it
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:08.520]   and that the creation of efforts to reify meaning
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:14.320]   in religious traditions and so on
[02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:18.240]   is just a part of the expression of that goal
[02:28:18.240 --> 02:28:23.240]   that we have to not find out what the meaning is
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:29.640]   but to make it ourselves.
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:36.360]   So to me, it's something that's very personal,
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:43.160]   it's very individual, it's like meaning will come for you
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:49.280]   through the particular combination of synergistic elements
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.960]   that are your fabric and your experience
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:57.960]   and your context and you should,
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:08.840]   it's all made in a certain kind of a local context though.
[02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.980]   Here I am at UCSD with this brilliant man, Rommelhart,
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:20.320]   who's having these doubts about
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:24.920]   symbolic artificial intelligence
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:27.680]   that resonate with my desire
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:29.800]   to see it grounded in the biology
[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:34.800]   and let's make the most of that.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:38.760]   - Yeah, and so from that little pocket,
[02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:43.600]   there's some kind of peculiar little emergent process
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:47.200]   that then, which is basically each one of us,
[02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:49.720]   each one of us humans is a kind of,
[02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:52.000]   you think cells and they come together
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.200]   and it's an emergent process
[02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:58.600]   that then tells fancy stories about itself
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:01.520]   and then gets, just like you said,
[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:03.480]   just enjoys the beauty of the stories
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:04.840]   we tell about ourselves.
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:09.260]   It's an emergent process that lives for a time,
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:14.260]   is defined by its local pocket and context in time and space
[02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:15.760]   and then tells pretty stories
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:17.040]   and we write those stories down
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.480]   and then we celebrate how nice the stories are
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:20.880]   and then it continues
[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:23.260]   'cause we build stories on top of each other
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:28.080]   and eventually we'll colonize, hopefully, other planets,
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:31.720]   other solar systems, other galaxies
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:34.000]   and we'll tell even better stories.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.240]   But it all starts here on Earth.
[02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:42.240]   Jay, you're speaking of peculiar emergent processes
[02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:45.240]   that lived one heck of a story.
[02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:49.760]   You're one of the great scientists
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:55.640]   of cognitive science, of psychology, of computation.
[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.920]   It's a huge honor that you would talk to me today,
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.320]   that you spend your very valuable time.
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:03.640]   I really enjoy talking with you
[02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:05.160]   and thank you for all the work you've done.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:07.160]   I can't wait to see what you do next.
[02:31:07.160 --> 02:31:08.320]   - Well, thank you so much
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:11.640]   and this has been an amazing opportunity for me
[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:16.300]   to let ideas that I've never fully expressed before come out
[02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:20.760]   'cause you ask such a wide range of the deeper questions
[02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.560]   that we've all been thinking about for so long.
[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:24.960]   So thank you very much for that.
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:26.600]   - Thank you.
[02:31:26.600 --> 02:31:28.280]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:29.600]   with Jay McClelland.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:31.000]   To support this podcast,
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.640]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:35.360]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:36.920]   from Geoffrey Hinton.
[02:31:36.920 --> 02:31:40.840]   "In the long run, curiosity-driven research works best.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:43.420]   "Real breakthroughs come from people focusing
[02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:45.040]   "on what they're excited about."
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:48.680]   Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:51.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:53.840]   (upbeat music)
