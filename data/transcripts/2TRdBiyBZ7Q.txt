[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Emmanuel from Sweden writes in to ask Pastor John, "How evangelistic for
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.400]   non-believers should the Sunday gathering be?"
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   Well, when I hear the term "Sunday gathering," I take it to refer to the
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.800]   people of God gathered for worship. There's nothing wrong with having
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.720]   evangelistic services designed totally for unbelievers on Sunday. There's nothing
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920]   in the Bible that says, "Don't evangelize on Sunday with meetings," but that would
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   not be the stated gathering of God's people for worship. And I know, too, that
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.720]   not all Christians believe that the New Testament even calls us to have
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.080]   corporate worship services once a week. I've talked with people in this category
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.600]   who think the only thing Christians should get together for is edification,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.760]   not for worship. Now, I think that's a mistake, but I won't try to defend it
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.240]   here. I think we are called to corporate worship as the people of God. Then the
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.960]   question becomes, "What place does evangelism have in that service?" That's
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:28.520]   the real question, and I would want to say that that service should be
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.560]   wonderfully and gloriously vertical in its focus. We should focus on God, and
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.080]   there are a lot of people who think that because there are many, many, many good
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.360]   things in the Christian life, all of those should be dumped into that one
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.680]   service. So we need a place for ministry to children there. We need a place for
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   community communication there. We need a place for art of drama and painting, and
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000]   we need evangelism there. We need concerts there. We need political
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.120]   activism there. And when you're done, week after week after week, something becomes
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.380]   very man-centered, the vertical focus is blunted, and it weakens, and a power goes
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.200]   out of the church, even while you're trying to empower all of those things. So
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   the implication I think this has for direct evangelism is to say that it is
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:34.160]   always secondary in the corporate worship gatherings of God's people. We
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.080]   should gather in order to commune corporately with our Father and with our
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.880]   Lord Jesus Christ and magnify him in the enjoyment that we take in him through
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.800]   singing and praying and confession and thanksgiving and preaching and the
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   sacraments, and evangelism happens the way it does in 1st Corinthians 14. If
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.880]   people prophesy in this service, that is, if people speak with remarkable
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.840]   penetrating insight from God, people are convicted and called to account, and the
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.960]   secrets of their heart are disclosed. So they fall down on their face and worship
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.680]   God and say, "God is really in this place." So I believe evangelism
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.960]   happens when people meet God authentically, because the Word of God is
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   being spoken, and faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   It's the same gospel that builds people up, saves people, and the unbeliever who's
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.240]   sitting there while feeling out of place at first, which is inevitable, might come
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.200]   to have his heart opened, his eyes made keen to see the beauty of Christ. He
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   falls down on his face, taste buds are awakened for the beauty of Christ, and he
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.880]   loves and trusts Jesus, and then, "These are my people. I'm not a
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.600]   foreigner anymore here." I think that happens while evangelism is in secondary
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.320]   position and vertical, radical, hard pursuit of God is in first position.
