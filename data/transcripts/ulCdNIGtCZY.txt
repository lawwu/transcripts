[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   >> Well, good afternoon.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.660]   It is such a joy to be with you.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.480]   Welcome to everyone who has come both from near and far.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.160]   I've heard people coming as far as from New York and places like Ohio and the Midwest.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.800]   I'm a Midwesterner myself,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.800]   so I resonate with that and I appreciate the East Coast.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.280]   So we're just so thrilled to have everyone here and our heart
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.080]   is to encourage you.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.240]   We understand both the importance of the scientific disciplines,
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.840]   STEM and everything,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.380]   but at the same time, we also understand that it can be difficult.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.080]   There are challenges for all of you who are involved in so great an endeavor.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.800]   So our heart is just to bring like-minded believers together so that you all can have
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.620]   mutual edification and go back to where you're ministering and working in,
[00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.580]   and to be just strengthened in the Lord.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.840]   So if we can offer you that service,
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.520]   that is our absolute joy.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.920]   I was able to just observe the fellowship happening at lunch,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.960]   and it was just encouraging to my heart because it seems like that task is being accomplished.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.980]   Well, let me begin us with a word of prayer and then we will
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.240]   jump into what the Lord has for us providentially this afternoon.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.760]   Our God and Father,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.520]   as we think of so many matters,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.440]   particular and technical, nuanced in nature,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   ultimately we still yet understand that it is all subject to your word,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.640]   and that the issues that we face,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.760]   though specific they may be,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.680]   in the end, they are addressed by
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.400]   the eternal transcendent truths of the scriptures which you have revealed.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.760]   So we ask that in times of discouragement and in times of challenges and trials,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.400]   that the word of God minister deeply to our heart,
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.680]   and even more than that,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.320]   the God of the word be glorified.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.220]   To that end, O God,
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.700]   grant us clarity and joy and encouragement,
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.480]   and ultimately worship as we go through the text of your revelation this afternoon.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.600]   In your name we pray. Amen.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.360]   Well, like I said,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960]   this conference, at least from my vantage point,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.480]   is about encouragement.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.000]   It is about finding some respite from the storm of the world that can be around us,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720]   in the face particularly of industry or even in education.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   And so I do want to encourage you,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.360]   because what really can I, as an individual, contribute to your knowledge?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.960]   You guys are the experts.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960]   You guys are the specialists.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.680]   And yes, I will admit this, I am a son of scientists.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   My parents were chemists.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.160]   They worked in the industry.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.600]   My church growing up, every person,
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   I think almost every person in my church had a PhD in some field of science.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.720]   That's the way we grew up.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.400]   One of the few magazines that I had in my home growing up was Chemical and Engineering News.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.360]   Thank you.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.640]   I thought that's what every kid grew up with.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.240]   And I would read it, and I wouldn't understand most of it,
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.960]   but, you know, in the back there are these jokes.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.520]   And I really appreciated that section.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.760]   I thought that was the kid's section for all the parents, you know, and things like that.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   So that's how I grew up.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.040]   I grew up talking about patents, and grants, and labs, and OSHA.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   When I heard that word, it wasn't used very positively.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.520]   But people talked about these things, and experiments.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.880]   And as children, my friends and myself, we all knew that this was the case,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.800]   that whenever we asked our parents a question about science or math,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   we were hoping just to get the answer so we could finish our homework.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.440]   But we knew what would happen.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.760]   We would get a lecture instead.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.320]   And then after the lecture, we'd get more homework.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   Because clearly, we didn't know what we were doing.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   So our parents thought, well, you got to get reinforcement and got to do it for two more hours
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.680]   just to solve the same kind of problem over, and over, and over, and over again.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.160]   It was a very effective strategy to quash questions.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.720]   In any case, I was a son of scientists.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.960]   And to be clear, I so value the sacrifices that my parents made and investment
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.880]   in that way my parents made in me.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.560]   I may be a son of scientists, but I am not a scientist in that regard.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320]   But I can encourage you.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.280]   I can encourage you.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.400]   My job might not be to expand the specialized fields that you have,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.840]   but I would love to be able, by the grace of God, to strengthen your own heart in Him.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   And before I get into the main topic of encouragement that I want to go through this afternoon,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:19.000]   I would be remiss if I did not talk to you about the nobility, the worshipfulness,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.600]   the glory, and the honor that God has given in the sciences, in math and science, in all of STEM.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.280]   And I think this is very important because sometimes in churches and sometimes when you meet
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.560]   with fellow believers who are not in the discipline, they say, "What do you do for a living?"
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.840]   And then you say, "I work in this."
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.880]   And then their reaction is, "Cool."
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   And then after an awkward silence, they say, "So what's the point of that?"
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.800]   And of course, that can be a little bit insulting.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   And sometimes in churches, there can be even suspicion about science.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.640]   And I recognize that too, and all of that can be discomforting.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.200]   All of that can be discouraging.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:13.720]   And so I would be remiss if I did not just first and foremost establish and encourage your heart
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.840]   that what you are doing can and should be done for the glory of Christ,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.960]   that God has a purpose behind these disciplines.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.320]   Now, to be clear, reason never overrides revelation.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.800]   Reason never trumps the God who made the universe and ordained what it is.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.120]   In fact, reason presupposes that.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.480]   Reason depends upon that.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.560]   And we understand that the Scriptures, theologically speaking,
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.240]   provide three categories of information.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.440]   It provides the category of what we call special revelation that is focally found
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.440]   in the Scriptures.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.040]   That is God's particular, detailed, specific revelation about himself.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.680]   God discloses these things, and it is powerful because as Psalm 19 reminds us,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.480]   it is what converts the soul.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.560]   That is the power of special revelation.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.120]   And then a second category the Scripture reveals is general revelation.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.840]   And it is general in every sense.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   It is general in scope and in source because it is found in creation in its totality,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.560]   not in its specialization.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.120]   It is general because it reaches to all people and makes them without excuse.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.120]   It is general in even what it declares.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.880]   It does not declare every single detail about God, but what Psalm 19 and Romans 1
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.520]   remind us, it declares that God exists and that he is powerful.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.880]   It declares the divineness of his nature in that way.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.120]   And it is general even in its effects because general revelation cannot convert
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.680]   anyone to Christ.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.360]   That is why Psalm 19 contrasts general revelation, the heavens are declaring the
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.920]   glory of God, with special revelation, the word of Yahweh is perfect,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.440]   converting the soul.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.400]   And Romans 1 reminds us that people suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   And so general revelation, though declaring the glory of God,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.880]   cannot convert the soul.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.720]   It gives you just enough information so that all men and all people are
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.120]   without excuse.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.560]   But there is a third category of information, and that is what the Bible
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.560]   terms as knowledge.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   Unlike the first two, which are about revelation, God unveiling,
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:33.480]   God disclosing himself, knowledge is us discerning things God has done.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.880]   Knowledge is us looking at things, and observing things, and deriving things
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.960]   from what God has established.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:47.880]   One is God declaring it to us, the other one is us deriving things.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.120]   And they are two categorically different areas of information.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.440]   And often what can happen when we are not careful is we elevate our reason on the
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.880]   level of general revelation, thinking that, "Well, general revelation talks
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.000]   about creation, I'm talking about creation, so they must be the same thing."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.920]   And then we elevate general revelation, or what we call general revelation,
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.640]   to the level of special revelation.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.600]   "Oh, well, then that means that my discoveries must be on the level
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   of Scripture.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.120]   That is a dangerous road."
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.200]   They are different and distinct areas of knowledge.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.240]   The way they are disclosed, the way they are derived, what they do,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.720]   what they communicate, and their substance, we can never get them confused.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:38.480]   Nevertheless, while reason can never override revelation, what scientific reason
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.440]   in the providence of God does, it expounds upon the ramifications
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.840]   of revelation.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.160]   It explores the ramifications, and the consequences, and the ripple effects
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.640]   of all that God has revealed in Scripture because the Scripture has told us who God
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.440]   is, and the Scripture has told us what God has done, that He is who He is,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.920]   I am who I am, and He has made the heavens and the earth.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.000]   And science, and STEM, and math, and all these areas of observation
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.280]   and discovery, find, and locate, and explore all that God has already done,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.520]   and all that God is as He has revealed in His Word.
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.920]   You could think of it this way, Scripture establishes who God is,
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.320]   and science expounds upon what God has already established.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.080]   Grace is being translated in that way into science.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.480]   Think of it this way, science is then the magnification of God back to God.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.960]   It is the magnification of God back to God.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.520]   You say, "What do you mean by that?"
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   Well, it's really derived from Philippians 1 where Paul says,
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.680]   "In everything I do, I want Christ to be magnified."
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.000]   There are two ways to magnify something.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.640]   One way is that you take something itty-bitty, and you put it under the
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   microscope, and it magnifies it so it becomes larger.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.600]   You take the small and make it bigger.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.280]   Or you can magnify something similar to how a telescope works,
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.640]   where you take something that actually truly is very big, but we have thought
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.240]   of it as small, and we magnify it so that we see it the way it really is,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.600]   the greatness that is really there.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.720]   And science, like all of life, should be doing the latter with God.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.080]   Science has the ability, and it's a noble discipline.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.440]   It's a worshipful discipline because it can make every miracle and show the power
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.280]   of every miracle.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.800]   I was one time talking with a neuroscientist who said, "How do you make
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.240]   somebody lame walk and function?
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.760]   How do you make somebody with a withered hand, whose hand is disheveled,
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.280]   to actually be whole?"
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.240]   And he was talking about all the ways that the nerves would have to be
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.120]   reconstructed, and all the ways the pathways to the brain would have
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.600]   to be reconstituted.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.960]   And he said, "If any scientist could do that, they would make billions
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.600]   of dollars."
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:21.320]   And he said, "It's amazing that Jesus can just say it, and it happens."
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.880]   Science discovers the greatness of God in miracles.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.200]   It glorifies his wisdom in creation.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.240]   When we look at creation and we say, "Wow, that's genius.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.080]   He's genius," that's what we're really saying.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.960]   Likewise, science exalts his supernatural power, his sovereignty over everything,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.680]   and his unique wisdom and transcendence.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.840]   Psalm 104 is a good example of this.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.320]   In Psalm 104, the psalmist recounts how God made the earth in six days,
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   rested on the seventh.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.480]   But in that framework, he says, that is the psalmist, on all the wonders
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.600]   of how God made things and how he uses them for his glory.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.760]   What I like to remind my students to illustrate this point is,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.200]   just even think of the way God created water.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.160]   He created water in such a way that it can flood the earth.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.280]   If you were me and you just thought it'd be hilarious to make water more
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.520]   like Jell-O because, you know, I like Jell-O or whatever, then you couldn't...
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.960]   It's very difficult to flood the world with the viscosity of Jell-O.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.640]   It's very difficult to allow Jell-O to water the plants.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.880]   That's what Psalm 104 says, that the water that takes away life is the
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.320]   same water that gives life, and feeds the plants, and feeds the animals,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.240]   and feeds the humans, and gives beverage, and liquid, and life,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.840]   and hydration to all.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   That's the brilliance of God.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.960]   In sum, you could think of it this way, science is such a noble endeavor because
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.320]   what it constantly is discovering is how great thou art.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.200]   That is the endeavor of science, and it's a noble one.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.040]   It is a noble endeavor.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.880]   In whatever you are doing, whether that be working with bacteria,
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.640]   or DNA, or a chemical, or a compound, or an equation,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.520]   what you are magnifying to God is the depths of how great thou art.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.480]   There is the nobility of your discipline.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:34.360]   Whatever you may be doing, that is what ultimately, when done rightly,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.000]   is happening.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.040]   And for that reason, you need to be encouraged.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.720]   You're not wasting your time.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.400]   Even sometimes when believers give you a funny stare, and they don't understand
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.640]   exactly what you do, even when your kids look at you funny and say,
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.120]   "Dad, I don't understand what you're doing."
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.800]   God knows.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.640]   And it's an act of an amazing worship back to him because you are magnifying the
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.400]   greatness of God back to himself.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.320]   So be encouraged, and be particularly encouraged in times of hardship,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.880]   and that is particularly what I want to address this afternoon.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.640]   I may be the son of scientists, but like I said, I'm no scientist,
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.800]   but I am a pastor.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.560]   I am a pastor, and I am a university president, and so I understand that the
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.080]   workplace can be a hard place.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.440]   Industry can be difficult.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.560]   Even education can have its own challenges.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:34.640]   And there are burdens, and worries, and trials, and perhaps one of the most acute
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.560]   of all of them is loneliness.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.280]   It's loneliness.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.040]   Especially in a discipline which has been overtaken by secularism and paganism,
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.000]   you can really feel isolated.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.660]   You can really feel all alone.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.640]   You are the odd one out.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.040]   You are really different.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.280]   And it may be that you are one of the few in your office, in your department,
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:07.400]   in your group that loves Christ, and you feel like the outlier,
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.960]   and you feel alienated, and you feel like the outcast.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.400]   And as I was praying what to share with you all this afternoon,
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.800]   this idea really came to my mind.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.360]   And it was really accentuated when Tide and A came to our board meeting,
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:28.440]   and she said one of the impetuses behind this symposium is that, she said,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.160]   people sometimes feel like they're all alone, like there's no one who thinks
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.560]   like they do.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.680]   They think, "Does everyone think I'm crazy?
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.520]   Maybe I am crazy."
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.240]   And as she was discussing these things, it really confirmed in my heart what I
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.720]   wanted to share with you all this afternoon.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.760]   In this world, and by the way, it isn't just the scientists,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.040]   it isn't just the specialists that feel this way.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.360]   Even your pastor can feel this way.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.640]   I remember being at Shepard's Conference, and at Shepard's Conference,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.600]   there's about 5,000 pastors who come together, and the singing is tremendous.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.880]   It's loud, it's almost deafening.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.600]   They don't even have to mic the person at the piano, it wouldn't make a difference
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.720]   anyway because they just get drowned out by the men singing.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:27.280]   And I was talking with some pastors on that phenomena, and I asked,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.480]   "Why do you think they sing so loud?"
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.800]   And all of them there, it was about 100 guys, said, "It's easy."
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.720]   Because that time in our year, we realize we're not alone.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:45.040]   We're not the only ones who believe what we believe.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.360]   We're not the only ones preaching from a pulpit, begging people to be a certain way,
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:53.320]   and pleading with them about doctrine, wondering if we're the only ones who do
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.040]   this, or have these kind of struggles, or have these kind of issues.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:03.480]   At that moment, when we're with 5,000 other men, we realize we're not alone.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.120]   Everyone faces this.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.600]   Everyone faces this, and you all face it acutely, I recognize.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:17.560]   And so, what I would like to do is to remind us about how, and what to do,
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:24.200]   and how to think when we face definite loneliness, when we feel the pain
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.880]   of rejection and isolation.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.440]   And at those moments when we're sad, it is not the moment, I recognize,
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.680]   to engage, maybe it is for you, but I don't think normally,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.880]   it's a time where you want to engage in a complex theological proof and discussion,
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.740]   and to remember 57 different things, and to just arrange them all in order.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.480]   At that moment, you just need a phrase.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.640]   You just need a truth to hang on to, one that is rich, one that will minister
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.280]   to your heart, one that you can say quickly, but know with endurance.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.800]   And the Bible gives that to us.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.400]   The Bible has a refrain, and we should memorize it.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.720]   We should memorize it for this afternoon, and carry it with the rest of our lives.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.680]   And it is found in Hebrews 13, 5.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.280]   And it's so simple, you almost don't need me to tell you it.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.800]   You don't even necessarily need to turn your Bible there, although you should,
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.760]   but by the time you turn there, you'll have it memorized.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.920]   You already will know it.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.200]   "I will never leave or desert you.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.040]   I will never forsake you."
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.200]   You know that phrase.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.640]   We say it all the time.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.320]   We say it all over the place.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.240]   We know that.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.440]   It's in the Old Testament.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.720]   It's in the New Testament.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.560]   It's everywhere.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.840]   It's a catchphrase.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.400]   We know that.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.800]   But my goal this afternoon is to make sure we really understand the depths of it,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:59.880]   so that when the trials come and we feel by ourselves that we can say that phrase,
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.840]   and we know exactly what it means, and let the truths therein minister
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.760]   to our soul as it is special revelation.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   So, the text that we're covering is Hebrews 13, verse 5.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.680]   "I will never desert you.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.160]   I will never forsake you."
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.440]   The context of Hebrews is really appropriate to discuss when we're talking
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.200]   about the issue of loneliness.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.880]   And that might sound a little bit odd, but it's actually very,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.720]   very both illuminating and hopefully encouraging.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.840]   Because I think when we think about Hebrews, we often have a superficial
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.120]   understanding of the issues that the people of Hebrews,
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.880]   the audience of Hebrews, face.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.000]   Yes, we know the book of Hebrews is about the supremacy of Christ.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.160]   Yes, we know, perhaps, that Hebrews is not just a letter,
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.320]   but it's a motivational, inspirational, driving sermon and exhortation for people
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.040]   to cling to Christ with loyalty.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.200]   Yes, we know.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.600]   And we know that there is a warning and an urging never to go back to Judaism.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   Yes, we know, and we know that people were tempted to go back there.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.680]   But why was all that happening in one word?
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.560]   It's very simple.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.840]   They were lonely.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.400]   They were lonely.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.480]   Even to this day, in Jewish culture, this is how Christianity is understood.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.080]   I one time was talking with a believer from Judaism, out of Judaism,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.680]   and he's Jewish in ethnicity and background.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:37.160]   And he said to me, "The day I was baptized, my family, not just my immediate family,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.640]   my whole family, extended family, held a funeral for me.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.400]   The very second I was baptized, they knew the minute and hour I was baptized,
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.960]   and they proclaimed me dead."
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:22:00.360]   That is the typical understanding in truly orthodox, to use the term,
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.560]   Jewish families about when someone believes in the Messiah.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.920]   They are dead to us.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.200]   We hold them a funeral.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:15.040]   It's as if they don't exist in our world anymore.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.480]   And what you had with these Jewish believers in the time of the author
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.520]   of Hebrews is a bunch of people who not only were facing the political trials
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   of being Christians, but whose families and friends and lifelong associates had
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.120]   essentially cut them off.
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.160]   They were by themselves.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.360]   And it's hard to be alone.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's hard to be by yourself.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.560]   And that's why in the book of Hebrews, there's exhortations like this.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.200]   Hebrews 3 verse 1, it says this, "Therefore, holy brothers,
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.320]   partakers of a heavenly calling."
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.080]   Why does the author of Hebrews call them brothers?
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.280]   Not just brothers, but holy brothers.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.640]   Why does he remind them?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.440]   You guys are partakers of a heavenly calling.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.280]   It's simple.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.760]   He reminds them, and he's urging them, "Yes, I know.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.720]   You feel like you're gone from your family.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.640]   Yes, I know.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.560]   You feel like you're cut off from your friends.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.440]   Yes, I know.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.960]   You feel like you are disconnected from your community, but you still
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.840]   are holy brothers.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.400]   You have a new family.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.880]   You have a new fellowship.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.320]   You have a new society.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.880]   You have a new friendship and a new reality that links you,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.000]   not just your Jewish heritage, but that you are partakers
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.960]   of a heavenly calling."
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.800]   Why is it that the apostle writing this or exhorting this book has urged
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.960]   about the priesthood of the Lord Jesus Christ, for sure,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.760]   that he is better than Judaism.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:50.240]   But in Hebrews 4, he reminds us, "He will hold you fast.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.360]   You can hold on to your confession.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.240]   You can endure because of his intercession for you.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.640]   You can persevere because he preserves you."
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.800]   Why talk about that?
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.640]   Because the world can be a very lonely place, and you need to know
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.680]   that somebody is on your side, and Jesus is that one.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.440]   And there's no one better than him.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.720]   This is exactly why in Hebrews 10, we are familiar with it,
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:19.280]   "Do not forsake the assembling of one another together."
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.040]   Why?
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   Because that's the only way you can overcome the loneliness of this world.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.720]   Yes, you may feel like it is so lonely out there, and your family has disowned you,
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.560]   and you are completely cut off from everything.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   Well, the solution isn't to go back there.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.880]   The solution is to get into fellowship here.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.760]   That is the author of Hebrews' argument.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.600]   Hebrews 11, why talk about the Hall of Fame of Faith?
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.680]   Because he's reminding his people, "Yes, just like Abraham, you're walking around.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   You're by yourself.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.320]   Just like Moses, you're by yourself.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.040]   Just like Noah, the whole world is against you, minus eight other people.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.440]   But you are all by yourself.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.600]   But the way you please God in the beginning, faith will get you through.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.640]   The way you endure throughout all of that life, in the middle of it,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.480]   just like Abraham had to endure, just like Sarah had to endure,
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.320]   just like Noah had to endure, God will get you through.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.840]   And he will get you through to the end.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.680]   No matter what the challenges are, you will overcome.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.600]   God will get you through, even though you're an exile and sojourner
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.520]   in this world, only seeing the promises from afar.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:34.760]   Hebrews exalts the glory of Christ to people who feel like they're the only one
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.840]   to force them to understand you are never alone.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.120]   You are never alone.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.480]   That's why the church exists and Christ is always with you.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.000]   So there is hope.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.160]   You have not come to a mountain of darkness, as Hebrews 12 says.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.720]   You've come to the mountain of the saints.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.960]   You've come to the mountain of the firstborn of God, that is the Lord Jesus
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.980]   Christ, the preeminent one.
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.600]   You have come to him.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.760]   You are never alone.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.520]   You have the best blessings of all.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.320]   And in this grand presentation of Christ, there are all kinds
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.320]   of applications that can be had.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   You should, of course, know about Christ and his priestly ministry
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.520]   and his glories.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.320]   That's true.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.480]   You can, of course, know him.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.960]   That would be very good.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.640]   And, of course, you can remind yourself of these things and conform yourself
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.400]   to these things.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.000]   That's true too.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.040]   But there are some very practical, very specific actions that the author
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:40.480]   of Hebrews counsels all believers to do, that by doing those rudimentary
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:46.960]   activities, it enforces and implements the entire theology of the book
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.560]   of Hebrews.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.920]   And that's what you have in Hebrews 13.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.000]   If you want the starting steps, the very practical on-the-ground work
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.400]   that can be done and should be done to live out the book of Hebrews,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.320]   you do this.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.520]   Let brotherly love, as it says in verse 1, continue or abide.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.640]   Why?
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.000]   Because if you're loving each other, you'll never be alone.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.240]   And if you love each other with brotherly love, you will provoke each other to love
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.760]   in good deeds and remind each other about the glories of Christ and live that out
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.040]   together and encourage each other in it.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.160]   Let brotherly love continue.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.400]   Show hospitality.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.360]   Don't be neglectful about hospitality.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.640]   Why?
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:34.120]   Because when you feel like a stranger because you're cut off from your family,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.560]   what you need is a new family.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:39.800]   You need somebody to invite you into their home.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.320]   And when you're home with them, you realize, "I'm not alone.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.880]   I'm not cut off.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.080]   I'm not doing Christianity just lone ranger by myself.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.400]   Look at all these people I have with me who love me and care about me and are
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.440]   encouraging me about Christ."
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   And the only reason that you would ever have that kind of relationship with a
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.600]   so-called stranger is simple, because the two strangers know Christ and they're no
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.440]   stranger from each other.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.240]   That's the reason why.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.280]   And so, hospitality, do it.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.600]   If you want to have encouragement, don't neglect and don't forget,
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.720]   but remember those in prison, especially for the faith.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.400]   Why?
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.440]   Because prison can be a very lonely place.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.280]   And so, you don't forget those people either.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.840]   And you have a good marriage, verse 4.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.880]   Why?
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.640]   Because when you've been beaten up by the world, even at work, where do you go?
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.240]   Home.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.160]   And if home is a refuge where Christ is exalted and you see the love of Christ
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.720]   through your spouse, then you are constantly anchored to him there.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.840]   This is practical.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.560]   But all these have been interpersonal.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.920]   Let's talk about a personal one, verse 5.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.880]   At the heart of it all is contentment, that riches, wealth,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.360]   status would never lure you anywhere else.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   And that's the struggle for a lot of the people in the author of Hebrews' time.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.960]   They saw the political safety that Judaism had.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.520]   They saw that there was all the wealth there and all the network and all the
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.040]   connections and all the advancement and all the promotion and all the fame.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   It was there in that culture.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.520]   All the safety and security and prosperity was there.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:32.720]   And your heart could say, "Well, it's just hard to be for Christ because I have to
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.080]   give all of that up."
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.960]   And without contentment, that will always pull you away from the Lord.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   So, what do you have to remember in those moments of loneliness?
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.400]   What do you have to remember in those moments where your heart is struggling
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.280]   with contentment and your heart is struggling to want something it can't
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.080]   have and it shouldn't have?
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.280]   The author of Hebrews says, "This is the key to everything.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.360]   Just tell yourself what God has promised you.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.560]   I will never desert you, nor will I forsake you.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.280]   I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.440]   There are two statements here and there are two points then to this message.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.360]   One, God will never disconnect from you.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.040]   God will never disconnect from you.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:28.240]   God's first promise is this, "I will never."
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.800]   This is the strongest or one of the strongest and most emphatic declarations
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800]   of negation.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.520]   "I will never desert you," or, "I will never leave you."
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.240]   The word "desert" or "leave" here, this first of two phrases,
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   first of two promises, it's not a common verb.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.880]   It's not a common word.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.520]   It actually means to unfasten something, to open something up,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.200]   like when you open up somebody's chain or you loosen a rope.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:06.280]   That's what it's talked about in Acts 16, verse 26, as well as Acts 27, verse 40.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.800]   It's talking about when you cease contact from something or you loosen a connection
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.040]   with something, when something is not tight, when something,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.440]   it has distance, when something is released.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.000]   And since this quote is a quote from the Old Testament, that's what the author
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.200]   of Hebrews is doing here, he's quoting people a promise,
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.400]   Deuteronomy 31, verse 6.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.680]   Then, if you look at the Hebrew word that this is translating,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.000]   it means to become slack.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.880]   It means to become just completely disconnected from somebody.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.520]   And so, negatively, you could think of it this way,
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.200]   that what God is promising here is that he will never disconnect from you.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.320]   He will never lose the closeness he has with you.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.800]   He will never depart from you.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.560]   He will never be physically distant from you.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.160]   He won't let you go.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.960]   He won't be disfellowshipped from you.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.480]   And you say, "Yeah, I understand that."
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.200]   And, of course, what is driving this truth and reality is the doctrine
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.200]   of God's omnipresence.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.720]   And how we think about the doctrine of God's omnipresence,
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.120]   often what we say is, "Well, God's everywhere.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.160]   He's here, He's there, He's over there, and He's next to me.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.040]   Of course, He is because He's everywhere."
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.160]   And that is true.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.600]   That's a good way to think about it.
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.000]   Psalm 139 reminds us, "Where can I go from His presence?"
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.920]   And the answer is nowhere.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.480]   He's always with you.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.320]   That is true.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.720]   But it is healthy not just to think about the doctrine of omnipresence relative
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.400]   to you.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.440]   It is healthy to think about God's omnipresence relative to God.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.040]   Often, how we think about the doctrines of God and the attributes of God is how we
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.160]   are affected by them or how we see them.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.560]   We often don't think about them relative to God.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.960]   Put in scientific terms, please criticize me after this message.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:13.320]   Well, we sometimes critique our fellow man about that they observe things
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.880]   phenomenologically from their perspective, sunrise, sunset.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   But we say, if you look at it from a true angle, a more objective angle,
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.520]   something completely different is happening, something very glorious,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.040]   something amazing, something astounding is happening.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.760]   Yes, what you're seeing is legitimate when you couch it in language of human
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.720]   observation, but you're missing out on something even far grander when you
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.120]   understand it from a different perspective, a more third-party perspective,
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   and not just how you like to see things.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.160]   Well, you can do the same thing with theology.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.760]   Often, when we look at doctrines, we're just looking from our perspective.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.400]   What's God's perspective on this doctrine?
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.320]   And I love this.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:59.520]   The doctrine of omnipresence essentially says this about God, that he is not
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.440]   contingent but absolutely independent spatially.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.120]   That is what it means.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.320]   Omnipresence is the assertion of God's absolute transcendence,
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:17.520]   of God's absolute independence, that God has no need and no reliance
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.400]   on anything for his presence.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.080]   You and I, we rely on things for our presence.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:32.560]   If someone came up to you and said, "Sir, your kids aren't here.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.720]   We can't find them."
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.920]   Your response is, "Normally not."
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.800]   Well, that's okay because they're not contingent on being in a certain place
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.080]   at a certain time.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.120]   It's kind of irrelevant to say that and so I wouldn't worry about it because that's
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.200]   not really a matter of particularity.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.400]   You wouldn't say that.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.120]   You'd say, "That's not good because they got to be somewhere and I need to know
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.880]   where that somewhere is."
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.880]   They're contingent on something.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.640]   It reminds me of one time there was a negotiation between Israel and the Arab
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.240]   nations and the Arab nation says, "We are totally okay with the existence
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.280]   of Israel."
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.520]   And everyone said, "That's great, as long as it's not on a map."
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.000]   How do you exist as a nation if it's not on a map?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.520]   How do you exist as a nation without a land to exist on?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:27.160]   Things are contingent, our presence, our existence is contingent on physical
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.560]   locationality in this world.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.480]   We are contingent and reliant and dependent and predicated upon things.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.280]   God is not.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.600]   God has never been predicated upon space or time.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:46.760]   He has never been relying on something to anchor His existence.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.160]   He is completely autonomous above and beyond all of that.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.640]   That is God.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   That is why He is not a man.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.680]   That is why He is not creation.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.200]   And there are so many passages that celebrate this.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.400]   It is Psalm 23, "Even though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.360]   you are what?
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.120]   With me."
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:08.880]   Why?
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.520]   Because it doesn't matter the space or the time, God is there.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.680]   It is not contingent on, "Well, this is a pretty hard place to get to,
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.480]   so I don't know if God can be with me."
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.000]   That is irrelevant to God.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.720]   There is no such thing as hard or easy space because you're not confined by space
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.880]   to begin with.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.080]   It is the glory of God to be with you because it demonstrates that He was never
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.760]   dependent on any of those factors to begin with.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.520]   They never hindered or factored into Him whatsoever.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.600]   Likewise, Ezekiel 1.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.160]   Ezekiel 1 depicts God in this divine chariot throne.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.360]   In fact, the very chariot itself symbolizes creation.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.080]   You can even see it.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.960]   There's a wheel within a wheel, like a sphere, like a globe.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.480]   And then on top of that, it says this, that there was a firmament.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.560]   Where have we heard the term firmament?
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.040]   Genesis 1.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.360]   It is as if you can see the world, the sphere of the wheel within the wheel,
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.840]   and the firmament on top of that, and then the glory of God on top of that
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.800]   in this divine chariot.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.920]   It's a symbol.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:20.280]   The divine chariot itself is a symbol that God's presence is everywhere.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.600]   His glory fills the whole world.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.320]   And therefore, just like a chariot is mobile and a chariot that has spherical
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.520]   wheels is the most mobile because you don't even have to turn the wheels like
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.960]   you do in a car, God's presence is unhindered.
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.400]   It goes everywhere and anywhere without any problem because it was never
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.840]   contingent on anything for its physical locationality to begin with.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.080]   That is the presence of God.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:53.200]   He is strong, stronger, and nothing binds Him because He is omnipresent.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.480]   And you might say, "Okay, I understand that God is everywhere.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:03.520]   I understand that He is with me, but it's really hard because I don't see Him."
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:11.040]   But remember this, His presence is not conditioned or contingent on anything.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:16.600]   It's not even conditioned or contingent on His visibility.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.920]   That's the point.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.560]   You don't have to see Him for Him to be there.
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.160]   It's not a prerequisite for you to see Him for Him to be there.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   He is there because He's not contingent on anything.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:39.360]   No factor disqualifies or could ever preclude God from being present because
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.680]   He's omnipresent and inherently transcends all of those things.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:50.440]   And so, at any place, any situation, any trial, any hard moment,
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.760]   God has never left you.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.960]   He has never deserted you.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.480]   He has always been there.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.120]   He has never disconnected Himself from you.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.800]   That's to put it negatively.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.640]   But there's another way to describe this, and we could describe it positively.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.960]   Positively.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.720]   If He's not deserted you, if He's not slack, if He's not loose,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.080]   if He's not disaffiliated, then what is He?
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.560]   He's not just by your side.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.600]   He's not just nearby.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.240]   Sometimes, I tell students, and I think we tell each other, "Hey, hey,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.880]   I'm not that far away.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.080]   You just text me and I'll be there."
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.960]   "Oh, I'm not that far away.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.440]   You just give me a call and we'll be right there."
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:44.320]   And our definition of not far away or really being close is just accessibility.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.240]   It's just convenience.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:52.320]   And that's good for human beings who are bound by space and time, I recognize.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.080]   But here's the glory of God.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.600]   It's not just that He's present.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.480]   He's tight and close to you.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.280]   That's why the text says, "He does not loosen Himself from you."
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.120]   What does that mean?
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.480]   He's just right there.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   He's not just nearby.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.160]   He's not just close by.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:17.120]   He's right intimately in you and in your situation.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.720]   He's not just a prayer away.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.480]   He's there.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.120]   He's there.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.480]   That's what's so powerful about this.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.520]   Think of it this way.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.600]   Psalm 46, I think we're very familiar with it, "A mighty fortress is our God."
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   We know that.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.360]   And then the next phrase is, "An ever-present help in trouble."
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.560]   Do you know what the word ever-present means?
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.960]   It means always found.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.040]   That's what it means in Hebrew, always found.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.800]   But it's very hard to translate always found help.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.600]   What does that even mean?
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.520]   So we just translate it ever-present.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.400]   But it really, in Hebrew, means always found.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400]   Why?
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.160]   Because in our minds sometimes, when we are in trouble, when we're going
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.240]   through a situation, when we feel by ourselves, when we feel threatened,
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.080]   we feel like we have to find God.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.920]   Where did he go?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.600]   Where is he in this situation?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.080]   I got to go search for him.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.440]   I got to go seek him out.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.160]   What does God say?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.520]   "I never deserted you.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.000]   I never left you.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.400]   I'm right there.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.840]   I'm always found.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.200]   You never need to find me.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.560]   I'm always found.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.000]   I'm right there.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.800]   I'm not a phone call away where you have to then give a report, like to your boss,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.280]   about what's going on and kind of help him to understand the situation.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.840]   He's in the situation.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.560]   He knows it better than you do.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   He's right there.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.520]   You don't have to go looking for him.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:42.680]   He's found."
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.280]   In fact, it goes to this point.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.720]   This is amazing.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.920]   In Psalm 73, verse 23.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.800]   Psalm 73, verse 23, it says this, and listen to the words carefully.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.080]   "I found.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.720]   I am with you.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.480]   I am with you."
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.680]   Listen to those words for a second and think about it this way.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.960]   Often, what we say to God is, "You are with me."
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.040]   That's how we often think about it.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.120]   God's with us.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:16.800]   God's with us.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   And that's a biblical phrase, and that's a biblical truth.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.840]   Amen and amen.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.640]   God is with us.
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.800]   And the presumption that goes along with this is that we're meandering throughout
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.520]   our lives and going about our jolly business, and God is right by our side.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.920]   He's hugging very tightly close to us, and that's true.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.000]   But what does a psalmist realize in Psalm 73?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.080]   That we are so close to God, and God is so close to us.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.120]   It's not that he is with us.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:46.400]   We are actually what?
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.760]   With him.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.300]   This whole time, you have thought that you are going along your life,
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:57.720]   meandering down the ways and the path of this existence, and then God is just
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.280]   tagging along with you, supporting you as you go.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.000]   And there is a truth to that, but the real truth, if you're looking at it
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.800]   from a third-party, omnipresent perspective, is this.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.560]   God was actually leading you the entire time.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.480]   He was the one cutting the path forward.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.760]   He was the one driving through every single trial.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.520]   And it wasn't that he was with you.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:25.080]   It was that you were alongside of him for the ride.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.840]   That's how close he was with you.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:34.120]   He was holding your hand and dragging you through, not the other way around.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.440]   That is the God who never deserts us.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.080]   That's how close he is.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.120]   When God says, "I will not desert you," it's a promise that he will never slacken.
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.760]   He will never loosen.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.520]   He will never create distance.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.140]   He will not disconnect.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.000]   But rather, he will always be in the closest, most intimate,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.040]   most involved position with you.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.840]   He, and when you have trouble, and when you have trial, you don't need
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.800]   to search for him.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:04.760]   He's found.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.160]   And when you feel isolated in work, or at school, or in industry,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.320]   you don't need to go to meet him.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.880]   You don't need to go anywhere.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.120]   He's there.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:19.240]   And when you are hurt, and when you are rejected, and you are wondering,
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.800]   "Does anyone understand what I'm going through?"
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:22.600]   God does.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.160]   Why?
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.480]   Because he's there.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.520]   He's right there in the situation.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.640]   He has not deserted you in that moment.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.720]   He's right there.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.200]   He is not spatially bound.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.880]   And if you say, "Okay, I understand that, but I just can't see him,
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.560]   and I struggle with that."
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.520]   Remember this, you may not be able to see him, but that doesn't mean he's
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:48.520]   not there because that he was never contingent on that visibility
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.800]   to begin with.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.480]   He will never desert you.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.840]   He's right there.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.160]   He's always found.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:58.520]   It's not that he's with you, you're with him.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   That's what's going on.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:08.720]   Second, God is not just not disconnected, he is not distant from us.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.480]   Notice the last phrase, equally emphatic, "I will never,
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.680]   it will never happen.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.560]   I will never forsake you."
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.960]   Sometimes loneliness is not just a physical reality, just being physically
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:33.080]   by yourself or physically isolated or quarantined, it's relational.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.160]   You know, you can be in a room filled with people but be alone.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.120]   You can be in a room with all your colleagues but be completely rejected.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.080]   And probably some of you here have experienced that.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.840]   People can shun you, people can mock you, people can feel uncomfortable
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.600]   around you, people want to distance themselves from you.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:57.800]   And even though they're right next to you, you can be all alone.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.760]   And that perhaps is even more hurtful than sometimes being physically
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:05.960]   by yourself and wondering if there's anyone out there.
[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.840]   Because when you're physically by yourself, nothing is happening.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:13.360]   There's no one around to do anything to you.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:18.320]   But when people are there and they're proactively rejecting you,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.080]   that's when it hurts the most.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.840]   And here is exactly what was happening to the people in the author
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.000]   of Hebrews Day.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.720]   They had people around them all the time.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.360]   They were presumably in the city of Rome, but they were all by themselves.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   They were all by themselves.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.520]   And so what does the author of Hebrews do?
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.480]   In the final chapter, he reminds them of this promise,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.160]   "God never has ever forsaken you."
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.320]   Here's the idea.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:57.360]   There's never been a point for the believer, for the one who knows Christ,
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.960]   where God has not only just disconnected from them physically but shunned them.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.080]   He has never closed the door on them.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.480]   He has never turned a cold shoulder on them.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.640]   He has never rejected them.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.280]   He has never just had enough and doesn't want to listen anymore,
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.880]   and just completely distanced himself from them.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.600]   No, rather, what is it?
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.040]   It's the opposite of that.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   God has always embraced his children.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.440]   He has always been near to them.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.800]   He has always warmly hugged them.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.560]   He has always warmly loved them.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:39.400]   He has always been intimately related and connected with them.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:47.200]   And even in discipline, even in discipline, he still shows that care.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.200]   You know, as an educator, sometimes you just feel like you can never win.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   If you grade your students harshly, then they say, "The teacher's too harsh.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.800]   Writes too much.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.560]   Tell him to slacken off a little bit."
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.760]   So then you abide by their instructions, and then you don't say a thing.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   And what do they say in their reviews?
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.160]   "The teacher seems very disinvolved with the students, doesn't pay attention,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.360]   doesn't participate enough in their lives.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.040]   We need some more critique.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.800]   We need some more rebuke."
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.400]   Which one is it?
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.800]   But that's the point.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:30.240]   Even when we're rebuked, even when we're disciplined, it's because a God is there,
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.360]   not because he's not.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.440]   It's because God has not shunned his children.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.920]   He's there.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.520]   He's there, still holding on.
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.800]   He's there, still embracing.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.400]   He's there, loving, and understanding, and caring about you as his child,
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.200]   as his adopted son, as his heir.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.800]   You can always have comfort.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.840]   Even when everyone is ridiculing you, and you feel completely misunderstood,
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.280]   and they don't understand where I'm coming from, and they don't get me,
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.400]   there is one who always does, and that's your God.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.480]   He perfectly does.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.240]   And he is right there, and he is right there, and therefore,
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.480]   understands everything completely in that second.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:21.440]   And as we go to him in prayer and seek solace in him, you will always have it.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.360]   Why?
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.040]   Because he will never forsake us.
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:31.080]   There is no distance between us and God ever, relationally.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:37.040]   But if that's not enough, if you just can't seem to grasp and have our hearts
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.720]   compelled by this truth that God always embraces us, and always keeps us close,
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:48.760]   and always relationally understands, and he is our sympathetic high priest who is
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.160]   not just understanding, but interceding so that we persevere to the end.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.920]   And if that just doesn't grip our heart, remember why God will never forsake us.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.680]   Remember why God will never forsake us.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.240]   You see, Hebrews 13, 5, like I've been saying, is a quote from the Old Testament.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.440]   And it is a quote from the Old Testament, and the Hebrew word "forsake" is found
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.120]   in other very, very key passages.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.200]   You know of one of them, Psalm 22, verse 1.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:22.960]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.200]   There's a reason why God will never forsake you.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:35.440]   The reason is this, because he forsook his son.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:43.560]   The reason God will never forsake you is because there was one who took your place.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:46.080]   Do we deserve to be forsaken?
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.000]   Absolutely.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.760]   Do we deserve rejection and the worst kind of repudiation, and humiliation,
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.680]   and wrath?
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.080]   Of course we do.
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:02.160]   Do we deserve the worst kind of punishment, and the worst kind of alienation,
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.560]   and the worst kind of despising that we could ever receive?
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.000]   Of course we do.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.400]   But why don't we have it?
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.640]   Why do we have the complete opposite?
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:16.000]   It's because there was one, in space and time, that was forsaken.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.920]   And it was not us, but our substitute, the Son of God.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.040]   And he was forsaken on our behalf.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:30.840]   He, in his humanity, was rejected by the triune God, and by God the Father,
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.640]   and poured out his wrath on him, absorbed the penalty for us,
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.280]   so to speak, took our place.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   And all of that happened so that we would never, never, ever in our life,
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.520]   in our entire existence, face what it really means to be forsaken.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.240]   It will never happen because someone took our place.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.920]   And in the times when you wonder, because you're hurting so badly,
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.080]   or you feel so poorly, "Does God still really love me?
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.640]   Does God even care about what is going on?"
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.040]   Remember this.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.280]   Yes, he does.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:05.960]   Why?
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   Because someone already took our place to secure that for forever.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.240]   That we would never face that.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.760]   And in the moments when we're skeptical about how deep that love could be,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.680]   and how intimate that care, and compassion, and sympathy is,
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.600]   just remember what God has communicated here through the wordplay of the text.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.040]   He says this, "I gave up my son for you.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.080]   I forsook my son for you.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:37.160]   Do you really think that I would forsake you when I could give up and I did not
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.040]   spare my only son?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.720]   Of course, I care about you.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.400]   Of course, I love you."
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.200]   Remember that.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.480]   Remember that.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:56.200]   We will never, ever be forsaken because someone took our place and was that for us.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.480]   So, God says, "I will never desert you.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.960]   I will never leave you nor forsake you."
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.360]   He's not disconnected.
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:10.640]   He's not distant from us because he's always right there.
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.400]   He's ever found.
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:20.320]   And he cannot disconnect from us because his son took that on our behalf.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:27.800]   And when you feel alone, and when you feel rejected, tell yourself that phrase,
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:29.920]   and that'll carry you home.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.640]   You see, you might say, "How do I know that that's true?"
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.520]   Remember, this is an Old Testament quote.
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:41.240]   It's first found in Deuteronomy 31, where Moses told that to Israel,
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.920]   and Moses told it to Joshua.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:49.520]   And then, it's found again in Joshua, where God told that to Joshua to tell
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   to the people of Israel.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:56.400]   And then, it's found again in 1 Chronicles 28, verse 20,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.240]   where David is telling that to Solomon.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.680]   What you start to see is that every generation tells that truth to the next
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:08.160]   generation, which tells that truth to the next generation, which has told that truth
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.880]   to the next generation, which has told that truth to the following generation.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:16.640]   And so, the author of Hebrews here, he said, "Don't forget what your parents
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.840]   told you.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:22.600]   Don't forget what was true throughout all history, not just in your lifetime,
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.120]   not just in your parents' lifetime, not just in your grandparents' lifetime.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.240]   It's the only reason why you exist.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.080]   It's the only reason why history has flowed the way it's flowed.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:36.040]   It's because of this truth, because God has never left you,
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.400]   nor will he ever forsake you.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.440]   That's why you exist now.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.180]   That's why history is the way it is.
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:50.880]   There is a history, a history of proof that this is the truth.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.200]   The author of Hebrews reminds us, "Don't go by just what you feel.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.360]   Never go by what you feel.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.120]   Go by what is true, what has always been true."
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.320]   And with that, God is always with us.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.760]   He's always found.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.400]   He's never disconnected.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.600]   He's never distant.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.500]   And you may feel the acute pain of loneliness and rejection.
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.700]   It comes with being in this world where we are sojourners and exiles.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.380]   But just remember, our God never deserted us.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.720]   Our God never forsook us.
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:31.140]   In fact, what he did instead is he forsook his own son so that we would never,
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.180]   ever be forsaken.
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:39.500]   And that's how much, that's how great God loves his children,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:44.060]   how much he loves us, how much he is with us.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:53.140]   In fact, truly, in the end, he is so with us that we are, in fact, not we are,
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.260]   God is with us, but we are with him.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.320]   you
