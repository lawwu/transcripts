[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.780]   So you're adequate to cover yourself when it's cold.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:26.380]   Or if you don't have something built in, you are in an enclosed space that's small enough,
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.380]   has a little bit better insulation than most tents,
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.480]   so you can just use some kind of portable heater inside of the camper.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.880]   So these, so a tent, a pop-up camper offers all of the basic amenities.

Other big, big benefits of a pop-up camper, though. A pop-up camper is easy to tow, probably with the vehicle that you have. And when you're towing, the boys, you're needing to buy another vehicle, a special vehicle, and it's not as tiring to have it. When I bought a travel trailer, I bought a travel

He said that it would be really simple and nimble and he would drive me to Texas and that way I wouldn't have to bother with the hotel. I can just camp along the way. It would just be me traveling. It would be really wonderful."
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:59.100]   It was work. I very, I did use it a couple of times. But it was big. It was thirsty. And it was work to drive it. And I got to the point where I realized that even though I had this nice RV and I had all the stuff in it. I had all the amenities.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   It was an RV. It was a comfortable bed. I would just assume either just stay in the hotel, drive a car or fly and stay in the hotel like normal people do. Or just stay in my minivan. More comfortable and easier to drive. And if I'm going to go a thousand miles, it's just a lot less work and a lot cheaper to drive a minivan than drive this Class B RV.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:56.980]  , but it was no big deal. I'm good at driving it. I'm good at backing it, etc. But when I had it, I never took it on any short term trips. But it was such a hassle to hook the thing up and to deal with where am I going to park it, etc. I didn't think I would ever use it for a short term trip. It wasn't the kind of thing where I would use it for a quick weekend getaway. Just too much of a hassle. I wouldn't want to drag it to North Carolina. North Carolina is not that far away, but it would just be a hassle for me to drag it to North Carolina.

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   It has to do with wind resistance.

[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   How tall is that trailer?
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   You could tow a fairly heavy trailer. Once you get it going, as long as you don't have a ton of wind resistance, you can drive it pretty fast, but if you have a big tall trailer that sticks up high above your vehicle, that wind resistance does a lot of damage to your driveline. Cheap to add on to the things that you already have. Big benefit of pop-up champer is it's cheap to pull. You have a radically cheap
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   pump that you need to use.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   It's cheap to pull.

[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   It's cheap to pull. It's cheaper to pull. It's probably useful. It means you'll use it more. It makes it easier to drive, like I said earlier, but it also makes it cheaper to drive. It's frustrating to think about heading across the country at 8 miles per gallon, but if you take an average vehicle and I'm guessing here, it's a little bit of educated guessing, but I have never taken a separate estimate of the car, but I'm not going to take a separate estimate of the car.

[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   Fifth wheel, same thing. For full timing, fifth wheel would be awesome. Is there a weekend here or there to tow that big old thing and deal with it?
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   It's just a pain. And again, I had to keep it big and small.

[00:46:48.140 --> 00:47:18.160]   the big truck around 8 10 miles per gallon travel trailer fine but basically the same problem as a fifth wheel it's a hassle like I described earlier what about a small travel trailer well for me I don't really fit well in a small travel trailer shoulder too big too tall etc and they're not enough beds for my family really usually two people fit well and some of the kind of the small travel trailers and I don't see the point that bathrooms are uncomfortable they're too small I don't want to use the shower I don't use the TV so

[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:43.160]   ISSUE 3: THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING PURCHASING AN RV OF SOME KIND. WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO, AS WITH ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE IS RENT. RENT SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND TRY THEM OUT. IT'S FAIRLY EASY IN MOST PLACES TO RENT A POP-UP CAMPER. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND ONE. WE TOOK A RENTAL POP-UP CAMPER FROM FLORIDA TO THE GRAND CANYON ONE TIME AND IT WORKED FINE. SO YOU CAN RENT ONE, TRY IT OUT THAT WAY. RENT A FEW DIFFERENT TRAVEL TRAILERS AND RENT A BIG TRAVEL TRAILER FROM THE GRAND CANYON. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN DO.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:53:13.180]  , RENT A BIG MOTORHOME IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING THAT DIRECTION. THERE'S BEEN SUCH A PROLIFERATION IN THE RENTAL MARKETPLACE THAT NOW YOU CAN FIND ALMOST ANYTHING TO RENT. DON'T THINK THAT IT'S EXPENSIVE TO RENT A CAMPER AND YOU'LL JUST SAVE MONEY BY BUYING ONE. YOU WILL NOT. IT'S NOT EXPENSIVE TO RENT A CAMPER. IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING ONE. YOU WON'T KNOW TODAY IF YOU'VE NEVER OWNED ONE, YOU WON'T KNOW ALL THE LITTLE EXPENSES THAT ADD UP, BUT YOU'LL KNOW THAT YOU CAN RENT A CAMPER.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:27.660]   BUT IT'S CHEAPER TO RENT IT, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY YOU SHOULD RENT IT ANYWAY. YOU SHOULD JUST DISPENSE WITH BUYING IT IN THE LONG RUN. USUALLY THERE YOU GET INTO JUST HOW MANY NIGHTS YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO USE IT AND THEN AVAILABILITY, ETC.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:43.200]   I WILL FULLY CONCEIVE THE POINT ABOUT POP-UP CAMPERS NOT BEING ABLE JUST TO GET IN AND HAVE A MEAL. AND THAT IS ONE THING THAT'S LOVELY ABOUT A FIXED TRAILER, FIXED MOTORHOME, ETC.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:43.200]   I WILL FULLY CONCEIVE THE POINT ABOUT POP-UP CAMPERS NOT BEING ABLE JUST TO GET IN AND HAVE A MEAL.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:54:13.220]  ,
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   SOMETHING THAT I'VE GOT TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   I HOPE THAT WAS A GOOD USEFUL THING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   JUST ALWAYS BE CAREFUL.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS POSSIBLE.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   MANY PEOPLE LOSE A LOT OF MONEY ON RVS AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   IF YOU'RE CAREFUL AND IF YOU'RE PATIENT AND IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME YOU CAN DO OKAY.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:43.240]   I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS POSSIBLE.
