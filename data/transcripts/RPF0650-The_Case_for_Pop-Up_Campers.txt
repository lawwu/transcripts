[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.040]   Today on the show, we're gonna talk about camping.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.000]   (laughs)
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.140]   Years ago, when I was in the,
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.180]   briefly in the marketing and brand management
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.380]   consulting business, I learned something
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.680]   from a senior marketing consultant who said to me,
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.720]   "Joshua, don't ever put anything camping related
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.660]   in any kind of marketing thing that you do."
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660]   He said, "Don't ever use pictures of camping.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.800]   Don't use pictures of families camping, et cetera."
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   I said, "It's the kiss of death when it comes to marketing."
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.400]   Lots of people say they like camping,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940]   but in reality, nobody likes it.
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.040]   (laughs)
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.780]   So I never did.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.940]   Now, I don't know if they were right.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.000]   I assume they were right,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.780]   but the RV industry is certainly healthy today,
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.980]   and the camping industry certainly seems fairly healthy.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.160]   And for me, camping is something
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.260]   that I've always enjoyed doing,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.880]   which I'll tell you about in a while.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.700]   And in this show, I'm gonna fulfill a long-awaited promise
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.760]   that I'll tell you why I believe a pop-up trailer
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.000]   or a pop-up tent camper is the ideal solution
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200]   for family camping.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.380]   Now, you need to know what makes this such an important show
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.140]   is when I was younger, I promised myself
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.680]   I would never have a pop-up camper
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.180]   because I hated them.
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.720]   And I'll tell you why my opinion has changed
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.680]   since I've tried a number of different kinds of RVs.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.860]   Bit of backstory wheel service
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.320]   is a good foundation for this
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.620]   as far as my own personal experience.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.920]   I grew up, when I was growing up,
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.160]   for our family vacations,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.640]   we frequently took family vacations
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.900]   using a pop-up tent camper.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.400]   My dad had bought, he said he'd paid $500
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.640]   for this old piece of junk pop-up camper,
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.580]   and we took that thing all across the United States.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.880]   We went from South Florida up as far north as Northern Maine.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.180]   I think we went to Canada one time,
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.520]   but I don't remember that trip.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.620]   We went out to the West.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.620]   We went to Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Montana,
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.160]   all over the country with a pop-up tent camper,
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.120]   both with the cheap one,
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.960]   and then later at a later time,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.140]   we rented a pop-up tent camper to use as well
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.540]   on a camping trip that we took.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.040]   And so I grew up camping in a pop-up camper,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.640]   and it was a wonderful way for my family and me
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.840]   to see the country.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.880]   I saw my parents really tried to make sure,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.920]   worked hard to make sure that they showed us the country,
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   showed us what was available,
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.360]   so we just didn't live in one town
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.400]   and didn't have an idea of what the world contained.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   They worked hard to do that,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.100]   and I'm really grateful for them.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.840]   Because of that, I have an intense emotional connection
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.500]   with the topic of camping.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.240]   I have this intense affinity for almost anything
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.740]   campground-related, travel-related, et cetera.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.580]   Even to this day, I love campgrounds.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.040]   I like going across the country.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.380]   I like interstate highway.
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.480]   I like driving.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.580]   I don't get tired of it.
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.620]   I have this intense emotional connection to camping.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.460]   I should specify that I mean car camping,
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.660]   not backpacking out in the wilderness.
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.400]   I admire that, but I've never had the chance
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.020]   to do that kind of camping.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.660]   So all of my experience has been car camping.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.160]   So because this is such an emotional issue for me,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640]   it's something that I have thought a lot about.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.900]   When I was growing up, I did not like our pop-up camper,
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.980]   and I'll tell you why.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.840]   The reason was that I didn't like
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.720]   putting the top up and down.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.620]   We had an old pop-up that generally worked,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.880]   except the handle that was easy to access
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.980]   to turn the crank, that crank was broken.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.200]   So we had to crank it at this very awkward place
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.800]   on the camper in order to pop the top up and down.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.000]   The other thing I didn't like about it,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.660]   it seemed like it was always getting wet inside.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.960]   Now I understand that it was because I had old canvas,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.140]   and the canvas would leak, and the beds would get wet.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.700]   And then what was worse is the girls and my parents
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.300]   got to sleep inside the pop-up camper,
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.080]   but the boys always slept in a tent out on the side,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.620]   'cause we were too many to comfortably fit
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.840]   in the pop-up camper.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.320]   So we slept in the tent, and I'd always,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.420]   I just remember waking up with a wet sleeping bag
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.520]   in the tent, so I didn't have great experiences.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.380]   And I would always look longingly in the campground
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.160]   at the big, fancy RVs, and I would just think
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.360]   how nice it would be if we had one of those.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.600]   And we never had one of those.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.920]   And so I said, I'm not gonna have a pop-up camper,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.200]   I'm gonna have an RV.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.100]   So from the time before I was a teenager,
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.200]   I always thought about RVs, I always was obsessed with them,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.640]   I looked into them, et cetera.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640]   And at this point, I've now owned two RVs.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.920]   My first RV was a Class B road-trek van camper,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.600]   which my wife and I really enjoyed
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.980]   in the time that we owned it,
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.800]   but then we outgrew it with the number of children
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.680]   that we had, we just couldn't fit in it anymore.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.740]   And I bought a travel trailer, and last year,
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.440]   my wife and I full-timed all around the United States
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.960]   for about six months, I think 13, 15,000 miles,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.720]   something like that, all around the country,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.960]   and we had a great time.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.320]   And for that, I had bought a 30-foot travel trailer
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.680]   with a bunkhouse for the children, and we really enjoyed it.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.480]   But that process taught me a lot,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.600]   because in owning the travel trailer,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.820]   I learned some lessons that I don't think
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.220]   I would've been able to learn from someone else.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.720]   I had to do it myself.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   And what I learned was, I didn't like
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.520]   having the travel trailer as much as I thought I would.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.000]   And I realized that I would rather
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.760]   have a different type of RV.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.240]   Now, this is normal.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.540]   Generally, you should know that most people
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.060]   who get into RVs usually go through a few different RVs
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.720]   until they figure out what they actually like.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.960]   Some people try RVing and don't like it and get out.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.000]   Some people have to try a couple of different things,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.440]   and some people start with a pop-up
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.720]   and wind up with a big motorhome,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.760]   some people start with a motorhome
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.820]   and wind up with a truck camper.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.180]   I mean, it's all over the place.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.200]   So expect, if you've never done this,
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.360]   expect that you're probably gonna have to try
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.120]   a few different rigs until you figure out what you like.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.480]   And by the way, this is why you should be very careful
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.280]   financially along the way.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.960]   I have, I guess technically I've owned three RVs,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   'cause I also bought a truck camper.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040]   But so, yeah, I guess I should say that.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.440]   I've owned three RVs.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.900]   And along the way, I've been able to get into them
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.280]   and out of them without really losing any money.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.080]   In fact, I just recently finally sold
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.520]   the last pickup truck that I own
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.040]   from the recent, from all of my full-time RV days.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.000]   And for context, I bought a van, then I bought a truck,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.320]   then the truck got stolen, and I bought another truck,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.080]   and I bought a camper, and then I bought a truck camper.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.100]   And then systematically I sold all those things.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.040]   I just did my accounting,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   and I was able to come out of the whole saga.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.760]   If I exclude the van, I was able to come out
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.320]   of the whole saga completely whole,
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.040]   where I didn't lose any money,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.600]   even with all of the money that I spent
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.160]   on trucks and campers, et cetera.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.560]   I came out completely whole.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.500]   If I include the van, that was my big mistake,
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.720]   was my big 15-passenger van that I bought.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.880]   Then I lost about $2,000 total
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.640]   on a total of three vehicles and two RVs.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.540]   So you can do it, and I would encourage you,
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.620]   be careful on your way through.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.280]   Be careful when you buy, and go in slow,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.320]   prepare to take your time,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.360]   don't spend money you can't afford to lose, et cetera.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.560]   Stay out of the new place,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.400]   although actually that's a subject for a different day.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.520]   I'm not as opposed to new RVs as I once was.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.180]   I wasn't sure if I would get out healthy
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.500]   from all of my different deals,
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.760]   but thankfully I was able to get out of them
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.800]   without losing a bunch of money.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.280]   So you're gonna have to try a few different things,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.360]   and my idea in this show is to help you
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.200]   to learn from my experience as to why I think
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.320]   that a pop-up trailer is the ideal solution
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.160]   for most families in their camping endeavors.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.680]   Everything in RVing is a matter of trade-offs.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.800]   We are in kind of a golden age of RV choices
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.880]   where there are so many wonderful designs.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.560]   You can find something that will fit
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.380]   anything you're looking for,
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.240]   but these are all a matter of trade-offs.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.800]   They're a matter of comfort compared to convenience,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.760]   and size, and cost, and just tons of trade-offs.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.520]   So you're gonna gain certain things
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.500]   and give up certain things,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.800]   and you're gonna have to judge what's important to you
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.600]   based upon your goals.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   For clarity, I would not choose a pop-up
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.200]   for full-time living.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.620]   I would not choose it for that,
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.360]   and that's why I did not choose one.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.680]   You need to be able to be indoors more comfortably
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.340]   if you're full-timing on the road or taking extended trips.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.480]   Pop-ups, I don't think, are good for that.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.440]   But I do think that a pop-up is the ideal
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.200]   solution for what I'd call normal family use of a camper.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   And what I'm saying is,
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.080]   two to three to four weeks per year,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.840]   family vacations in national parks,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.700]   covering the country, touring around,
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.200]   a few weekends here and there,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.900]   I think a pop-up is an ideal solution for that.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.960]   Let me explain why.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.320]   So what's the problem with camping?
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.040]   Well, let's assume that you would like
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.380]   to have a bit more comfort and a bit less hassle
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.040]   than you can get with tent camping out of your car.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.080]   Tent camping is the easiest way to get into camping.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.480]   It's the cheapest way, and it's very, very flexible.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.400]   And tent camping is, in many ways,
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.120]   the best solution if you're going
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.320]   to be off of the beaten path.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.040]   For example, if you wanna just drive out into the desert
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.080]   and camp out in the middle of the desert,
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.320]   a tent is a great way to do it.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.600]   You got a four-wheel drive vehicle,
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.720]   you toss a tent in the back, you drive out in the desert,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.560]   you set up your tent, you're good to go.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.400]   A tent is certainly the best solution
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.520]   for somebody who's gonna backpack into a place
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.400]   where there are no roads and get off the beaten path.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.600]   That is what tent camping is great at.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.720]   But if you are doing car camping,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.600]   going to state parks, national parks, et cetera,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   tent camping isn't great in the United States
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.300]   in that context.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.000]   My biggest frustration with tent camping
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.680]   in that context is that it's dirty.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.920]   Everything is dirty.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.080]   All the campgrounds, usually there's just dirt all around,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   which they can't help it.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.520]   There's a lot of wear and tear.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   If you're up in a beautiful mountain meadow,
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   you can put your tent down on a nice lush green meadow
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.760]   and you won't get dirty.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.680]   But when you go into your local state park,
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.960]   there's gonna be dirt all around
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   and you track it in and out of the tent
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.560]   and it gets in your bedding and it gets on everything
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.200]   and your kids get filthy, et cetera.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.880]   It's just dirty.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.560]   Tent camping is a hassle because you're on the ground
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.360]   and that mountain meadow works really well
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.520]   with your thermo rest spread across it.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.200]   But when you're in the little piddly tent pad
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.000]   that's covered with gravel at your local state park,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.520]   you're tearing up your tent,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.160]   terribly uncomfortable for you.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.680]   You gotta put down all this extra stuff
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.000]   to make it comfortable and it's just a pain.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.560]   And then tent camping generally means
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.640]   that you gotta, in addition to a tent,
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.940]   if you're actually gonna be out there
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.460]   for anything more than sleeping,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.220]   you're probably gonna set up other stuff.
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.400]   You're gonna set up some kind of tarp or canopy
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.280]   so that you can have some place to cook under.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.360]   You're gonna set up a table.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.240]   You're gonna set up a kitchen.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.760]   You're gonna set up all this gear.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.800]   And that stuff takes time.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   It takes time to set it up, takes time to haul it.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.240]   It's just kind of a hassle.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   So let's assume that you wanna be a bit more comfort
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.320]   and a bit less hassle than you can get with tent camping.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.360]   You wanna be out of the dirt.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.860]   You wanna be off the ground.
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.620]   You wanna be able to be out of the elements,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.240]   out of the heat, out of the cold,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.360]   out of the rain with a little bit of comfort.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.120]   And then you'd like to be able to have a faster
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.740]   and simpler setup of your camp
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.820]   and a faster and simpler teardown of your camp.
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.240]   You don't wanna set up a tent, then set up a tarp,
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.680]   set up a table, set up a stove,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.200]   and do all those things a little bit faster.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.320]   Let's assume also that you're more than two people
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.740]   because if you're only one or two people,
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.240]   I think your best bet there is to be very flexible
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.720]   and enjoy your small size.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.680]   I think truck campers are a wonderful way to go.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.940]   The small, hard-sided trailers,
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.180]   the little fiberglass egg trailers type of thing,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.360]   or very small travel trailers are great if you're two people.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   But if you're more than that,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.960]   it becomes a little bit more challenging.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.400]   Where do the beds go?
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.520]   And then again, I'm tailoring this
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.440]   for a US-American context.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.720]   So assume you want something a little bit better than that,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.240]   but then assume that you don't really wanna go up
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.440]   to the big options because yes, you could get a tent,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.760]   but you were gonna assume you're not gonna go ahead
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.800]   and go for a big luxury motorhome,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.760]   a $100,000 RV of some kind.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.280]   So you're looking for something in the middle.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.960]   Well, basically you'll look at, in that scenario,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.900]   look at something like a travel trailer,
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.080]   a medium-sized travel trailer,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.120]   a large travel trailer, 20 feet, 25 feet, 30 feet,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.580]   something like that.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.320]   Or you can consider something like a pop-up camper.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.360]   Here are my arguments in favor
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.560]   of your considering a pop-up camper.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.380]   A pop-up tent camper has all of the basic infrastructure
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.040]   that you need to have adequate comfort.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.080]   It solves all of those basic things
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.320]   that are uncomfortable about a tent.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.240]   In your pop-up camper, you can have a comfortable bed.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.660]   You can use a residential mattress,
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.720]   you can have a foam mattress, whatever you like,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.120]   but you have a large residential bed
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.040]   that you can put nice covers on.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.320]   It can be comfortable, it can be beautiful, et cetera.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.520]   And one of the great things about a pop-up tent camper
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.620]   is there are lots of beds, lots of bed space.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.460]   You can fit many children into a pop-up tent camper.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.280]   So you could solve that problem of being up off the ground
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.300]   for your sleeping and out of the dirt,
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.440]   which is hugely important.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.020]   In a pop-up tent camper,
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.240]   you have all of the basic cooking gear ready to go.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.800]   You have a propane stove, usually.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.720]   You have a sink with a water tank,
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.960]   which is very convenient.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.500]   And then usually you have a fridge of some kind,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.040]   whether it's DC electricity or propane
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.520]   or a combination of the two.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.720]   So you have your basic cooking gear ready to go.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.980]   That makes a big difference
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.240]   because it's much faster for you just to set up a kitchen
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.320]   and have everything in cabinets
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.560]   than it is to haul the cooler out of the car
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.100]   and set up the stove on the table
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.640]   and then figure out how to get it under the canopy.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.040]   It's just all there.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.960]   You have privacy for using a toilet, things like that.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   It's one of the frustrations of a tent.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.680]   Yeah, you could bring along a cassette toilet
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.480]   and set it up in the tent,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.180]   but you have a little bit more privacy in a pop-up camper.
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.000]   Not as much privacy as in a nice hard-sided camper,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.240]   but you have adequate privacy.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.880]   You have a built-in electrical system.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.220]   You have a battery power.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.200]   You have a converter that can charge the batteries
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.040]   and you can plug it in.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.560]   You have lights.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.080]   Very importantly, in a pop-up camper,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.760]   you can have an air conditioner,
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.560]   which for those of us who live in hot places,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.660]   an air conditioner makes a huge difference
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.720]   in your ability to use your camper.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.480]   So you can have an AC for the hot days,
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.640]   and that AC is usually easily able to be run
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.200]   on a small generator,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.620]   which can be very easily taken with you.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.300]   And/or you have a small propane heater,
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.480]   often built into the camper.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.300]   So you're adequate to cover yourself when it's cold.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.800]   Or if you don't have something built in,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.600]   you are in an enclosed space that's small enough,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.840]   has a little bit better insulation than most tents,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.160]   so you can just use some kind of portable heater
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.360]   inside of the camper.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   So a pop-up camper offers all of the basic amenities.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.280]   There's very little difference in terms of the way
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.960]   that the systems of a pop-up camper work
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.740]   versus a large half-million dollar motorhome.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.220]   All the systems basically work the same.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.680]   The motorhome has a heater,
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.860]   and it has ducting down into the bays underneath,
[00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.260]   and it's got maybe two thermostats or something like that,
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.980]   but at the end of the day, it's just got a heater.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.760]   The motorhome has a couple of air conditioners,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.780]   but they're about the same as the air conditioners
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.100]   on your pop-up camper.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.300]   The motorhome has a generator that's built in,
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.440]   and it might be a diesel,
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.620]   but you're a little generator that you can just grab
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.580]   out of the back of your car and put by the back
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.660]   and plug it in, it'll work great.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.500]   Basically, all the systems work the same.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.340]   They're just slightly fancier and shinier
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.300]   in the half-million dollar motorhome.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   So a pop-up camper offers a massive upgrade in convenience
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.340]   and comfort over tent camping,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:39.940]   but yet it's not extreme like some of the bigger ones are.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.780]   It's a massive improvement.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.340]   It's a big, big step up.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.460]   So you'll probably get better buy-in
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.180]   from your family members.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.660]   It'll be a little bit easier for me.
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.540]   It's a lot easier on my wife.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.300]   Instead of making her do everything in the dirt
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.660]   and just hassle, having facilities is really useful.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.780]   And the pop-up camper has very usable space.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.780]   It doesn't have a lot of interior space.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.260]   That's a major downside of a pop-up camper,
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.340]   but the interior space that it does have is very useful.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.180]   It's useful for beds, et cetera.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.660]   Not great to hang out in, pretty small,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.980]   but it has lots of bed space,
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.300]   and it gets you out of the weather when you need to.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.020]   Other big, big benefits of a pop-up camper though.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.500]   A pop-up camper is easy to tow,
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.940]   probably with the vehicle that you have.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.220]   And when you're towing,
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.340]   so boys, you're needing to buy another vehicle,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:32.020]   a special vehicle, and it's not as tiring to have it.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.140]   When I bought a travel trailer,
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.100]   I bought a travel trailer,
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.540]   and then I bought a big one-ton 15-passenger van
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.700]   to pull it with.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.300]   And the numbers on the paper should have been
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.780]   that my travel trailer should have been able to be pulled
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.900]   by the van that I had.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.220]   The numbers all worked in terms of the tow rating.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.580]   Now, I'm still not exactly sure what happened,
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.940]   why it didn't work,
[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.140]   but my van, I couldn't get the travel trailer
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.300]   over 50 miles an hour,
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.820]   even with the engine running flat out.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.220]   It may have been a problem with the van.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.060]   It may have been a problem
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.460]   that I just bought the wrong engine,
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:07.340]   but it was a big one-ton van with a big Chevy 350 V8.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.380]   It should have been able to do it, but it couldn't.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.020]   And so it could have certainly pulled a pop-up camper,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.020]   but I had to upgrade the whole tow vehicle
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.380]   and buy a big diesel pickup truck
[00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.980]   to pull this big trailer around.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.100]   One of the things about a big vehicle
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.780]   that I underestimated before I had one
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.860]   is that it's very tiring to drive a big vehicle.
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.060]   Now, perhaps you wouldn't be so silly
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.420]   as to underestimate that,
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.780]   but I was surprised by that.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.100]   I love big vehicles.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.980]   I enjoy driving big trucks.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.380]   I'm very comfortable driving big trucks.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.460]   I've driven big trucks.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.260]   I've been driving trailers my whole life.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.340]   I was the 15-year-old who was out backing trailers up
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.060]   around my parents' house every which way
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.820]   so that I could become a very skillful trailer backer.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.980]   I wanted to make sure that I knew
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.180]   I would never embarrass myself,
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.060]   and so I would know how to do it.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.740]   I've driven big trucks my whole life
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.380]   and been very comfortable with it.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.580]   But even so, I have to concede
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.500]   that driving a big vehicle
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.180]   is not nearly as comfortable as driving a smaller one.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.140]   In the time, one of the things I really wanted
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.860]   when I bought the Class B van camper
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.220]   that we owned for a time
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.380]   is I really wanted something
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.220]   that would be comfortable for me to drive to conferences.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.660]   I like to go to conferences.
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.780]   I find them very useful.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.540]   Go for four days, go out to Texas,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.180]   or go up to Georgia, or something like that.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.420]   And so I thought, "This will be great.
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.620]   "I'll have this Class B.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.340]   "It's super simple and nimble,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.620]   "and I'll drive it to Texas,
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.820]   "and that way I don't have to bother with the hotel.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:35.860]   "I can just camp along the way.
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.460]   "It'll just be me traveling."
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.820]   It'll be really wonderful.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.020]   It was work.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.660]   I very, I did use it a couple of times,
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.900]   but it was big.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.060]   It was thirsty, and it was work to drive it.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.860]   And I got to the point where I realized
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.780]   that even though I had this nice RV,
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.780]   and I had all the stuff in it,
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.980]   I had all the amenities,
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.260]   it was an RV, a comfortable bed,
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.420]   I would just as soon either just stay in the hotel,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.620]   drive a car, or fly and stay in the hotel
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.060]   like normal people do,
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.020]   or just stay in my minivan.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.460]   More comfortable and easier to drive,
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.140]   and if I'm gonna go 1,000 miles,
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.740]   it's just a lot less work and a lot cheaper
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.500]   to drive a minivan than to drive this Class B RV.
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.660]   Similar thing happened with the travel trailer.
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.100]   I dragged the travel trailer all across the country,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.060]   15,000 miles, and I'm very comfortable,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.700]   grew to become very comfortable driving it.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.780]   It was no big deal.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.620]   I'm good at driving it.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.700]   I'm good at backing it, et cetera.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.940]   But when I had it,
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.540]   I never took it on any short-term trips,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.980]   but it was such a hassle to hook the thing up
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.700]   and to deal with where am I gonna park it, et cetera,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.300]   I didn't think I would ever use it for a short-term trip.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.940]   It wasn't the kind of thing where I would use it
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.600]   for a quick weekend getaway.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.180]   Just too much of a hassle.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.420]   I wouldn't wanna drag it to North Carolina.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.060]   North Carolina's not that far away,
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.180]   but it would just be a hassle for me
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.060]   to drag it to North Carolina.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.680]   So I underestimated that.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.580]   It's tiring and annoying to have to deal
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.700]   with a big vehicle.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.040]   Even if you're kind of that little boy like I am,
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.660]   or I love driving big vehicles, I like having 'em,
[00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.820]   it's tiring and annoying.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.660]   A pop-up camper is very, very easy to tow.
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.980]   Because of the way that it's situated,
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.720]   where it's very low, it's usually hidden behind the vehicle,
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.980]   you can see over it, it's short, it's not long,
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.860]   saying the same thing again, short, not long,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.620]   it's easy to tow, it's easy to park,
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.460]   it's easy to get in and around.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.340]   You hardly know it's there.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.260]   If you're driving a normal pickup truck,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.100]   or a van, or something like that,
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.820]   it's the kind of trailer where it just doesn't bother you.
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.180]   It's like driving a little 12 or 15 foot
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.940]   landscaping trailer around.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.500]   It's light, you don't even care.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.780]   You can keep it hooked up all the time, it doesn't matter.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.980]   A lot easier to tow, and that's a huge advantage,
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:51.660]   because it means there's a good chance
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.420]   you're more likely to use it.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.160]   With a pop-up camper, when I've driven across
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.140]   with a pop-up camper, and I have camped in them
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.500]   as an adult, borrowed friends and relatives,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.260]   it's not at all intimidating or annoying
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.380]   to drag it three states away.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.940]   Whereas a large travel trailer is,
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.980]   even if you're well equipped for it.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:14.180]   A pop-up camper is easy to drive around in cities
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.380]   and at attractions, which is very useful,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.800]   and it's easy to back into a campsite.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.300]   One of the things I did not like about a pop-up camper
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.820]   was, when I was younger, was I didn't like
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.700]   how long it took to set the thing up.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.140]   You had to put the top up, you had to pick the cabinets up,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.200]   I always just thought, this is a real pain.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.060]   I want just a hard-sided camper that I could just
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.220]   pull in and be ready to go.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.700]   Then I had a hard-sided camper that I could just pull in,
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.620]   and what I found out was, there's a whole bunch
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.540]   of setup time needed for that, too.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.540]   You have to get it backed in.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.740]   And even if you are a very skillful trailer backer,
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.160]   as I am, even if you're that, even if you're skillful,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.700]   it takes time to back a big trailer into a small campsite.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.660]   It takes time to get it all situated exactly how you want it
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.060]   so there's room for the slide to come out.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.860]   It takes time to get it level and to figure out
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.020]   exactly how to get it level so that it's gonna work well.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.340]   And then, once you set it up, you still gotta put
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.900]   your stabilizers down, you gotta unhook
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.380]   this big weight distribution hitch that comes
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.620]   with all these extra levers and chains and such
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.000]   that you gotta deal with.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.060]   Then you gotta put the slides out,
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.400]   you gotta get everything just so,
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.340]   so it takes time to set up the travel trailer.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.900]   It's not as simple as you just pull in and you're there.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.860]   That's a benefit in favor of motorhomes
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.500]   with the self-leveling jacks,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.860]   but that's more on the higher end.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.180]   If you're shopping in that market,
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.920]   you're not gonna want a pop-up camper.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.480]   But you do have to do a few extra things
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.420]   with a pop-up camper.
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.660]   You've gotta put the top up, you gotta slide the beds out,
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.580]   you gotta brace everything.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:58.040]   But I would bet you that I could do it faster
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.880]   with a pop-up camper.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.920]   I never had the chance to put it side by side,
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.360]   but I bet you I could have a pop-up camper ready to go
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.520]   faster than a travel trailer,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.820]   just because of the ease of getting it backed in
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.440]   and getting it set right where you want it.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.040]   Then, even the frustration of putting things up,
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.240]   really, what's the difference between cranking up the top
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:21.240]   on a pop-up tent camper versus putting a slide out
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.100]   or putting two or three slides out?
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.900]   You still gotta sit there and wait for it,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.580]   and you can buy pop-up campers that have an electric motor,
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.500]   or you can just use something as simple
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.780]   as the electric motor in your drill and put them up.
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.900]   Which brings me to some of the bigger,
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.260]   more important benefits of a pop-up camper.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.700]   My number one reason why I would want to have
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.820]   a pop-up camper out instead of a travel trailer
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.620]   is that a pop-up camper is easy to store
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.360]   inside and undercover.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.340]   It's easy to store in your garage,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.480]   or in a shed, or in a carport.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.860]   It's so small, it's easy to store,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.340]   and that makes a huge, huge difference.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.700]   Because you can store it inside easily and inexpensively,
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.820]   that means you can keep it out of the sun.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.140]   You can keep it out of the rain.
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.100]   You can keep it out of the cold.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   And that will make your RV last longer.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.740]   The biggest enemy of a travel trailer,
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.260]   especially when you're unlikely to use it very much,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.460]   as most families are, more than a few weeks a year,
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.660]   is it's just gonna sit outside,
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.100]   and for, let's say you use it four weeks a year,
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.340]   48 weeks of the year it's gonna sit outside and rot,
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.660]   and four weeks of the year you're gonna use it.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.460]   But you're only gonna be able to use it for a short time
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.700]   because you're gonna get annoyed at driving around
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.420]   with a rotten camper.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.340]   The sun beats on the roof and degrades the rubber
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.540]   and degrades the seals,
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.820]   and then a little bit of water gets in
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.100]   and it starts rotting the walls,
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.140]   and pretty next thing you know
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.420]   you've got something delaminating here,
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.940]   or delaminating there.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.540]   Now does it have to be that way?
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.380]   Certainly not.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:05.160]   Maybe you have a barn you can stick it in,
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.400]   or maybe you build a shed on the side of your house
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.240]   to put it in.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.060]   I think you should do that if you're gonna buy a big camper.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.900]   But drive around anywhere and you'll see
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.340]   that most campers stay outside,
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.780]   getting beat on by the sun
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.580]   and getting beat on by the rain, et cetera.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.380]   And then once something starts,
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.900]   you get a little bit of mold or it starts to rot,
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.620]   then it gets frustrating to you
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.300]   and you don't like it all that much and it gets beat up.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.860]   Whereas if you can keep something inside,
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.620]   you can stop the rubber from deteriorating on the roof,
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.860]   you can stop it from delaminating,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.100]   you know that no water's getting into it
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.140]   'cause it's in your garage,
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.340]   and you know that no water is likely to get into it
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.020]   'cause all the seals are not getting as degraded.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.980]   Now because of that, you can keep it around
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.140]   for years and years
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.260]   and it's probably gonna stay in great shape.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.360]   If you go and look at a 15-year-old travel trailer
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.280]   that sat out in the sun for 15 years,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.780]   you don't wanna own the thing.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.860]   But if you go and look at a 15-year-old pop-up camper
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.820]   that's been garage kept, it'll look great, it'll look nice.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.100]   And yes, there's still gonna be maintenance involved,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.860]   you're still gonna wanna refresh the seals
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.260]   and put a little goop on it here and there,
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.380]   but that's normal and it's gonna be in great shape.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.820]   Your tires are gonna last longer,
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.500]   everything's gonna last longer if you can keep it inside.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   Because you can keep it inside
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.280]   and because it'll last longer,
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.780]   you'll feel less frustrated about it depreciating,
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.300]   about it just collapsing in value.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.820]   These things are not cheap.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.340]   You know, a new travel trailer,
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.360]   you can get them new for $20,000 to $30,000
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.060]   depending on what size range you're dealing in.
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.180]   I'm thinking about a 30-foot trailer, something like that,
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.260]   $25,000, you can find a new one.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.980]   But as soon as you keep it for a year or two,
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.500]   it's down to 15, there goes 10 grand,
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.620]   and then they just keep going down from there.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.980]   And so if you care about money and you care about value,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.660]   you're probably not gonna wanna have an RV
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.220]   sitting in your backyard just getting rotten
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.980]   and destroying any value that there is in it.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.080]   So if you can keep it under cover,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.780]   you're gonna have less frustration about keeping it around,
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.880]   even if it's just for a rare use.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.620]   That to me is a huge, huge benefit.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.140]   When you can keep something inside,
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.480]   if you'll properly service everything,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.880]   then it should work when you go to use it,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.600]   unlike keeping it outside when it's rotting
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.700]   and stuff's just falling apart due to non-use.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.200]   I don't know how to emphasize it any more than I did.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.720]   As far as I'm concerned,
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.700]   that is one of the number one benefits of a pop-up camper.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.640]   Yes, the benefits of it being light and nimble
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.480]   are also significant,
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.760]   but being able to store it inside
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.280]   means it's not going to be falling apart.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.560]   That's tremendous.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.720]   Pop-up campers are simple, and this is really wonderful.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.960]   Because when you own an RV,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.160]   basically you have a cheaply built,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   usually, cheaply built wooden shell
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.160]   with a little bit of wallpaper slapped up inside
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.080]   and a little bit of aluminum slapped up outside.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.200]   That's not that big of a deal.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.720]   Yes, it can get water in there
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.600]   and it can start rotting on you,
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.760]   but your issues are probably gonna be the systems inside.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.600]   One of the great things about a pop-up camper
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.540]   is it doesn't have some of the systems
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.080]   that otherwise can break,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.660]   and the systems that it does have are simple enough
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.160]   that you'll probably feel confident
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.300]   just to swap 'em out yourself.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.980]   One of the things I like about a pop-up camper
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.040]   is you can avoid the whole need for a blackwater tank.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.800]   You can just simply use a cassette toilet
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.600]   instead of a blackwater tank,
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.840]   which totally changes your relationship with RV parks
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.420]   when you don't have to constantly find a place
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.660]   to dump your black tanks.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.360]   Pop-up campers can have a heater, but it's simple enough.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.000]   You can pull it in and pull it out.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.440]   It's just very, very simple.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.640]   And I actually, if I were buying one today,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.680]   I would be happy to buy one
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.700]   where only a couple of the systems are built in.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.040]   I think it's nice to have a sink
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.360]   that has a 12-volt pump run to a water tank.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.000]   I think that's useful.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.600]   I don't care that much about the stove system.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.080]   A stove, a little propane stove,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.160]   is just as easy to set up as one that's built in.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.120]   That's not a big deal.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.320]   A cassette toilet is really great.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.720]   Beyond that, a few electronics, great,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.200]   but I don't mind bringing in and just adding
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.120]   the type of solar generator,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.480]   like a Yeti type of thing that you see
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.800]   where a power station,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.320]   where there's a lithium battery in it
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.040]   with some AC plugs and some DC plugs, add some lighting.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   That stuff can all be dealt with pretty simply.
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.540]   And so because pop-up campers are simple,
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.760]   you can fix them when you need to.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.240]   You can just throw the old stuff away
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.960]   and put something in portable.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.640]   These days, I just as soon choose the portable option.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.840]   Think of it like this.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.360]   How happy are you if you, in 2005,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.960]   bought the top-of-the-line navigation system in your car
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.840]   versus today, the navigation system
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.240]   that's in your cell phone?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.720]   A lot easier just to have your cell phone
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.000]   and plop it there and use that to navigate.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.080]   For this audience, you would appreciate
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.680]   that the economics of a pop-up truck camper are fantastic.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   They are cheap to buy, even if you buy one new.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   Now, in the used market, you can get them
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.200]   for $3,000 to $5,000 in very workable shape
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.700]   used all day long.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.100]   I'm not opposed these days to buying new RVs.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.240]   I think there's a place for that.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.160]   I don't think you should do it
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.080]   unless you're really sure that you're gonna have it
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.800]   for a long time because when you buy a new RV,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.520]   you'll never get out of it
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.040]   without losing a good amount of depreciation.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.040]   But if you can buy one for $3,000 to $5,000,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.080]   that's just not that much money, a good tent.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.020]   If you wanna bid out of the world of Walmart tents,
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.280]   a good tent can frequently be $1,000, a good family tent.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.700]   $3,000 to have a tent on wheels
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.200]   is not that big of a deal.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.680]   A lot of times, in my experience,
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.640]   you can find a great deal on a pop-up
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.880]   and it's likely to be in better shape
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.880]   than a travel trailer of its same vintage
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.880]   because of what I said about the weather.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.760]   The travel trailer may have been stored outside,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.520]   whereas the pop-up camper is likely
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.400]   to have been stored inside.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.100]   That's a tremendous benefit.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.140]   So they're cheap to buy.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.880]   Even if you buy them new, they're not that expensive.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.560]   Huge benefit, it's cheap to add on
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.360]   to whatever else you already have.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.000]   This may be a bigger deal for some people than others.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.280]   If you already have a big one-ton diesel truck
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.040]   that you use for work anyway,
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.560]   and you just run across a travel trailer, that's fine.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.880]   Grab the travel trailer, you'll enjoy it.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.200]   But most people have to think ahead.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.160]   Most people have a small SUV or a car
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.640]   or something like that.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.040]   Well, you often underestimate the cost of the whole thing.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   You go out and start looking at campers
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.920]   and you forget the fact
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.580]   that you're gonna wanna upgrade the car.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.440]   And you look at the tow rating on your medium-sized SUV,
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.320]   and it says it can handle 8,000 pounds.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.560]   But by the time you go down to the dealership
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   and you buy an RV that has a dry weight of 7,995 pounds,
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.280]   and the salesman says, "Yeah, you can do it.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.200]   "Your SUV is rated for that."
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.920]   And then all of a sudden you hook it up
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.940]   and then you fill it up and then you put stuff in it.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.560]   Then you feel like you're destroying the transmission
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.440]   on your SUV and you don't wanna do that.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.560]   Next thing you know, you got a new truck out there.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.920]   It's a hassle.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.160]   Pop-up camper usually doesn't need that.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.440]   It's cheap to add on to whatever else you already have.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.140]   The vast majority of SUVs and trucks and vans
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.080]   can pull a pop-up camper.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.020]   Now, you can get some really big and heavy pop-up campers
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.880]   that would not be able to be pulled with a minivan.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.940]   A minivan usually rated for about 3,500 pounds of towing,
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.240]   but you can find small pop-up campers that it can handle.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.100]   Most mid-size SUVs, most half-ton pickup trucks,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.660]   you can always find these things and they can do it.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.940]   There's no need for a new truck.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.980]   There's no need for a big diesel engine.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.180]   And that's worth it.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.380]   That's worth a lot.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.900]   So it's cheap to just add it on
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.300]   to whatever else you already have.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.020]   And the biggest thing, again, is the low profile of towing.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.540]   It's not all about weight.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.980]   A lot of it has to do with wind resistance.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.320]   How tall is that trailer?
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.980]   You could tow a fairly heavy trailer.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.060]   And once you get it going,
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.980]   as long as you don't have a ton of wind resistance,
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.720]   you can drive it pretty fast.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.340]   But if you have a big, tall trailer
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.540]   that sticks up high above your vehicle,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   that wind resistance does a lot of damage to your driveline.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.700]   Cheap to add on to the things that you already have.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.540]   Big benefit of pop-up camper, it's cheap to pull.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.940]   You have a radically cheaper fuel cost
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:53.420]   because of that low profile of, low towing profile
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.540]   versus a large, big box.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.220]   It's much cheaper to pull.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.380]   And that's probably useful.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.500]   It means you'll use it more.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.380]   It makes it easier to drive, like I said earlier,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.860]   but it also makes it cheaper to drive.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.180]   It's frustrating to think about
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.020]   heading across the country at eight miles per gallon.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.820]   But if you take an average vehicle,
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   and I'm guessing here,
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.260]   it's a little bit of educated guessing,
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.180]   but I have never taken a medium-sized SUV
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.080]   and towed a pop-up camper across the country.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.980]   But here's what I'm gonna guess.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.620]   Your medium-sized SUV might get you,
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.580]   say, 22 miles per gallon
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.780]   without towing anything on the highway.
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:33.340]   Maybe 25, depending on what SUV we're talking about here.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.860]   20 to 25.
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.700]   You'll probably lose five miles per gallon
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.780]   towing a pop-up camper.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.720]   But going to 15, from 20 to 15, or 25 to 18,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.720]   is not as difficult as going from 22 to 10,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.320]   like you get with a big travel trailer,
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.240]   or going from 22 to seven,
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.320]   like you get with a big fifth wheel,
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.400]   or going from 25 to six,
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.740]   like you get with a big Class A motorhome.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:09.400]   That's a big deal with regard to the economy,
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.100]   the economics of the thing.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.540]   Pop-up camper can be cheap to fix.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.080]   Need to fix the roof?
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.760]   Well, it's at waist level.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.920]   It's not that big.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.960]   You can look at it and feel pretty confident
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.580]   about going and getting a cock gun
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.320]   and putting goop on the roof, or redoing the rubber.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.120]   It's not as intimidating as being 13 feet off the ground
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.380]   with this big, huge thing,
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.200]   with all this stuff sticking through the roof,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.960]   where you don't know if you can do it or not.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.840]   You can do it.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.880]   Heater goes bad, pull it out,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.280]   say, we'll just use a Mr. Buddy heater next time.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   We don't need to replace it.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.460]   That's a little different
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.040]   when then your heater goes bad on your big 30 foot trailer,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.220]   and you need the ducks to come out in the front room
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.600]   and in the back room.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.920]   Well, now all of a sudden you're into it
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.720]   for a $400 new heater.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.340]   Hot water heater goes,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.180]   I could go on and on.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.020]   Bad fridge?
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:55.840]   Nah, you know what?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.080]   We don't need a propane fridge.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.100]   Let's just toss in one of these 12 volt refrigerators
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.440]   and add another battery.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.120]   Simple, cheap to fix, simple.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.780]   Big benefit of a pop-up camper,
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.800]   it's cheap to camp in.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.680]   You fit in the smaller spots,
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.920]   which can save you money.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:13.080]   You fit into more of your friend's driveways.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.620]   You can go visit more friends,
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.280]   unlike when you have a big giant thing
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.920]   and there's nowhere to park it.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.680]   You can drag a pop-up camper off-road
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   or into less developed areas
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.160]   much more easily than you can with a big trailer.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.080]   Out West in the Western United States,
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.440]   there is so much wonderful BLM land,
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.840]   government land all over the place
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.640]   that you can camp on without paying,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.840]   but it's hard to get a big trailer there a lot of times.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.760]   Little trailer can make it down a little rutted road,
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.360]   pull into beautiful clearing and set up for free.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.700]   Much easier than a big trailer.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.800]   Pop-up camper is cheap to keep.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.600]   Probably there's no need for storage fees.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.440]   This is a big deal.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.460]   Many times people buy a travel trailer,
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.480]   they park it in their yard,
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.940]   then all of a sudden code enforcement's knocking on the door
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.400]   or the homeowners association is knocking on the door
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.560]   and they say, "You can't keep that big trailer.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.240]   "Here, it's not allowed.
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.860]   "It's gotta be back behind the house
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.440]   "or it can't be here.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.640]   "We don't allow these in the HOA."
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.840]   So then now you gotta take it to a storage location
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.400]   and now you're paying a monthly rental fee
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.160]   for the storage location to keep it at a storage lot.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.880]   So now you're into a thing for thousands
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.360]   or thousands of dollars per year just for a parking space.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.960]   Pop-up camper may be able to fit inside of your garage,
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.480]   thus avoiding the problems
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.160]   with the homeowners association.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:34.000]   You can stash it more easily at a friend's house
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.160]   or a relative's house than a big giant camper
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.100]   where there's just no place for it.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.320]   And then, again, because you can keep it inside,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.260]   it's cheap to keep
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.420]   because it's not being destroyed by the weather
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.900]   and you're not so worried about it just falling apart on you.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.900]   And then pop-up campers are,
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.660]   the economics are great
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.220]   because they're inexpensive enough
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.340]   that if you wanna buy one new
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.900]   so you can get exactly what you want,
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.060]   all the options you want,
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.860]   have it all in perfect condition,
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.060]   you can justify buying one new, using it for a while,
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.720]   and then you can just go ahead and keep it for decades
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.360]   as a just-in-case plan.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.120]   There's really not that much that can go wrong on them.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.560]   And if you can keep them inside,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.040]   then they can stay in much better shape.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.120]   So for all these reasons,
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.520]   the economics of a pop-up camper are great.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.440]   Again, cheap to buy, cheap to add on to the equipment,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.200]   the vehicles that you already have.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.920]   They're cheap to pool, they're cheap to fix,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.680]   they're cheap to camp, they're cheap to keep,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.000]   and they're inexpensive enough
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.160]   that if you just wanna buy them new, that's fine.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.580]   Now, where does a pop-up camper not shine?
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.260]   Well, there are some important things.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:41.500]   Number one, they are not awesome in the rain.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.900]   It's a pain to put them up and down when it's wet,
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.100]   and you've gotta make sure they dry them out.
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.580]   In that way, they're like a tent.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.900]   It's not awesome to go tent camping in the rain,
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.500]   and it's not awesome to go pop-up camping in the rain.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.160]   It's not awesome to hang out in a pop-up camper
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.100]   for multiple days in bad weather, such as rain.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.480]   You're not gonna have the same experience
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.160]   that you'll have in a larger camper in bad weather.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.800]   Now, in general, this isn't a problem.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.960]   In general, for most trips, most just short-term vacations,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.560]   weekend here and there, usually you wanna be outside,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.840]   around the campfire, and you wanna be
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.080]   just embracing the weather, whatever it is.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.240]   That's very different than full-timing.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.040]   In full-timing, if you hit in bad weather,
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.400]   you need to be able to be productive,
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.920]   you need to be comfortable, you want that nice recliner,
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.240]   and you want your fireplace popping,
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.780]   and that recliner with your feet up,
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.680]   and whatever you've got on your satellite TV.
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.660]   But if you're full-timing, that stuff's important.
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.200]   But most people aren't full-timing,
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.920]   and you don't need all that comfort.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.840]   If it's raining and you're away for the weekend,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   go home early.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.960]   You can just quit.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.160]   So that's a big place they're not awesome.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.800]   It's adequate to get out of the rain
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.120]   for a day or two if you need to.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.800]   It's adequate.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.540]   Not awesome, but adequate.
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.060]   Better than a tent, at least,
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.120]   because you're not in the mud, you're not in the water.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.440]   But that is an important downside of pop-up campers.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.680]   Pop-up campers do take time to set up and tear down.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.280]   There is a little bit of extra time.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.080]   You do have to crank the top up and down,
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.920]   and you do have to put the cabinets up.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.720]   And so it does take a little bit of extra time,
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.480]   and there are occasions in which that extra time
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.600]   can be annoying, like going to the grocery store
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.960]   and getting groceries.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.280]   Well, are we really gonna put the top up on the trailer
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.360]   and put all this stuff away?
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.200]   Big trailer, it's easy.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.600]   You pop the door open, you go in,
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.760]   put stuff in the fridge, and get back in the car.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   Though that can be annoying.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.960]   And then I would say one of the biggest downsides
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.280]   of a pop-up camper is you really can't comfortably,
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.960]   at least I've never seen anybody do it,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.440]   you really can't boondock at just a side
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.520]   of the highway rest stop or a Walmart parking lot.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.380]   One of the things that I love about fixed RVs
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.960]   is that ability just to pull over,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.440]   climb in your bed, and go to sleep.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.480]   You can find a safe place to park
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.000]   where you're not gonna get hassled
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.600]   by somebody telling you to move on.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.760]   You can be as comfortable anywhere
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.600]   as you are anywhere else.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.580]   And I actually really like it.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.240]   I like pulling into the rest stop on the highway
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.080]   and sleeping.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.240]   I like the Walmart parking lot scene.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.160]   I enjoy that stuff.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.640]   It makes me feel, I don't know, fun.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.440]   It makes me feel cool to be able to be there.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.160]   And it's fun when you have your whole home with you
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   that you can just, you wake up in the morning,
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.760]   you look out the window, and you say, where are we today?
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.200]   Now, when I was younger, that was my number one reason
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.280]   why I wanted an RV.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   And I especially was interested in the economics of it.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.680]   The idea that by just staying at the side
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.560]   of the highway rest stop, you could avoid having to pay
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.340]   for a night's accommodation.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.160]   That can be a big deal.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.800]   It's hard to find, even at just a bad hotel
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.280]   in the United States, most places,
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.480]   it's hard to find one for cheaper than 70, 80 bucks.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.080]   And a lot of times those ones, you don't really wanna
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.280]   take your shoes off, you don't really wanna touch,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.800]   it's kinda questionable.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.360]   So usually you're at 100 bucks to get kind of a moderate
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.080]   rate hotel or more.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.720]   And the RV can save you that money.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:13.760]   But it can also save you money on things like food.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.320]   For example, when you have a fixed RV,
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.600]   it's fairly easy to say, hey, it's lunchtime,
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.520]   and you pull over into the rest stop
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.600]   or pull over into a parking lot.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.680]   You've got all your food ready to go, made up there.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.560]   That's a big deal for me, and I really like that.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.840]   And I really would be loathe to give it up.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.640]   Especially when full-timing, it's huge.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.520]   But for family vacations, I think that it's worth
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:42.980]   giving that up.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.760]   I think it's worth it.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.800]   At this point in time, for the family vacation model
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.000]   of travel, I would just happily pay for a hotel
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.200]   for the night, and happily pay for a restaurant meal,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.120]   if necessary, while moving fast across the country,
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.920]   instead of worrying about being able to sleep
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.440]   at a Walmart, just get the hotel.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.880]   And the reason is, all those maintenance items,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.280]   when you own an RV, really is where your big money goes out.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.720]   Remember when I had to fix the generator on my motorhome,
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.640]   and it was 1,000 bucks.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.620]   And I had worked on it myself, I had diagnosed it,
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.320]   I had downloaded the stuff off.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:25.020]   1,000 was too much, it was $700, something like that.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.520]   I had downloaded all the manuals, I had troubleshot
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.580]   everything, I had corresponded, I had tried to do it
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.340]   myself, and finally I just came to the point
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:35.980]   where it wasn't working right, and I had to just get it
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.380]   done by the professional.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.980]   700 bucks to service the generator.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.060]   And I was really annoyed, because when you have to deal
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.180]   with maintenance items and things like that,
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.180]   that's money you can never get out of the deal.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.940]   When you go to sell it, nobody gives you an extra $700
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:53.360]   because you had generator service.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.340]   That's just the cost of doing business,
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.020]   cost of having one of the things.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.740]   And when you start comparing $700 here, and $600 there,
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.940]   and $800 there, all of a sudden you can buy a lot
[00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.080]   of hotel rooms for that money.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.460]   Now is it economical to full-time in an RV
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.560]   and be able to save money while traveling hard
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:13.460]   across the country?
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.700]   Absolutely, if you're full-timing.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.940]   But for the family vacation model, nah, no way.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.640]   There's no way you come out ahead.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.580]   The hotel is a cheaper deal.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.900]   So in summary, for a family that wants to be able
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.820]   to get out into the woods, park, get out in the woods,
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.220]   or national parks, state parks, et cetera,
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.900]   with a bit more comfort than a tent,
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:41.360]   but who doesn't need luxury, then I think a pop-up camper
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.200]   is ideal.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.100]   It's best paired, in my opinion, with something
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.860]   like a big full-size van if you have one of those.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.460]   But whatever you have is fine.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:52.780]   It's an ideal compromise.
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.860]   If it's me, if I move back to the United States
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.820]   in the future, it's what I'll buy.
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.060]   I'll buy a full-size van and a pop-up camper.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.540]   I'd buy a used one.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.020]   I can't bring myself to buy one new,
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:06.060]   but I would shop the new market, you never know.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:09.060]   But I would buy a full-size van and a pop-up camper.
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.660]   Now would I like to have a motorhome?
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:15.820]   I'd love one if you give it to me.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.860]   But unless I'm full-timing, it's hard to see
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.460]   how I could stomach the fuel bill to cover the distances
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.740]   that I would enjoy covering.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.460]   Going across the country at six or eight miles per gallon
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.300]   gets pretty old.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.180]   And so just the economy of being able to travel freely,
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:37.260]   and it means it gets used more.
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.380]   Fifth wheel, same thing.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.940]   For full-timing, fifth wheel would be awesome.
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.620]   Is there a weekend here or there to tow that big old thing
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:46.060]   and deal with it?
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.420]   It's just a pain.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.620]   And again, I'd have to keep a big diesel pickup truck
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.180]   around at eight, 10 miles per gallon.
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.300]   Travel trailer, fine.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.220]   But basically the same problem as a fifth wheel.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.420]   It's a hassle, like I described earlier.
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.340]   What about a small travel trailer?
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.260]   Well, for me, I don't really fit well in a small travel trailer.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.580]   Shoulders are too big, too tall, et cetera.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.660]   And there are not enough beds for my family.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.860]   Usually two people fit well in the small travel
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.940]   trailers, and I don't see the point.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.380]   The bathrooms are uncomfortable.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.140]   They're too small.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.460]   I don't want to use the shower.
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.260]   I don't use the TV.
[00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.820]   So why do I need that stuff?
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.420]   So when I was younger, I promised myself
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.060]   I would never have a pop-up.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.540]   But at this point in time, I've decided
[00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.780]   that a pop-up is right for me.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.540]   It really is.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.500]   Now, I would be remiss if I didn't close this show
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.260]   with an email that I got from a listener
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.380]   back when I mentioned this.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.460]   I guess this was seven months ago now,
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.220]   where a listener heard me and wrote this email in.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.180]   This is a long-time listener of the show.
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.900]   Hey, Josh, I wanted to write about halfway
[00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.580]   into the travel trailer episode and push back
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.260]   on you a little bit.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:54.620]   When I heard you were going to recommend a pop-up,
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.900]   I almost drove into the ditch.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.860]   Not really.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.740]   In our evolution of camping, we went from a tent to a pop-up,
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.540]   back to a tent, and then to an 18-foot travel trailer
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.380]   with bunks for the kids.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.460]   I would never recommend a pop-up or buy another one.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:11.860]   We bought ours new.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.060]   All the used ones smelled like mildew,
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.780]   which should have been a red flag.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.900]   Also, we planned on keeping it long enough
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.340]   so the depreciation didn't hurt so much.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.220]   It was $12,000.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:25.020]   We kept it for three years and traveled several thousand miles
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.220]   in it, probably five to eight weeks a year camping.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.980]   There are plenty of downsides to a pop-up.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:33.300]   In the humid south, unless you can keep it
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:36.220]   in a dehumidified garage, it will mildew
[00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.540]   and smell.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.220]   It's uncomfortable at temperature extremes.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:42.980]   It's a pain to set up or take down in the rain.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.780]   You can't pull over during a trip
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.460]   and send the kids to the bathroom,
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.380]   or access the fridge, or prepare a meal.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.420]   It's hard to pull over at a rest stop and sleep
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.540]   because it's so much work to put it up or down.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.380]   Unless we stopped in a campground for the night,
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.740]   we would often just get a hotel
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:00.100]   while on the road for long trips.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.460]   I think the perfect solution is the trailer we have now.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.740]   It is 19 feet, weighs 3,400 pounds,
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.300]   so you don't need a diesel to pull it.
[00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.780]   Gas is a little cheaper.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.180]   We've slept three adults and two kids for a week
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.860]   with one kid on the floor.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.940]   It has bunk beds and a table that makes a queen.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.620]   It has a full fridge and freezer,
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.500]   which the pop-up didn't have.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.220]   It also has a stand-up separate shower with toilet
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.580]   that has fresh, gray, and black waste tanks.
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.300]   Pop-up doesn't have that, microwave.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.220]   It is so very simple to set up and take down.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.820]   Basically, just pull over and hop in
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:34.020]   if you need to use the bathroom
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.140]   or make a meal or sleep for the night.
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.940]   It really is like being at home.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.260]   I'd go back to a tent before a pop-up again.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.020]   As for use, we use ours at least three times a year
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.860]   to visit family and stay in their yards
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.220]   as the house is full,
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.540]   including two weeks every year in Tennessee.
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.900]   We also take several three-night trips to the beach.
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.380]   Just got back from St. Augustine
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.820]   and a week or so in the mountains.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.340]   It's very comfortable at temperature extremes.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.260]   One of the best things, as I'm sure you know,
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:04.020]   is being about to load up the fridge and freezer at home.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.420]   Turn it on, have food supplies,
[00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:06.740]   and we get to the campground.
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:08.460]   You can't do that in a pop-up.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.420]   We paid $16,500 for our travel trailer.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.780]   It was one year old and used twice.
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.860]   We haven't had, what, one maintenance problem
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.140]   in over a year.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.420]   I just had to replace the converter and buy a new battery
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.780]   as the factory-installed one
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.140]   didn't bring the battery up to enough volts.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.300]   I upgraded to a Group 31 AGM
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.380]   so we can boondock a little more.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.020]   One downside to a smaller camper
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.620]   is that the waste tanks are smaller.
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:32.180]   We can only last about three days
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.500]   with normal use for a family of four.
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.980]   I think a small travel trailer,
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.420]   something like our Riverside Retro,
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.700]   a Scamp, or a Casita, would be the perfect choice.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.340]   Plus, if you ever do need to bug out,
[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.900]   it's much easier in a small travel trailer than a pop-up.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.400]   So, still watching,
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.380]   Housing says, "Please don't recommend a pop-up.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.160]   "It's the worst purchase we made.
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.500]   "I'd rather spend $400 on two really good sleeping pads
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.660]   "like we have and stay in a tent.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.020]   "Maybe different for others,
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.840]   "but I've never heard anyone who's owned one
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.480]   "for three to five years say great things about them."
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:10.920]   So, that was Brandon, who lives in South Carolina.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:16.580]   You have to consider your own situation.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.300]   And this may be unique.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.660]   I do concede that if you can get away
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.020]   with a small travel trailer,
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.860]   that there are benefits to it.
[00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.700]   And if I were two people, I certainly would do that.
[00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.020]   One of the big benefits I would point out
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.660]   about a pop-up, though, it does have more bed space.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.500]   And with the size of my family,
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.540]   that's important, is to figure out
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.900]   where do you put all the beds.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.340]   And I did the bunkhouse model.
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.260]   I had the big bunkhouse, and it was super comfortable,
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:50.100]   but it had all of those downsides that I mentioned to you.
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.420]   I do think it is important to be able
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.540]   to store it out of the weather.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.820]   And in that case, you would treat it like a tent.
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.540]   And I think that would solve that basic problem.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.940]   As to being uncomfortable in temperature extremes,
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.780]   yes, I think it can be,
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:09.060]   but it's more comfortable than a tent.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.280]   So, you can run the air conditioner, simple to do.
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:17.980]   If you are considering purchasing an RV of some kind,
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.820]   what I would recommend that you do,
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.820]   as with almost anything else, is rent.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.460]   Rent some different options and try them out.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.980]   It's fairly easy in most places to rent a pop-up camper.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.340]   You should be able to find one.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.940]   We took a rental pop-up camper
[00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.620]   from Florida to the Grand Canyon one time,
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:36.940]   and it worked fine.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.100]   So, you can rent one, try it out that way.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.980]   Rent a few different travel trailers,
[00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.120]   and rent a big motorhome,
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.140]   if you're thinking about going that direction.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:51.120]   There's been such a proliferation in the rental marketplace
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.940]   that now you can find almost anything to rent.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.940]   Don't think that it's expensive to rent a camper
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.060]   and you'll just save money by buying one.
[00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.300]   You will not.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.460]   It's not expensive to rent a camper.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.980]   It is much cheaper than buying one.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.220]   You won't know today, if you've never owned one,
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.300]   you won't know all the little expenses that add up,
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.540]   but it's cheaper to rent it,
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.500]   which is probably why you should rent it anyway.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.380]   You should just dispense with buying it.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.720]   In the long run.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.900]   Usually there you get into just how many nights
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.180]   you're actually gonna use it,
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.380]   and then availability, et cetera.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.820]   But renting is a wonderful option.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.660]   I will fully concede the point about pop-up campers
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.980]   not being able just to get in and have a meal.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.920]   And that is one thing that's lovely
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.480]   about a fixed trailer, fixed motorhome, et cetera.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.620]   That's all I've got to say on the subject.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.960]   I hope that was a good, useful thing for you to consider.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.420]   Try it for yourself.
[00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.900]   Just always be careful.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.980]   I will tell you, it is possible,
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.580]   many people lose a lot of money on RVs,
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.140]   and because of that, you have an opportunity.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.180]   If you're careful and if you're patient,
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.980]   and if you take your time, you can do okay.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.260]   But you need to be prepared that whatever you buy,
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.100]   it is not an investment.
[00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:10.900]   It is purely an expense,
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.540]   and you're gonna come out of it
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.000]   with less money in your pocket than you have going in.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.260]   So make sure you can afford that.
