[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.400]   highly successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.200]   investment opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.440]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.760]   totally free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.120]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.960]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.160]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.040]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.760]   Today's conversation is all about distraction, something that impacts all
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   of us, and I know because it definitely takes a toll on me almost every day.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   So I'm talking with Nir Eyal about becoming what he calls indistractable.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.840]   Almost sounds like a superpower, right?
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.360]   Now, Nir has quite the impressive background.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.920]   He's previously taught at the Stanford Graduate School of
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.600]   Business and their design school.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   He's co-founded and sold two tech companies.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.560]   He's an active angel investor.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   But perhaps most relevant to today, he's the author of two best-selling books.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.080]   First, "Hooked - How to Build Habit-Forming Products."
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   And second, "Indistractable - How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Life," which has received critical acclaim, winning the Outstanding Works
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.920]   of Literature award, as well as being named one of the best business and
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   leadership books of the year by Amazon.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.600]   In our conversation, we discuss the hidden psychology that drives us to
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.120]   distraction and what so many people get wrong about overcoming it.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.040]   Nir also shares his four-step research-backed model for becoming
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.960]   indistractable and how to use it to take back control of your time and
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.160]   start making traction on the things that matter to you in your life.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.920]   This episode is so chocked full of actionable advice, so let's jump in.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.880]   Nir, thanks for being here.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.240]   Great to be here, Chris.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.680]   Thanks.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.640]   Yeah, so I went into reading your latest book and I was thinking that if I could
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.360]   become indistractable, I could just avoid my notifications.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.760]   And I quickly realized it is a whole lot more than that.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.880]   And so I thought a good way to just kick off is how do you
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   actually define distraction?
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.160]   Absolutely.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.920]   So this is a great question because it's a term that I think I thought I
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.240]   understood, but really didn't once I started diving into this research around
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.000]   the psychology of why we get distracted.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.360]   So the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.520]   what distraction is not.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.640]   So what is the opposite of distraction?
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.560]   Most people will say, "Well, it's obviously, right?
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.240]   It's focus."
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.280]   Well, not true.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.360]   The opposite of distraction is not focus.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.680]   If you look at the origin of the word, the opposite of distraction is traction.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.760]   That by definition, traction is any action that pulls you towards what you
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.640]   say you're going to do.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.680]   Things that move you closer to your goals, closer to your values, help you
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.040]   become the kind of person you want to become.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.920]   The opposite of traction, distraction.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.760]   Distraction is any action that pulls you further away from your goals, further
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.880]   away from what you said you were going to do, further away from your values and
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.640]   further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.680]   So this isn't just semantics.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.440]   This is super important because I would argue any action, by the way, you notice
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.320]   that both traction and distraction end in the same six letters, A-C-T-I-O-N, that
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.200]   spells action.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.280]   So I would argue that any action that you do with intent, anything that it uses for
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   thought is traction, right?
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.800]   It's what you plan to do.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.120]   Anything that is not that is distraction.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.960]   So let me give you an example.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.840]   So driving home, you know, for years I would go to my desk and I'd say, "Okay,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.120]   I'm going to get to work right now.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.840]   I got my cup of coffee.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.760]   I got everything set.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   I'm going to focus.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I'm going to do what I said I'm going to do.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040]   I got my list of to-do's."
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.320]   By the way, we can talk about why to-do's are one of the worst things you can do for
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.840]   your productivity.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.560]   We can get to that later.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.960]   "Now I'm going to get started.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.600]   Here I go.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.520]   Right now, nothing's going to get in my way.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.880]   I'm not going to procrastinate, but first let me check email real quick."
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.360]   Right?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   That's a work-related task.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.600]   I'm being productive.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   I'm doing email.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   I got to do that at some point.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.760]   Or let me do that thing on my to-do list.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.120]   It's maybe not the top of my to-do list.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.720]   The most important thing, let me just get some stuff done just to get some momentum
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.960]   going.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.160]   Right?
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.040]   I'm still being productive.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.920]   And what I didn't realize is that that is the most dangerous, pernicious form of
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   distraction.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.680]   The distraction that tricks you into prioritizing the urgent and easy work at
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.160]   the expense of the hard and important work that we have to do to move our lives
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.320]   and our businesses forward.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.040]   So just because something is a work-related task doesn't mean it's not a
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.560]   distraction.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.280]   That is the worst kind of distraction because you don't even realize it's
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.960]   happening to you.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.600]   If it's not what you said you were going to do, it's a distraction.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.200]   Conversely, everything can be traction as long as you plan for it.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.520]   So don't believe these chicken little tech critics that tell you, "Oh,
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.600]   technology is hijacking your brain and social media is bad for you."
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's all rubbish.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.720]   It's ridiculous.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.400]   There's nothing wrong with going on Facebook or YouTube or Reddit or whatever
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.320]   you want to do with your time.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.440]   Video games.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.760]   Great.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.160]   Do it.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.560]   But do it on your schedule, not someone else's, not on the tech company's
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.880]   schedule.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.800]   Do it according to your values and your schedule.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.880]   Then it becomes traction because as Dorothy Parker said, "The time you plan
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.840]   to waste is not wasted time."
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   So as long as it's what you do with intent, with forethought, planned ahead,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.960]   you can enjoy it guilt-free.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.760]   As opposed to everything else that's not what you said you were going to do, that
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.480]   is a distraction.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.200]   So I want to dig into the root cause of this distraction.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.360]   But before, most people who write nonfiction books, their second book is
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   kind of the sequel of their first book.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.800]   And I'd love to understand how your journey came from writing a book about
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   building habits for products to helping people avoid the distractions that maybe
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.680]   and sometimes are those products that maybe built habits through some of the
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   tactics in your first book.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   In fact, when I pitched the book to my agent, she said, "Oh, okay.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   So now you're going to write unhooked."
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.840]   I said, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.000]   That's not the idea at all."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.960]   Because I still stand behind everything I wrote in Hooked, that we can build
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.440]   products that create healthy habits in users' lives.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.400]   And that's exactly what's happened since I've written Hooked.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.120]   You know, companies in every conceivable industry, Fitbot uses the Hooked model
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.720]   to get people hooked on exercise.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.760]   Kahoot uses the Hooked model to get kids hooked on to education.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.680]   We can use the Hooked model.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.440]   We can use the same techniques that the social media companies and the gaming
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.080]   companies use.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.800]   We can use those techniques to build healthy habits in our users' lives, no
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   matter the industry, right?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   If it's enterprise software, banking, healthcare, there's all kinds of
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   industries that apply the Hooked model for good.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   So if Hooked is about building good habits, Indistractable is about how do
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   we break bad habits.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.560]   But we can have our cake and eat it too, right?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   We want a language app to teach us the language, but we also don't want to
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.920]   overuse and distract ourselves with social media, and we want to use it
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.560]   responsibly.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.520]   So that's really where I'm coming from.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   Hooked is about building good habits, Indistractable is about breaking bad
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.880]   habits.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   They don't necessarily negate each other.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.680]   And was there a moment in time where you thought, "Okay, I have to write this
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.000]   book"?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.680]   Yeah, so for me, it was shortly after I wrote Hooked, and I was getting some
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.240]   notoriety.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.760]   I was getting a bunch of five-star reviews on Amazon, and I was doing
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.480]   speaking gigs and consulting engagements.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.360]   And I had this afternoon planned with my daughter.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.800]   Just some quality daddy-daughter time.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.760]   And I remember I had this book of activities that we could play together,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   you know, like do a Sudoku puzzle or a paper airplane contest, you know, things
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   like that.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   And one of the questions in the book that we were supposed to ask each other was,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.560]   "If you could have any superpower, what superpower would you want?"
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.600]   And I remember that question verbatim, but I can't tell you what my daughter
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:35.920]   said.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   Because in that instance, for whatever reason, I started checking my phone.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.480]   And when I looked up for my device, I realized that she was gone.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.720]   She got the message I was sending, which was that my phone was more important
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.320]   than she was.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.240]   And she left the room to play with some toy outside.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   And that's when I knew I had to figure this out.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.360]   Because look, I know these techniques and tricks from the inside, right?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.120]   I wrote the book Hooked.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.320]   I know exactly how they get you hooked.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.280]   And here I was getting distracted from one of the most important people in my
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.600]   life.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.160]   And so that was the turning point.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.800]   I said, "I got to figure this out for myself."
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   And of course, it wasn't just with her.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.840]   It was when I would tell myself, "Oh, I'm definitely going to exercise today."
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.200]   Right?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.480]   How many times have we told ourself that?
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.320]   And then we skip.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.400]   Or, "Oh, I'm certainly going to eat right."
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:18.720]   Right?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.120]   "Today's the day I'm going to eat healthfully."
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I would.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.520]   Or, "I'm definitely going to go to bed on time."
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.480]   Or, "I'm definitely going to work on that big project today."
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.560]   And somehow we don't do what we say we're going to do.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   So what I originally did, and I think a lot of people do, is I blamed the
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.760]   technology.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.000]   I thought, "Okay, maybe the technology is the problem."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.360]   Right?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.840]   Like that we just can't stop.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.280]   And so I took the, because that's what all the other books tell you to do.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.560]   Right?
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.160]   Like the, the digital detoxing and all that.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   And I kind of bought into that.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.360]   That was my knee-jerk reaction of, "Oh, the technology, it's evil.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.880]   They have a profit motive to capture your attention.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.960]   So I'll just stop using the technology."
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.040]   And I got myself a flip phone from Alibaba.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.560]   This 1990s looking phone that doesn't have, didn't have any apps, no internet
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.600]   connection, certainly no social media.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.000]   I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could write with no internet
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.480]   connection.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.000]   And I said, "Okay, great.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.960]   Now I'm off the technology, right?
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.080]   No internet connection.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.640]   I'm going to get started on my work.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.800]   Nothing's going to distract me.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   Except, uh, you see there's that book on the bookcase that I've been meaning to
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.600]   read.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.240]   Let me, let me just, let me just check that out real quick.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.600]   There's one chapter I wanted to read real quick.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.040]   Or, "Oh man, my desk is such a mess right now.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.280]   Let me just clean up my desk or the trash needs to be taken."
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I kept getting distracted because here's the thing.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.080]   My revelation was it's not the technology, right?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.200]   That you don't need the tech tools.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.240]   That's just the proximal cause.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.680]   It's not the root cause of the problem.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.840]   That in fact, when I started researching this topic, I found that Plato, the Greek
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.680]   philosopher, was struggling with distraction 2,500 years before the internet.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   People have always complained about distraction.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.880]   It was the television and the radio and the comic book and literally every
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.560]   technology.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.320]   People freak out.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.520]   They have a moral panic around and they blame the proximal cause as opposed to
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.600]   getting to the root cause.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   And so I, it didn't work for me to just get rid of the technology.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   Not only that, it's really easy for some professor in an ivory tower to say, stop
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.280]   using social media, but my livelihood depends on it.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.760]   And like, I can't do that.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   It's really easy to say, stop checking email.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.880]   Well, thanks, stupid.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   I'm going to get fired.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.080]   So that, that wasn't a good solution.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.440]   So I really wanted to figure out how we can enjoy these technologies, get the best
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.480]   out of them without letting them get the best of us.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.200]   I mean, I, we've all heard that technology is the problem, but what is the root
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.720]   cause?
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.200]   So the root cause is, uh, it's, it's a great question.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.320]   Cause you think about it, like, wait a minute, if we know what to do, why don't
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.880]   we just do it?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.560]   Especially in this day and age, right?
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   Who doesn't know how to lose weight?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.800]   Come on, find me a person who doesn't know that chocolate cake is not as healthy
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.920]   as a healthful salad.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.760]   We know you eat right.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.400]   You exercise.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.760]   Who doesn't know that to have better relationships, you have to spend quality
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.440]   time with the people you love without distraction.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:54.960]   We know this.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   Who doesn't know that if you want to be better at your job, you have to do the
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.440]   freaking work, right?
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   Especially the hard stuff that other people don't want to do.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.320]   We know.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.000]   And if you don't know, Google it, what's your excuse?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.440]   It's all there.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   So the problem is not that we don't know.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.040]   We know.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.640]   The problem is we don't know how to stop getting in our own way.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.240]   We don't know how to stop getting distracted.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.080]   And so to answer that question of why don't we do, we say we're going to do
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.920]   despite knowing what to do, we have to ask an even deeper question, which is why
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.640]   do we do everything?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   What's the nature of human motivation?
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   And this is something that I think most people, I certainly didn't understand
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.000]   fully that most of us have a messed up conception of what motivation is all
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.280]   about.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   If you ask the average person, how do you get others or yourself to do something?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.560]   What's the nature of human motivation?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   They're going to tell you what Sigmund Freud said, what Jeremy Bentham said,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.400]   which is the pleasure principle that everything we do is about the pursuit of
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.360]   pleasure and the avoidance of pain, right?
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.080]   Maybe they won't use that terminology.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.320]   They'll tell you carrots and sticks.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.080]   Basically, that's, that's what we've all been told.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.600]   Neurologically speaking, this is not true.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.320]   That motivation is not about carrots and sticks.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.360]   It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.600]   But actually, it's just one of those things that everything you do, everything
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.320]   you do is about the desire to escape discomfort.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.360]   That's it.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.640]   The desire to escape discomfort, all human motivation.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.760]   It's called the homeostatic response that if you think about this
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.280]   physiologically, that if you go outside and you're cold, then the brain says,
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.200]   Ooh, this doesn't feel good.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.920]   This is uncomfortable.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.640]   You should put on a coat.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.680]   If you walk back in, now you get too hot.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.880]   The brain says that doesn't feel good.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.440]   Take it off.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.480]   If you're hungry, you feel hunger pangs.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.920]   So you eat, and if you eat too much, oh, you feel stuffed.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.720]   The brain says, stop.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.560]   That doesn't feel good either.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   So physiologically, this is common sense.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.760]   The same holds true psychologically.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.160]   That if you feel lonely, check Facebook.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.680]   If you are uncertain, Google it before you scan your brain to see if you know
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.440]   the answer, you're automatically Googling it.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   If you're feeling bored, lots of solutions for boredom, right?
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.080]   You can check stock prices, sports scores.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.240]   Oh, let's worry about somebody's problems 3,000 miles away by tuning
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.120]   into the news so that we don't have to think about what's going on in our own head.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.280]   And do you think people know that they have this pain all the time or
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.120]   is sometimes this discomfort unknown?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.320]   No, no, no.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.080]   We almost never realize that that's what's driving our behavior, even though it is.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.320]   That that desire to escape discomfort is what gets us to do everything we do.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.800]   Even people are probably saying, well, yeah, but what about the pursuit of pleasure?
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.680]   What about feeling good?
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.760]   Well, even the desire to feel good, what drives us to get that pleasure is desire,
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.080]   craving, lusting, which is itself psychologically destabilizing.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.680]   So even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the brain spurs us to action
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.880]   by making us feel bad enough to go get that thing we want to acquire or feel.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.720]   Right.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.680]   So all human behavior stems from a desire to escape discomfort.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.560]   And once you understand that, what that therefore must mean is that
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.160]   time management is pain management.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.720]   Let me say it again.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.480]   Time management is pain management.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.320]   So none of the tips and tricks and techniques.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.560]   Look, I spent five years researching and writing this book, and I've looked
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.280]   at all the literature virtually, right?
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.640]   I've read all the books on time management.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.320]   And I will tell you, none of the techniques work, none of the tips and
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.280]   tricks and gurus and life hacks, none of that stuff works if you don't first
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.920]   understand what is the discomfort driving you to distraction, that distraction,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.440]   procrastination, it's not a character flaw.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.240]   There's nothing wrong with you, right?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.440]   People love to moralize and medicalize this topic.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.160]   The vast majority of people, there's nothing wrong with you.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.480]   It's simply that we haven't learned how to deal with discomfort.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   And so once you learn that, once you do what I call master the internal
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.240]   triggers, they no longer become your master.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.000]   So that's the first step to becoming indistractable is
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.360]   mastering the internal triggers.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.880]   The second step is about making time for traction.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.760]   We talked about that earlier.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.640]   Traction is any action that pulls you towards what you said you were going to do.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.360]   So, you know, there's some very simple things that all of us can do to make
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.800]   sure we make time for traction in our day.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   The third step is to hack back what we call the external triggers.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.760]   The external triggers, this is what people tend to blame.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.560]   It's the pings, the dings, the rings, anything in your outside
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.360]   environment, like you said, that that can move you towards distraction.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.840]   Studies find, however, that that's only 10% of the time that we get distracted.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.800]   Is it because of something in our external environment?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.280]   So the other 90% of the time, 90% is not about what's happening outside of us.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.800]   It's about what's happening inside of us.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.880]   But there are still things we can do to hack back those external triggers.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   So that's step three, step four.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.400]   And the final step is to prevent distraction with pacts.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.520]   And so it's when we use these four steps in concert, this is how
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.160]   anyone can become indistractable.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   So I'd love to dig in on the four steps.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.680]   When I read the book this week, and it was fantastic, by the way, to anyone
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.400]   listening, definitely pick up a copy.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.960]   But I had a few questions that I'd love to talk about.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.040]   So I'll start with step one, mastering the internal triggers.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.800]   When you feel an urge to be distracted, you talk about pausing
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.400]   to explore that distraction.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.080]   But what's the end goal of better understanding that feeling when
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.120]   you're about to get distracted?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.560]   It's about having arrows in your quiver ready, so that when you feel that
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.480]   discomfort, it's not, you know, oh, meditate about it, right?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.680]   Sometimes you need to get off your butt and stop meditating and take action.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.120]   And so what I advise people is to have tools ready at their disposal so
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.480]   that when they feel that discomfort, they know in advance what
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.560]   they are going to do with it.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.000]   You know, there's this myth around visualization.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.400]   We've all heard that if you want to achieve your dreams, you have
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.440]   to visualize your goals, right?
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.400]   If you want to get in shape, you want to visualize yourself with a beach body.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.520]   If you want to be wealthy, you have to visualize yourself in a Lamborghini or
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.000]   some other materialistic crap, right?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.360]   Turns out that stuff doesn't work.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.320]   That visualization of end goals actually backfires.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.520]   It makes it less likely for you to achieve your goal because you're giving
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.920]   yourself the pleasure of having it without actually doing anything for it.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.960]   In your mind.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   So that kind of visualization doesn't work.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.680]   What does work is, and this has been shown in studies, that visualizing what
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.880]   you will do when you are tempted, when you are tempted to go off track.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.360]   So if you have an aspiration to lose weight, for example, don't
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.800]   visualize the beach body, visualize what you will do when someone offers
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.080]   you chocolate cake at a dinner party and you want to refuse, what are you going to say?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.880]   What preparation will you take now so that you know what to do tomorrow?
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.320]   So one of the most important lessons of the book is this mantra that I repeat to
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.440]   myself every day, which is that the antidote to impulsiveness is forethought.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.360]   Let me say it again.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.280]   The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.800]   So distraction, procrastination is all about impulsiveness, right?
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.200]   It's that we know what to do long-term, but in the moment, we don't do it, right?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.000]   We do something else.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.920]   So the antidote is forethought.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.000]   So that if you can plan today for what you will do tomorrow, there is no
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.560]   distraction that you can't overcome because if you wait to the last minute,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.400]   right, if you wait till the chocolate cake is on its way to your mouth, you're
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:48.880]   going to eat it.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.040]   If you wait till the cigarette is in your hand, you're going to smoke it.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.080]   If you sleep next to your cell phone every night, of course, you're going to
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.240]   pick it up first thing in the morning before you even say hello to your loved
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.840]   ones because it's too late.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.520]   You've lost.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.400]   They're going to get you.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.840]   You have to plan ahead.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.560]   So when it comes to these internal triggers, the strategy is to know what
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   you will do when you feel boredom, loneliness, uncertainty, stress, anxiety,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.120]   fatigue, what are you going to do?
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.800]   Are you going to do what most people do, which is trying to escape that
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.560]   discomfort with too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:18.960]   Facebook.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.240]   There's 100 different ways to distract your attention away from what you said
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.600]   you were going to do, or are you going to use that discomfort as rocket fuel to
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.120]   propel you towards traction as opposed to succumbing to distraction?
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.840]   And there's all kinds of different tools.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.520]   There's all kinds of different arrows in your quiver that you can use so that
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.520]   when you feel that discomfort, you will know what to do with it.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.600]   So it's funny, my wife and I have a challenge, which is she has a lot of
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.560]   self-control over kind of urges, especially around health things, right?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.000]   If she bakes, you know, two dozen cookies, she has no problem just leaving
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.680]   them on the counter.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.960]   Ugh, I can't stand those people.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.040]   I know, I know.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.800]   My solution is I'm really good at the grocery store saying, let's just not buy
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.280]   cookies.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   Like, let's not buy the ingredients for you to bake.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.320]   And she's like, well, baking's therapy, so I want to bake.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.160]   And I'm like, well, could you just bake one cookie?
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.360]   She's like, well, if I'm going to go through all this effort, I might as well
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.320]   bake two dozen cookies.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.560]   And so one of the things I tried this week was, you know, you mentioned the
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.400]   surfing the urge, which I just wanted to share, like, for people out there in my
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   situation, I said, you know what, anytime I see this cookie on the counter, now
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   that it's baked, I lose all self-control.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.520]   But so I told myself, okay, every time I want a cookie, I can have one if I just
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.280]   wait 10 minutes.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.880]   And you know, you said earlier, it's hard to wait till the last minute.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.120]   But even in the last minute, I found a few tactics that were very effective,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.680]   obviously way more effective for me to just not have the cookies in the house.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.120]   But that tactic of waiting for 10 minutes made me realize, oh, I have control over
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.080]   not eating this cookie.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.640]   Now after 10 minutes, I don't want it.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.440]   And that was fantastic.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:46.720]   Right.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   So so yeah, so not having the cookie in the house would be an example of hacking
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.320]   back the external trigger, which is great.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.200]   But the world is full of external triggers, right?
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.160]   So you can't swear off technology, the trigger will be there.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.720]   Now there's some things you can do to remove some external triggers, right?
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.080]   You can remove certain apps from your phone, you can turn off notifications,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.040]   things like that, okay, fine, but there will always be certain temptations.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.760]   So what do you do in the moment, what you did, actually, you use forethought, you
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.240]   said, next time that I have this urge, I'm going to use the 10 minute rule.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.760]   And so the 10 minute rule is one of dozens of different techniques we can use.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   And so the 10 minute rule basically says that I can give into that distraction,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.720]   whether it's eating the cookie or smoking a cigarette or scrolling the internet,
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.920]   whatever the case might be, but not right now, in 10 minutes, right?
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.160]   So what you're doing is you're building self efficacy, you're showing yourself,
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.840]   wait a minute, I can wait a few minutes, just 10 minutes, you're not telling
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.040]   yourself no, because in fact, we know that abstinence can oftentimes backfire,
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.360]   that telling yourself don't do something only makes you want it more with with
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.440]   many behaviors, instead of saying no, you're telling yourself not yet.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.960]   And so then the 10 minute rule becomes the 11 minute rule, the 12 minute rule,
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.680]   the 15 minute rule.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.720]   And so you're able to build that self efficacy to not get distracted later on.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.800]   But there is no magic bullet, people always want, tell me the one thing I need
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.200]   to do.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   And it's and when you look at the research literature, it's not just about
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:04.960]   one thing.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.880]   It's these four things in concert, right?
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.240]   It's knowing, okay, what am I going to do that internal trigger?
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.880]   How do I make time for traction?
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.720]   When is it okay for me to eat that cookie, right?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.680]   Maybe there's a time when it and a place where it is okay.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.160]   And you have that planned ahead, removing the external triggers, hacking back the
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.440]   external triggers, and then preventing distraction with packs.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.040]   What many people do is that they exert some kind of contract with themselves or
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.320]   with somebody else to make sure they don't go off track.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.440]   So these four techniques in concert is really what's essential.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.040]   Yeah, you started with saying earlier that to do lists are kind of the worst.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   And I'm curious, you know, making time for traction and being kind of
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.040]   intentional is great.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.640]   To do lists, my understanding from the book, you know, it's just a list of
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.480]   things, but there's no kind of firm commitment.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.360]   Is it the to do list that you hate?
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.600]   Or is it the fact that most to do lists don't actually have timing when and where
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   and how in it?
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.120]   And if a to do list did have all those things, and, and you kind of archived
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.200]   everything that didn't have that filled out, would you like to do this again?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.520]   Yeah, so there's nothing wrong with writing things down, right, getting things
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.600]   out of your head and putting them on a piece of paper or, or an app.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.560]   That's a great idea.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.520]   What most people do, however, is that they run their life on a to do list, they wake
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.360]   up in the morning, and they say, What am I supposed to do today?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.560]   Oh, let me look at my to do list.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.240]   And they start ticking off little cute boxes.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.720]   That's terrible.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.560]   Because if you wake up in the morning, and you look at your to do list, before you
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.280]   look at your calendar, you have already lost, you made a big mistake.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.960]   Principally, the big problem with to do list is that there's no constraints, you
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.080]   can always add more to a to do list, right?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.800]   It's never ending.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.360]   Whereas with a calendar with a timebox calendar, which is what I'm a big
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.160]   proponent of and what the studies find are turned out to tell people be much more
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.680]   productive and effective in their days and do what they say they're going to do.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.520]   There is a constraint, the same 24 hours that we all have in a day.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.480]   So it's not a coincidence when you think about how we use the same language with
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.320]   time as we do with money, right?
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.240]   You pay attention, you make money just like you make time.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.920]   So there's lots of terminology that's the same.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.160]   And yet we're so cheap with our money, right?
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.960]   We scrimp and save and people won't pay 99 cents for an app.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.880]   And we split our checks with our friends when we go out to lunch, like we're so
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.680]   cheap with money.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.880]   But we give our time to whoever wants it.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.760]   And it should be exactly the opposite, right?
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.640]   That we you can always make more money.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.320]   So you should be generous with your money.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.640]   You should be stingy with your time, because you can't make more time, we all
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.920]   get the same 24 hours in the day.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.200]   So by having a constraint on your time by deciding in advance, okay, I only have
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.160]   this much time in my day, how am I going to spend it according to my values?
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.520]   How can I turn my values into time?
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.880]   Now we impose those constraints, we force that decision.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.920]   And so that helps us decide for the first time in many people's life, what is
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.440]   traction?
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.520]   You know, I meet with so many people who tell me how distracted they are.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.080]   And I say, well, well, what did you get distracted from?
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   Show me your schedule.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   And there's a bunch of white space.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.560]   Well, wait a minute, how can you say you got distracted from something if you
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.200]   didn't know what you got distracted from?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.120]   Right?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.200]   If you can't see in your calendar, what is traction, you can't define
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.160]   distraction.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.360]   So that's why it's one of the reasons that that timebox calendars are so much
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.920]   more effective than to do list.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:11.960]   Another big reason this is probably even the more important reason is that to do
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.520]   list reinforce a negative self identity, meaning, you know, this happened to me
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.480]   all the time, I call this the tyranny of the to do list, I would come home from
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.320]   work, and it'd be a hard day, I'd feel exhausted.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.960]   And so man, I'm so busy today.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   And then I look at my to do list and see, you know, what I still didn't finish.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.680]   And there were still 100 things on that to do list that I didn't do.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:34.040]   And so day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, I was
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.560]   reinforcing that I wasn't doing what I said I was going to do, loser.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.440]   And so over time, you begin to believe this, this stupid narrative that, oh, I
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.280]   must not be very good with time management.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.200]   Right?
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.320]   Maybe I have an attention problem, maybe there's something wrong with me that I
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.400]   can't finish this stuff.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.920]   And for the vast majority of people, there's nothing wrong with them.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.080]   It's just that they haven't learned the proper techniques to make sure that they
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   follow through on what they say they're going to do.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.960]   So that's why calendars beat to do lists by far.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.320]   And it's funny, you know, whenever I used to tell the story, somebody would say,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   well, what about Mark Andreessen?
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.360]   Mark Andreessen wrote a famous story, you know, Mark, well, yeah, you know, he
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.880]   wrote a famous blog post about how he he leaves his days open, right?
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.120]   He wants to be spontaneous.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.520]   And then I just saw a couple months ago, that he changed his mind.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.280]   But now he shared an interview, his time box calendar.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.360]   And I yes, I was so happy to see that.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.560]   You won him over.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   Yeah, well, I don't know if I did, but he changed his ways, which is fantastic.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.280]   And does that mean that if I, you know, if you shared your calendar, it would be
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.120]   fully scheduled, you know, including sleeping 24/7 the whole week?
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.960]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   Yeah, no space for distraction, you know, or I guess you can have intentional
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.360]   distraction, but you can have diversion.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   So there's so distraction is never good.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.160]   Okay, distraction is always when you don't do what you said you're going to do.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.120]   Now, you can get diverted.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.080]   A diversion is very different from a distraction.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.760]   A diversion is a refocusing of attention.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.720]   So last night, I went to go see Dune, right?
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.360]   I went to go see a movie with with my friend and with my daughter.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.040]   And that was a diversion of attention.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.120]   I paid to go to a movie theater and have my attention diverted from real life into
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.080]   this fictional world.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:10.640]   It's fun.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.160]   It's great.
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.080]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.120]   But guess what?
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.280]   That time was in my calendar.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.400]   I knew that that's what I was gonna do.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.920]   So you can to have time for prayer for meditation for spontaneity, right?
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.080]   It sounds like an oxymoron.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.280]   I have planned spontaneity in my calendar.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.040]   So every Saturday afternoon, I spend time with my daughter.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.280]   We call it that time plan spontaneity.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.880]   Why?
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.080]   Because I don't know what we're gonna do.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.120]   We might go to the park, we might go get ice cream, we might go take a walk, we
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:34.840]   don't know what we're gonna do.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.600]   But I know what I will not do at that time.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.120]   And that's why I booked that time in advance.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.360]   I will not be checking my phone, I will not be taking work calls, I will not be on
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.080]   social media, because I have planned ahead that my daughter is the person who I will
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.000]   devote that time to.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.640]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.160]   And do you ever just change plans?
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.960]   Is that is that okay in this kind of world of, I was supposed to do this thing, and I
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.640]   just had a really long day, and I don't want to do it anymore.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.160]   But I'm choosing not to do it.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.920]   Not in the moment.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.200]   Okay, so that if you give it in the moment, then that's an impulsivity problem.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.480]   But you can reset the day for the day ahead.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.840]   Okay, once you set that schedule, stick with it, right?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.040]   Even if you go off track, you don't have to think about what should I do next, you
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.840]   just go to the next thing on your calendar, you follow the plan once you make that
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.160]   plan.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.760]   Right?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.560]   So as much as possible, you don't divert from it.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.600]   Now, do we make mistakes?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.680]   Of course, I still get distracted from time to time.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.480]   The difference is that an indistractable person knows why they made that mistake,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.520]   why they got distracted, they do something about it.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.440]   So Paolo Coelho has a wonderful quote, he said, a mistake repeated more than once is
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.000]   a decision.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.000]   How many times do we get distracted by the same frickin things before we say, Wait a
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.640]   minute, wait a minute, okay, how many times can we blame social media?
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.080]   How many times can we blame email?
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.520]   How many times can we blame the news?
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.320]   How many times can we blame Netflix before we say, stop?
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.080]   Okay, you're I get what you're doing to me, of course, they want your attention.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.480]   Are you going to just let them keep taking your attention or your time?
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.160]   Are you going to do something about it?
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.800]   So a distractible person through their actions is deciding to be distractible because they
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   keep getting distracted by the same thing again and again and again.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.560]   Unless, you know, little asterisks, if there's some kind of medical disorder, which about
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.400]   one to 3% of the population has ADHD.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   Okay, fine, there's an exception there, perhaps.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.360]   For the vast majority of us, 97, 99% of the population, we are deciding to be distractible.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   Whereas an indistractable person says, Okay, I see what you did there.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.560]   Now I'm going to do something about it.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.920]   I'm going to figure out what internal trigger prompted me to get distracted.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.040]   I'm going to make time for traction.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.520]   I'm going to hack back the external triggers and I'm going to prevent distraction with
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.440]   PAX so that it doesn't happen again.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.800]   It seems like with every business you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.440]   emerge.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.640]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual processes
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.800]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.760]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.120]   37,000, 25, 1.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   37,000, that's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.320]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.480]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.360]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.400]   25.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.240]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.520]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.600]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.360]   And 1.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.840]   Because your business is one of a kind, so you get a customized solution for all your
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.080]   KPIs in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.600]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.480]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the companies
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.200]   I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:05.360]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:05.920]   for you.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.720]   And nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.960]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.600]   it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.240]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.520]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic mold
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.360]   commonly found in plants.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.240]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.920]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel friendly.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.480]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart digestion and
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.400]   metabolism with a rich earthy flavor that is so good, and probably one of my favorite
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.520]   things to drink.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.360]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research backed benefits of
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.240]   polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be happy that
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:12.640]   Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers free
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.680]   U.S. shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:26.160]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea samples

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:43.040]   Yeah, and that next section that we didn't really talk much, while it falls so in line
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.240]   with the show, right, where all the hacks, like that is what people, you know, come here
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.040]   to hear.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.840]   There's eight chapters that talk all about different triggers, external triggers, like
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.040]   email and group chat.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.840]   I don't want to just run through the list because there's literally a book where you
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   could buy it and run through that list.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:03.280]   My favorite was something I tried doing today, which was I started sending all my emails
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.360]   up until like four or five o'clock.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.040]   I just scheduled to send it five o'clock so that I wasn't getting all the replies during
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.440]   the day.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.320]   I wasn't distracted.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.520]   It was kind of planning ahead.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.160]   I didn't know if there was one in that list that you want to flag as something you thought
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.960]   was kind of unique or something most people don't know about and you'd share.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.240]   Sure.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.600]   So that's the most kind of nuts and bolts chapter of the book, where we actually go
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.960]   through all the potential external triggers that people encounter.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.640]   So we talk about how simple stuff like your phone, you know, two-thirds of people with
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   a smartphone never change their notification settings.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.160]   That's, come on, that's kindergarten stuff.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.600]   Of course, you change your notification settings.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:39.920]   Can we really complain that phones are addicting us and hijacking our brains if we haven't
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.000]   changed the stupid notification settings?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.360]   That's, that's easy stuff.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.040]   But the stuff that people don't think about, it's the stuff like meetings.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.720]   How many meetings do we go to that are a complete distraction from what we really need to be
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.000]   doing with our time and our attention?
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.160]   Group chat, right?
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.280]   People struggle with Slack or other group messaging services.
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.760]   Email.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.960]   Oh my God, email.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.320]   The email was, was when we did surveys, the number one distraction that the average knowledge
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.080]   worker faced, by the way, number one before COVID was other people.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.160]   That was the number one distraction in the workplace.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.120]   That was number one.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.560]   Number two was email.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.480]   And so there's all kinds of things we can do to hack back email that using these techniques
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:21.520]   of folks that reported saving 90% up to 90% of the time they spent on email, they no longer
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.080]   spend.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.360]   And there's all kinds of things we can do.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.160]   I'll give you, I'll give you one quick hack for this.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.280]   So the idea here, what we find in terms of, of when you look at where people waste time
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.920]   on email, it's not the replying.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.600]   It's the checking and specifically the rechecking.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.880]   That's where we waste time on email.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.600]   What does that look like?
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.880]   Well, you get an email, you know, you get this notification on your phone, you open
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.840]   the email, you read it, you put it away, you open the next email, you read it, you put
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.320]   it away.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.160]   Then you say, wait, what was that in that email again?
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.080]   So like 20 minutes later, you check it again.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.080]   And then, uh, you know, six hours later you check it again, but you're not taking action
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.480]   on it.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.680]   So that's where people tend to waste the most time on email is the checking and the
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:58.560]   rechecking.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.080]   So what you want to do from now on is you want to label emails.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.000]   And if you don't know how to label emails, just Google it.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.080]   Every email service provider will let you do this.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.920]   You want to label emails, not by topic.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.440]   Most people use labels by topic.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.800]   That's the wrong way to use labels.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.120]   What you want to do is to label emails by the most important factor from a time management
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.680]   perspective, which is when does it need a reply?
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.520]   When does it need a reply?
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.160]   So if an email, uh, is, oh my God, your house is on fire.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.680]   You have to reply right now.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's about less than 1% of emails are actually super urgent, right?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.160]   Because if your house is on fire, somebody's not going to email you.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.360]   They're going to call you or do, you know, find or reach you, trying to reach you another
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   way.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.920]   If it is absolutely super urgent, 1% of emails, okay, you can respond in the moment.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.440]   But everything else, 99% of other emails do not respond in the email.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.880]   You know, some people think, okay, if something takes less than two minutes, just do it.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:47.840]   That's a bad rule.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.920]   And that was, that's an antiquated rule because look, most emails take less than two minutes.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   But when you get a hundred emails per day, well, that's a lot of time if each one takes
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.800]   two minutes.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.560]   So the rest of your emails tend to fall into a few different categories.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.800]   The first is if it's something that never needs a reply, okay, a spam or whatever.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.760]   Well, that's easy.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.360]   Just archive it or delete it.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:12.160]   The rest of your emails fall into two categories, things that you need to reply to today and
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.640]   things that you can reply to sometime this week.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.320]   So everything needs a reply to today.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.680]   When you first check that email, you label it as today.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:19.920]   Okay.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.880]   And then you put it away.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.120]   Okay.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.840]   Just label us today.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.320]   Put it away.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.600]   The emails that you need to reply to sometime this week, same thing.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.720]   You label it as this week and you put it away.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.080]   Now, the goal is that every email you touch, you only touch twice.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.800]   Once when you label, the second time when you return, when you reply.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:41.680]   Then you go back to your time box calendar and you have time in your day to reply to
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.960]   only urgent emails, only the emails they need to reply to today.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.120]   Statistically, it's about 20% of your emails.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.680]   The rest of your emails, the other 80% are emails that don't need to reply today.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.960]   They need to reply sometime this week and you schedule time in your calendar for that.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.800]   So for me, it's message Mondays.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.960]   Every Monday, I have a three-hour block of time when I run through all those emails that
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.440]   can wait.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.600]   Now, you say, "Well, where is the time saving?"
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:03.840]   Right?
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.800]   Where am I saving time here?
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.280]   Here's the thing.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.960]   Most people play email ping pong.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.040]   Email ping pong is when you get an email, you send an email.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.160]   You get an email, you send an email.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.760]   It goes back and forth and back and forth.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.000]   And they do this without necessarily prioritizing what's urgent and what can wait.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.400]   And there's a magical thing that happens when you let emails simmer.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.920]   About half of those 80% of your emails that need to reply sometime this week, half of
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.480]   them will no longer need to reply.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:30.800]   Why?
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.360]   How does that happen?
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.080]   What's this magic?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.000]   Turns out people figure out their own stuff, right?
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.840]   Something that was urgent earlier is no longer urgent because it got crushed under the weight
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.040]   of some other priority.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.480]   So when you let the emails that don't need to reply today just simmer for a little bit,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.000]   just let people figure it out on their own for a little bit and don't reply impulsively
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.280]   based on what's at the top of your to-do list or what's at the top of your email inbox
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.880]   or what's easiest to reply to.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.840]   And just let them simmer.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.600]   What you will find is that you'll get a dramatic reduction in the number of emails that actually
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.440]   even need a reply in the first place.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.960]   Furthermore, you won't be checking email all day long anymore.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.600]   What many people don't realize is that they do what's called context switching.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.320]   They work on a big project and then they check email and they work on something else and
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.120]   they check email and they're constantly checking email all day long because they're worried
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.960]   there might actually be something urgent.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.880]   As opposed to saying, look, I check my email twice a day.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.560]   Okay, check in the morning, check in the evening.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.120]   That's it.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:19.840]   That's it.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.720]   So the rest of the day, I can work without distraction.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.280]   I can be indistractable knowing, okay, I'm going to look back at my email inbox at another
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:27.440]   time.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.480]   By the way, it doesn't have to be twice a day.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.120]   It can be three times a day, four times a day, but plan it ahead.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.680]   Put it in your calendar so you're not doing it, which is how most people check email when
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.520]   they feel uncertainty, right?
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   They feel that internal trigger of what am I supposed to do?
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:39.840]   I don't know.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.360]   Let me go check my email inbox.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.120]   So my email inbox will tell me what to do.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.640]   Well, that's a terrible way to run your life.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:49.120]   And there's a side benefit, which is a lot of times we all run to our inbox, refresh,
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.160]   see what's there.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.840]   The longer you wait between refreshes, the higher the likelihood that some email that
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.520]   you're actually excited about, that's actually important to your life is sitting there.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.680]   And so I've actually found the less I check my email, the more I feel good getting to
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.640]   my email versus going there for just one email.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.840]   It's just not worth it.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.080]   And then I know we both worked in tech.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.240]   I'm sure you know the concept of rubber duck debugging, but it reminded me of what you
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.280]   just said, which is, you know, engineers would have a rubber duck that you could talk to
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.880]   to try to solve an engineering problem.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.440]   And so at my last startup, I gave everyone this little small duck to put on their desk
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   and I didn't actually expect them to speak out loud to solve their problem with the duck.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.080]   But it was more of a signal of, "Hey, you could probably think about this and maybe
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:32.560]   solve it."
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:38.640]   And I didn't do any quantitative measurements, but I want to say at least 10% of pings and
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.560]   questions and things went down because it was just a symbol of, "Hey, could you solve
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.320]   this if you just thought about it for a few minutes?"
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.520]   Oh my gosh.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.080]   And so what you're doing by saying, "Look, I don't check email every 30 seconds.
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.720]   I actually plan my time to check email."
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.400]   What you're doing is training your colleagues to think for themselves, right?
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.560]   You're actually, that's part of the company culture that you're changing.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.880]   You know, there's a whole section in the book on how to build an indistractable workplace.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.320]   And so one of the things that we can do, certainly if you're in a position of leadership,
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.440]   but all of us, you know, by exemplifying what it means to be indistractable, we're actually
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.400]   promoting this culture of helping people work without distraction.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.840]   So doing things like that, right?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.240]   Telling people, "Look, this is when I'm available."
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   Then they are prompted to think for themselves as opposed to, it's just so easy to be like,
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.240]   "Hey, answer this stupid question for me so I don't have to think."
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.640]   You know, people are cognitive misers, all of us.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.640]   We don't like to expend energy thinking.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.360]   So when you add a bit of friction to contacting you,
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.320]   you get people to actually think for themselves and planning that time to think.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.480]   This is super important for yourself as well.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.360]   I mean, for all of us.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   There are two kinds of work.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.560]   There is what we call reactive work and reflective work.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.160]   Reactive work is reacting to the emails, reacting to notifications,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.440]   having some kind of external factor tell us what to do with our time.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.840]   And most people live their entire life that way.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.120]   Certainly their work life.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.840]   They love being told what to do because thinking is hard work.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.760]   They just do reactive work all day long.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.400]   Those tend to be low performers.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.760]   High performers make time in their day to think.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.520]   They do what we call reflective work.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.440]   Reflective work is the kind of work that can only be done without distraction.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.320]   Thinking, strategizing, planning can only be done when you are focused.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.880]   So you have to plan at least some time in your day.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.600]   It doesn't have to be your whole day, but 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.280]   an hour of your day has to be set aside for working without distraction,
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.640]   doing that reflective work.
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.080]   If you don't, you're going to run real fast in the wrong direction.
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:29.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.800]   It's hard to block time in your calendar for just thinking.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.880]   It seems so counterintuitive to productivity.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.600]   But when I was running my last company, it was like, you just have to do it.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.400]   Otherwise, you just will never, you'll never make time for that.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.480]   I have, I have what I'll call a burning question.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.720]   It'll make sense in a moment on this last category of preventing distraction with packs.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.560]   So I was reading through it.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.880]   And the thing that really hit me was this burn or burn calendar you have.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.440]   And so for anyone listening, you create a calendar of things you want to do.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.040]   In your case, it was exercise.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.000]   And you taped a $100 bill and said, "If I don't do this thing that I said,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.320]   I'm going to light... I have to light the $100 bill on fire."
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.480]   And for so long, I've heard all these price-based packs where you...
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.120]   Gym packed and you have to pay $1 if you don't go to the gym.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.440]   And none of them felt as visceral as lighting $100 bill on fire.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.120]   But it also seemed so, you know, of course, I can commit to working out.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.200]   So I would do this and if I could hold myself to it.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.720]   So I'm curious, did you ever have to burn the $100 bill?
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.320]   - So the reason this technique is so effective,
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.040]   and by the way, this isn't something I just made up out of thin air.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.520]   This is actually, it comes from the most effective smoking cessation study in history, right?
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.920]   So the most effective study ever conducted on how to get people to stop smoking
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.400]   was one where people had to put in $150 at stake,
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.080]   that if they didn't smoke for six months as verified by urinalysis,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.320]   they got the $150 back.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.240]   That turned out to be more effective than patches and gums and therapy
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.440]   and all the other smoking cessation programs for this thing that we think,
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.880]   "Oh my God, cigarettes are so addictive."
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.720]   Well, it turns out you can buy breaking that addiction with as little as $150.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.760]   How crazy is that?
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.040]   And so that's where this idea came from for this burn or burn technique.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.640]   I want to say as a disclaimer real quick,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.680]   you have to do this last, okay?
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.640]   You have to do this last.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.800]   If you jump to do this, it oftentimes will backfire
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   because if you haven't prepared yourself for how to master the internal triggers,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.880]   making time for traction, hacking back the external triggers,
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.600]   and you fall off the horse, it becomes really, really tough to get back on it, okay?
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.720]   So this is where you can, I can't emphasize this enough,
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.000]   you have to do this after you've done the other three techniques first.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.280]   But once you've done that, it can be an incredibly effective technique.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   So there's different kinds of packs, effort packs, price packs, and identity packs.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   What you're mentioning is a price pack.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.840]   And yeah, for me, I knew I needed to exercise.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.720]   I didn't really like it, but I just needed to do it, right?
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:54.160]   So what I did was I took this calendar, I taped it to my wall.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.320]   And every day, there's a $100 bill taped to it.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.920]   And I've been using this technique for, what, three and a half, four years now.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.200]   I'm 43 years old.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.040]   I'm in the best shape of my life.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.720]   I used to be clinically obese.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.640]   Today, I'm not saying this to brag because I don't think I have any good genes or anything.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.480]   It's just that I do this because I intentionally do what I say I'm going to do.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.200]   If I say I'm going to exercise, I want to actually do it.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.680]   And so by having that $100 bill that I stare at every day,
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.120]   and knowing if, hey, if I don't do some kind of physical exercise,
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   and you know, what you do is up to you.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.040]   For me, it's do 20 push-ups, go on a quick run, take a walk around the block,
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.880]   do something physical every single day.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.320]   If I don't do it, I burn the money.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.440]   And I'm happy to report to you that after, what, three and a half, four years now,
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.560]   I've never had to burn the money.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.200]   Why?
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.080]   Because when I look at it, I say, oh, okay, fine.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.000]   Let me just do some push-ups real quick.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.520]   Let me just go take a quick walk.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.840]   And so it's that pact that I made with myself.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.880]   And of course, could I cheat?
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.080]   Yeah, of course I could cheat.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.320]   But what's my integrity worth to myself, right?
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.720]   Could I look at myself in the mirror knowing I cheated?
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.600]   No, that's why that pact works.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.200]   But again, you have to do this after you've done the other three steps first.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.400]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.520]   For me, I did one once where it was donate to charity.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.360]   And it was like, for any day you didn't go to the gym,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   you had to donate $5 to charity.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.320]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.480]   Donating $5 to charity is not that big of a deal.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.160]   - That's right, that's why that doesn't work.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.960]   - And then I thought about what it would take to burn a $100 bill.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.560]   And I was like, I mean, this has to work.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.320]   'Cause I would never, I couldn't possibly do that.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.360]   It would drive me crazy.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.640]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.680]   So yeah, having that visceral reaction of, ah, it's right there.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   Can't you just go do some push-ups, silly?
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.040]   Just do it.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.360]   It makes it much more likely that you'll follow through.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.640]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.480]   And Trade Coffee is a great addition to your new year routine.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.960]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.240]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.360]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.600]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.480]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.920]   so you can enjoy their craft from the comfort of your own home
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.040]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.080]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.360]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.000]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.160]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.480]   just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.600]   And over the past year,
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.400]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.560]   But this last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.120]   it's called Bark the Moon, and it's so delicious.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.120]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.960]   with select subscription plans
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.640]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.360]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.080]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.400]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.640]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:46.800]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.120]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.640]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.960]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.560]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from AnyDay,
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.000]   I'm a total convert
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.240]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.040]   AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.240]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.440]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.040]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.440]   The cookware is 100% plastic-free
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:20.240]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.840]   all in the same dish
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.280]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.040]   And if you need a recipe suggestion
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.800]   to kick off your AnyDay adventure,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.600]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:32.880]   It is so good.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.960]   And if you haven't checked out
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.160]   the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.920]   you have to check it out.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:43.280]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,

[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.440]   (air whooshing)
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.800]   I just want to thank you, Quick,

[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.120]   I want to ask a little bit about relationships.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.040]   And if you have a partner
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.200]   and you want to kind of bring this to light
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.120]   and you want to start talking about this,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.320]   do you have to do it together?
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.400]   Is it something that can be a problem
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.440]   if one person is like,
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.520]   "I really want to be indistractable."
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.560]   And the other person's like,
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.480]   "You know what? I'm not that big of a...
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.240]   It's fine. I'm fine without doing this."
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.120]   Yeah, so I'm not a big proponent
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.920]   of intentionally seeking to change people.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.520]   That there's a psychological quirk
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.200]   that we all have called reactance.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.840]   And reactance says that when we are told what to do,
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.520]   we tend to rebel.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.440]   And we all feel this to some degree.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.600]   That if your mom ever told you
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.760]   to take your umbrella because it's going to rain,
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.200]   "Don't tell me what to do. I'll figure it out."
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.360]   Or if your boss micromanages you.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.080]   Nobody likes that.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.600]   We hate being told what to do.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.040]   So intentionally going and saying,
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.080]   "Hey, honey, guess what?
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.920]   We're going to become indistractable now."
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.400]   Right? That won't work.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   The best thing to do is to lead by example.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.520]   That most of us,
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.320]   whether it's with helping our kids be indistractable,
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.520]   helping our spouses,
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.000]   or helping our colleagues at work be indistractable,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.960]   the best thing you can do is to be indistractable yourself.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.400]   Especially when it comes to our kids.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   Because kids come installed
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.760]   with what I call hypocrisy detection devices.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.680]   I talk to parents all the time and say,
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.360]   "Oh, my kid won't stop playing Fortnite."
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.960]   Or they're always on social media.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.240]   And while they're telling me this,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.840]   they're checking email on their phone.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.360]   So we can't be hypocrites.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.600]   We have to be able to be indistractable ourselves.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.120]   So that's the best thing you can do.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.800]   And then talking about some of these techniques
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.000]   and asking them if not to join you on the journey
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.440]   to help just to understand
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   that you are on this journey to become indistractable.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.360]   And knowing that for yourself as well,
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.440]   we all will get distracted from time to time
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.880]   on the road to becoming indistractable.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.920]   Being indistractable doesn't mean you never get distracted.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:58.080]   It means that you're the kind of person
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.920]   who strives to do what they say they're going to do.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.440]   So you're learning from this process.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.320]   You're iterating.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.000]   You're a scientist, not a drill sergeant.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.080]   A scientist makes hypotheses.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.040]   You test them.
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.920]   And then you see what works.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.520]   And then you run the experiments again
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:11.440]   to make it better and better over time.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.280]   And so understanding this process
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.720]   is not a one and done type thing.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.560]   That it is a journey,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.960]   is a great way to help yourself become indistractable.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.200]   And it tends to be a little infectious, right?
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.720]   And especially if there's something
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.400]   where there's something in it for them too.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.520]   So let me give you an example.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:27.280]   So let's get a little personal here.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.480]   We've been talking for almost an hour.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.160]   So I'll default a little bit here.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.880]   You know, I've been married.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.800]   I just celebrated my 20th anniversary.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.000]   I'm actually the same woman.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.120]   Congratulations.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.160]   Thank you. Appreciate it.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.560]   A few years ago, our sex life was suffering
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.280]   because, you know, every night we would go to bed
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.880]   and she would caress her iPhone
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.640]   and I would fondle my computer.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.640]   And we weren't being together.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.520]   We weren't being intimate.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:48.960]   We were going to bed later and later,
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.280]   you know, maybe watching Netflix or checking email
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.160]   or doing whatever in bed.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   And we would collapse exhausted
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.400]   and we didn't have time to be intimate.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.720]   So we follow these steps in the book
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.080]   to regain our love life.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.760]   And so we went through step by step.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.960]   Okay, what are the internal triggers?
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.760]   Why are we doing this?
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.600]   We made time for traction.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.200]   We started scheduling a bedtime.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.120]   We hacked back the external triggers.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.520]   We don't sleep with any devices in our bedroom.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.880]   All that stuff is outside.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.560]   And then finally we made a pact.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.000]   And so how do we make this pact?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.600]   This is called an effort pact.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.960]   I went to the hardware store
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.920]   and I bought a $5 outlet timer.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.560]   And this outlet timer, anything you plug into it
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.120]   will turn off at a certain time of day or night
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.480]   based on what you set.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.760]   And so in our household, every night at 10 p.m,
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.880]   the internet shuts off automatically, right?
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.120]   This is called what we, this is an effort pact.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.400]   Could I turn the internet back on?
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.880]   Of course I could, but I'd have to go under my desk,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:42.560]   unplug the router, replug it in.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.840]   And this timer thingy, and only then can I get online.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.200]   So I could do it, of course, but it takes effort, right?
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.120]   So by making that, adding some friction
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.600]   to something I don't wanna do with this internet timer,
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   we all kind of know that,
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.080]   hey, the internet's gonna shut off at 10 p.m, right?
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.360]   Like quick finish what you're doing
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.320]   so that we can have traction as opposed to distraction
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.920]   doing what we said we're going to do.
[00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.320]   Getting to bed on time means we get more sleep.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.240]   And now we have a sex life again.
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.560]   - That's fantastic for you.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.360]   Congratulations.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.480]   - Thank you, thank you.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.960]   - So a debate that I often have with my wife
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.520]   is whether we as kind of humans,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.600]   and she would argue women better than men,
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.280]   can be good multitaskers,
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.160]   or is that just a massive form of distraction?
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.320]   - So yeah, so this is one of those productivity orthodoxies
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   that I want to kill the sacred cow
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.080]   that it is not true that you can't multitask.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.520]   Of course you can multitask.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.960]   We can walk and chew gum at the same time.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.400]   The question is how do we multitask?
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.120]   So what you cannot do is you can't have sensory input
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.720]   on the same channel at the same time.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.640]   You can't listen to a podcast in each ear
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.680]   and figure out what's going on.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.080]   You can't watch two television shows at the same time.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.920]   You can't do two math problems at the same time.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.440]   But you absolutely can have
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:58.000]   what I call multi-channel multitasking.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.040]   So you can definitely listen to a podcast
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.240]   while you're exercising.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.560]   So this is a technique that's called temptation bundling
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.720]   that Katie Milkman researched this technique.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.240]   What it basically involves is using a reward
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.320]   from one area of your life to help incentivize you
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.680]   to do something in another area of your life
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.120]   that maybe you don't want to do as much.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.640]   So for me, I never read articles on the web.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.200]   So when I'm on my desktop, I never read articles
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.760]   because I know that the New York Times and CNN
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.480]   and whatever media company,
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.360]   they designed their product to get me hooked, right?
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.440]   To keep me reading and reading and reading
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:32.800]   with their clickbait headlines.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.840]   I don't want to do that.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.560]   So when I see an article online I want to read,
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.960]   I save it to an app called Pocket.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.640]   And then I only consume those articles
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.840]   while I'm doing something else,
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.360]   like while I'm exercising, okay?
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.320]   Or while I'm taking a walk.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.080]   It's the only time I can consume those articles.
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.200]   How does that happen?
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.800]   It comes with a text-to-speech feature
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.040]   that will read to you those articles, right?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.320]   Just like a podcast.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.520]   So that's fantastic, right?
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.600]   So I've taken something that I don't want to do,
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.080]   which is get distracted while I'm on the internet.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.280]   And I've used it as a reward in another area of my life
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:05.120]   by using multi-channel multitasking.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.880]   So you absolutely can multi-channel multitask.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.040]   You can take a phone call or a Zoom meeting
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.400]   while you're taking a walk, for example.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.640]   You can definitely do it on different sensory channels.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.240]   And it's a great way to get more out of your day.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.920]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.280]   So we're pretty much at time,
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:18.640]   but I have to believe
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.560]   that if you spent years writing a book
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.920]   to solve this problem in your life,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.080]   you're the kind of person that thinks carefully
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.680]   about other ways to make life better,
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:26.880]   happier, healthier.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:29.360]   So I'll end asking if you have any favorite
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.520]   kind of optimizations, life hacks,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.000]   things that you do that might not be obvious to everyone
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.280]   or normal for everyone.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.000]   - That might not be normal for...
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.960]   A lot of what I do is not normal, right?
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.760]   A lot of people think,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.360]   "Oh, it's crazy to time box your day.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.080]   That's too rigid."
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.040]   A lot of people think that,
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.440]   "Oh, here's something that if you have..."
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.160]   Many of us before the pandemic
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.400]   found that colleagues were interrupting us.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.160]   Now, many of us are working at home
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.160]   and now it's our kids, it's our spouses,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:56.720]   it's our roommates
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.320]   that are the sources of distraction.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.120]   So one thing that we do in our household with my daughter
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.440]   is when she was only six years old,
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.200]   we started using what we call the concentration crown.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.520]   The concentration crown is this headpiece
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.280]   that we got on Amazon for like $5.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.040]   It has these little LED lights.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.080]   And when my wife wears a concentration crown,
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.440]   you can't miss it when she's wearing,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.480]   it literally lights up.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.200]   When she is wearing that concentration crown,
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:21.840]   we told my daughter,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.440]   "Look, when mommy's wearing the concentration crown,
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.280]   that means that she can't be interrupted
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   and she will be with you within a half an hour, right?
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.720]   All her time boxes are half an hour or less."
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.200]   And so this works like a charm
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   because look, your kids, give them a break.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.960]   They don't know if you're on your computer,
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.680]   if you're doing something
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:39.600]   that requires focus and concentration
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.760]   or whether you're watching YouTube videos or something
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.040]   and you can be interrupted.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.560]   So by putting on the concentration crown,
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.800]   what you're doing is interrupting the interruption.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.960]   It works incredibly well with kids.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.880]   It also works really well with spouses.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.480]   So when I want to interrupt my wife,
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.080]   but I see she's wearing the concentration crown,
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.280]   I also leave her alone.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.800]   And I also have a concentration crown.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:58.000]   It's not as pretty as hers.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.360]   I just wear a silly hat.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.080]   Anybody can do this.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.560]   Just look for a crazy looking hat around your house.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.920]   Tell your kids what it's for
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.840]   or your spouse or your roommate what it's for
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.800]   and it works like a charm.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.240]   - That's fantastic.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.480]   And the last thing I didn't see in the book,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.640]   you have a whole chapter about raising kids
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.000]   to be indistractable.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.080]   How early do you think that actually starts?
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.120]   And I ask as the father of a 14 month old.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:22.560]   - Yeah, I would say when they're that young, of course,
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:24.560]   all the screen time is up to you.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:25.920]   I would say it's about the same rule
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.400]   as when a kid is ready to go swimming, right?
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.560]   Pools are incredibly dangerous, right?
[00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.000]   Thousands of children die every year
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.960]   because they drown in a pool.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.640]   But as a responsible parent,
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.480]   you're not gonna say pools are deadly.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.840]   I'm not gonna let my kid ever learn to swim.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.680]   No, you're gonna teach them how to swim.
[00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.160]   And so it's the same rule with, I think, digital technology
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   and specifically how to control their attention.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.000]   So I would say around five or six,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.680]   this is a conversation you can have with your kid
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.240]   on how to help them learn to become indistractable.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.640]   And look, if you think the world is distracting now,
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.360]   just wait a few years, right?
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:56.720]   The world that our kids inhabit
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.560]   is only going to become more distracting.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.920]   So it's absolutely essential
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:01.440]   that they learn how to control their attention
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.680]   because it truly will be how they choose their life.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.800]   - Awesome.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.320]   So I got a few years to practice.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.880]   Before we go, where should people find you online?
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.000]   What are you working on right now
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.040]   that people should check out?
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.560]   - Yeah, so my website is nearandfar.com.
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.600]   Near is spelled like my first name.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.160]   So that's N-I-R-andfar.com.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:21.360]   There's actually a free 80 page indistractable workbook.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.880]   We couldn't fit it into the final edition of the book.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.920]   So it's yours for free.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.880]   It's complimentary.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.320]   And you can download that at Near and Far.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:27.920]   And the book is called "Indistractable,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:29.840]   "How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life."
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.600]   And that's available wherever books are sold.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.760]   - Yeah, links to everything in the show notes.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.360]   Near, thank you so much for being here.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.800]   - Oh, my pleasure, Chris.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.360]   Thanks so much.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:43.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.160]   - Wow.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.240]   I hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.160]   I already know it's gonna be one of the episodes
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.160]   I need to go back to and listen myself
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.440]   so I can take notes.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.480]   And that's coming from someone
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.320]   who just read Near's book also.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:57.360]   Okay, so to all the listeners out there
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.720]   who've been writing in with questions

[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.480]   I'm also considering setting up a Facebook group,

[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.000]   for listeners to be able to ask me
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.520]   maybe other listeners questions
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.360]   and get more real-time feedback.

[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.560]   Good luck becoming indistractable
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.360]   and see you next week.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:13.920]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.240]   that goes deep on all things money.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.920]   That means everything from money hacks
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.080]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.320]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.200]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.360]   and spending your money on the things you value
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.320]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.240]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.480]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.120]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.600]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   I know because I was a guest on the show
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.440]   in December, 2022,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   but recently I listened to an episode
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.680]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.040]   that will blow your mind
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.880]   and it was so crazy to learn things
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.840]   like 35% of millennials are not participating
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.760]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.440]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.720]   The Personal Finance Podcast
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.080]   has something for everyone.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.720]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   to help you get better with your money
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.600]   and grow your wealth.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.680]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.000]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
