[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.920]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E dot com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.120]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.000]   your life, money, and travel, all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.080]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you on my journey.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.840]   Today's conversation is all about distraction, something that impacts all of
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560]   us, and I know because it definitely takes a toll on me almost every day.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   So I'm talking with Nir Eyal about becoming what he calls indistractable.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.800]   Almost sounds like a superpower, right?
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.320]   Now, Nir has quite the impressive background.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.640]   He's previously taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and their
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.560]   design school.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.880]   He's co-founded and sold two tech companies.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   He's an active angel investor, but perhaps most relevant to today, he's the
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.440]   author of two best-selling books, first, Hooked, How to Build Habit-Forming
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   Products, and second, Indistractable, How to Control Your Attention and Choose
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   Your Life, which has received critical acclaim, winning the Outstanding Works of
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Literature Award, as well as being named one of the best business and leadership
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.120]   books of the year by Amazon.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.600]   In our conversation, we discuss the hidden psychology that drives us to
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.080]   distraction and what so many people get wrong about overcoming it.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.080]   Nir also shares his four-step research-backed model for becoming
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.320]   indistractable and how to use it to take back control of your time and start
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   making traction on the things that matter to you in your life.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.840]   This episode is so chocked full of actionable advice.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.920]   Nir, thanks for being here.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.280]   Great to be here, Chris.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.720]   Thanks.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.680]   Yeah, so I went into reading your latest book and I was thinking that if I could
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400]   become indistractable, I could just avoid my notifications.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   And I quickly realized it is a whole lot more than that.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.920]   And so I thought a good way to just kick off is how do you
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.640]   actually define distraction?
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.200]   Absolutely.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.960]   So this is a great question because it's a term that I think I, I thought I
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   understood, but really didn't once I started diving into this research around
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.040]   the psychology of why we get distracted.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.400]   So the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.560]   what distraction is not.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.680]   So what is the opposite of distraction?
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   Most people will say, well, it's obviously right.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.280]   It's focus.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.320]   Well, not true.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.400]   The opposite of distraction is not focus.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.720]   If you look at the origin of the word, the opposite of distraction is traction.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.440]   That, uh, by definition, traction is any action that pulls you towards
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.680]   what you say you're going to do.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.720]   Things that move you closer to your goals, closer to your values, help you
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.080]   become the kind of person you want to become.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.960]   The opposite of traction, distraction.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.800]   Distraction is any action that pulls you further away from your goals, further
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.840]   away from what you said you were going to do, further away from your values
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.680]   and further away from becoming the kind of person you want to become.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.640]   So this isn't just semantics.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.160]   This is super important because I would argue any action, by the way, you
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.360]   notice that both traction and distraction end in the same six letters,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.160]   A-C-T-I-O-N, that spells action.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.600]   So I would argue that any action that you do with intent, anything that it
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   uses for thought is traction, right?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.760]   It's what you plan to do.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.080]   Anything that is not that is distraction.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.920]   So let me give you an example.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   So driving home, you know, for years I would go to my desk and I'd say, okay,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.080]   I'm going to get to work right now.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.840]   Uh, I got my cup of coffee.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.760]   I got everything set.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.400]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to focus.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   I'm going to do what I said I'm going to do.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.040]   I got my list of to-do's.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.960]   By the way, we can talk about why to-do's are one of the worst things
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.880]   you can do for your productivity.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.560]   We can get to that later.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.960]   Now I'm going to get started.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.520]   Here I go right now.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   Nothing's going to get in my way.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.600]   I'm not going to procrastinate.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.360]   But first let me check email real quick, right?
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   That's a work related task.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.600]   I'm being productive.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   I'm doing email.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.760]   I got to do that at some point, or, or let me do that thing on my to-do list.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.160]   It's maybe not the top of my to-do list.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.760]   The most important thing, let me just get some stuff done just to get some momentum
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.200]   going, right?
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   I'm still being productive.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.960]   And what I didn't realize is that that is the most dangerous, pernicious form of
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.560]   distraction.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.720]   The distraction that tricks you into prioritizing the urgent and easy work at
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.200]   the expense of the hard and important work that we have to do to move our lives
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.360]   and our businesses forward.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.080]   So just because something is a work related task doesn't mean it's not a
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.600]   distraction.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.320]   That is the worst kind of distraction because you don't even realize it's
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   happening to you.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.680]   If it's not what you said you were going to do, it's a distraction.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.240]   Conversely, everything can be traction as long as you plan for it.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.560]   So don't believe these chicken little tech critics that tell you, "Oh,
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.640]   technology is hijacking your brain and social media is bad for you."
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   And it's all rubbish.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.760]   It's ridiculous.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.440]   There's nothing wrong with going on Facebook or YouTube or Reddit or whatever
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.360]   you want to do with your time.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.200]   Video games, great, do it.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.600]   But do it on your schedule, not someone else's, not on the tech company's
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.920]   schedule.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.840]   Do it according to your values and your schedule.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.880]   Then it becomes traction because as Dorothy Parker said, "The time you plan
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.840]   to waste is not wasted time."
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.280]   So as long as it's what you do with intent, with forethought, planned ahead,
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.680]   you can enjoy it, guilt free, as opposed to everything else that's not what you
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.480]   said you were going to do, that is a distraction.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.200]   So I want to dig into the root cause of this distraction.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.360]   But before, most people who write nonfiction books, their second book is
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.080]   kind of the sequel of their first book.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.800]   And I'd love to understand how your journey came from writing a book about
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.160]   building habits for products to helping people avoid the distractions that maybe
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.680]   and sometimes are those products that maybe built habits through some of the
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.840]   tactics in your first book.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.120]   In fact, when I pitched the book to my agent, she said, "Oh, okay, so now
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.960]   you're going to write unhooked."
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.000]   I said, "No, no, no, no, no, that's not the idea at all."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.960]   Because I still stand behind everything I wrote in Hook, that we can build
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.440]   products that create healthy habits in users' lives.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.360]   And that's exactly what's happened since I've written Hook.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.240]   You know, companies in every conceivable industry, FitBot uses the Hook model to
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.720]   get people hooked on exercise.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.760]   Kahoot uses the Hook model to get kids hooked on to education.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.600]   We can use the Hook model, we can use the same techniques that the social media
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.080]   companies and the gaming companies use.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.800]   We can use those techniques to build healthy habits in our users' lives, no
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   matter the industry, right?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   If it's enterprise software, banking, healthcare, there's all kinds of
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   industries that apply the Hook model for good.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   So if Hooked is about building good habits, Indistractable is about how do
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.560]   we break bad habits, but we can have our cake and eat it too, right?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   We want a language app to teach us the language, but we also don't want to
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.920]   overuse and distract ourselves with social media, and we want to use it
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.560]   responsibly.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.520]   So that's really where I'm coming from.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.640]   Hooked is about building good habits, Indistractable is about breaking bad
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.880]   habits.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.320]   They don't necessarily negate each other.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.680]   And was there a moment in time where you thought, "Okay, I have to write this
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.040]   book"?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.680]   Yeah, so for me, it was shortly after I wrote Hooked, and I was getting some
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.240]   notoriety.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.760]   I was getting a bunch of five-star reviews on Amazon, and I was doing
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.960]   speaking gigs and consulting engagements, and I had this afternoon planned with my
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.360]   daughter.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.800]   Just some quality daddy-daughter time.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.760]   And I remember I had this book of activities that we could play together,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   you know, like do a Sudoku puzzle or a paper airplane contest, you know, things
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:21.920]   like that.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   And one of the questions in the book that we were supposed to ask each other was,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.560]   "If you could have any superpower, what superpower would you want?"
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.600]   And I remember that question verbatim, but I can't tell you what my daughter
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.120]   said, because in that instance, for whatever reason, I started checking my
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.480]   phone, and when I looked up for my device, I realized that she was gone.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.720]   She got the message I was sending, which was that my phone was more important
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.240]   than she was, and she left the room to play with some toy outside.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.720]   And that's when I knew I had to figure this out, because look, I know these
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.360]   techniques and tricks from the inside, right?
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.080]   I wrote the book Hooked.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.320]   I know exactly how they get you hooked.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.240]   And here I was getting distracted from one of the most important people in my
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.560]   life.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.160]   And so that was the turning point.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.800]   I said, "I got to figure this out for myself."
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   And of course, it wasn't just with her.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.800]   It was when I would tell myself, "Oh, I'm definitely going to exercise today."
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.200]   Right?
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.440]   How many times have we told ourself that?
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.240]   And then we skip.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.360]   Or, "Oh, I'm certainly going to eat right."
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:18.680]   Right?
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.080]   "Today's the day I'm going to eat healthfully."
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.800]   And I wouldn't.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.480]   Or, "I'm definitely going to go to bed on time."
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   Or, "I'm definitely going to work on that big project today."
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.520]   And somehow we don't do what we say we're going to do.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.200]   So what I originally did, and I think a lot of people do, is I blamed the
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.760]   technology.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.000]   I thought, "Okay, maybe the technology is the problem."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.360]   Right?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.840]   Like that we just can't stop.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.280]   And so I took the, because that's what all the other books tell you to do.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:38.560]   Right?
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.160]   Like the, the digital detoxing and all that.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   And I kind of bought into that.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.360]   That was my knee-jerk reaction of, "Oh, the technology, it's evil.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.880]   They have a profit motive to capture your attention.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.960]   So I'll just stop using the technology."
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.040]   And I got myself a flip phone from Alibaba.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.560]   This 1990s looking phone that doesn't have, didn't have any apps, no internet
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.600]   connection, certainly no social media.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:04.000]   I got myself a word processor off of eBay so that I could write with no internet
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.480]   connection.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.000]   And I said, "Okay, great.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.960]   Now I'm off the technology, right?
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.040]   No internet connection.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.640]   I'm going to get started on my work.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.800]   Nothing's going to distract me.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.400]   Except, uh, you see there's that book on the bookcase that I've been meaning to
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:16.600]   read.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.240]   Let me, let me just, let me just check that out real quick.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.600]   There's one chapter I wanted to read real quick.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.040]   Or, "Oh man, my desk is such a mess right now.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   Let me just clean up my desk or the trash needs to be taken."
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   And I kept getting distracted because here's the thing.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.080]   My revelation was it's not the technology, right?
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.200]   That you don't need the tech tools.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.240]   That's just the proximal cause.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.680]   It's not the root cause of the problem.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.840]   That in fact, when I started researching this topic, I found that Plato, the Greek
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.680]   philosopher, was struggling with distraction 2,500 years before the internet.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   People have always complained about distraction.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.880]   It was the television and the radio and the comic book and literally every
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.560]   technology.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.320]   People freak out.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.520]   They have a moral panic around and they blame the proximal cause as opposed to
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.600]   getting to the root cause.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   And so I, it didn't work for me to just get rid of the technology.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   Not only that, it's really easy for some professor in an ivory tower to say, stop
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.280]   using social media, but my livelihood depends on it.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.760]   And like, I can't do that.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   It's really easy to say, stop checking email.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.880]   Well, thanks, stupid.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   I'm going to get fired.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.080]   So that, that wasn't a good solution.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.440]   So I really wanted to figure out how we can enjoy these technologies, get the best
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.480]   out of them without letting them get the best of us.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.200]   I mean, I, we've all heard that technology is the problem, but what is the root
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.720]   cause?
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.000]   So the root cause is, uh, it's, it's a great question because you think about it.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   Like, wait a minute, if we know what to do, why don't we just do it?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.600]   Especially in this day and age, right?
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.560]   Who doesn't know how to lose weight?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.800]   Come on, find me a person who doesn't know that chocolate cake is not as healthy
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.920]   as a healthful salad.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.760]   We know you eat right.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.400]   You exercise.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.760]   Who doesn't know that to have better relationships, you have to spend quality
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.440]   time with the people you love without distraction.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:54.960]   We know this.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.360]   Who doesn't know that if you want to be better at your job, you have to do the
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.440]   freaking work, right?
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   Especially the hard stuff that other people don't want to do.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.320]   We know.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.000]   And if you don't know, Google it, what's your excuse?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.440]   It's all there.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.280]   So the problem is not that we don't know.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.040]   We know.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.640]   The problem is we don't know how to stop getting in our own way.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.240]   We don't know how to stop getting distracted.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.080]   And so to answer that question of why don't we do, we say we're going to do
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.920]   despite knowing what to do, we have to ask an even deeper question, which is why
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.640]   do we do everything?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.880]   What's the nature of human motivation?
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.880]   And this is something that I think most people, I certainly didn't understand
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.000]   fully that most of us have a messed up conception of what motivation is all
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.280]   about.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   If you ask the average person, how do you get others or yourself to do something?
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.560]   What's the nature of human motivation?
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.720]   They're going to tell you what Sigmund Freud said, what Jeremy Bentham said,
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.360]   which is the pleasure principle that everything we do is about the pursuit of
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.320]   pleasure and the avoidance of pain, right?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.040]   Maybe they won't use that terminology.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.280]   They'll tell you carrots and sticks.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.040]   Basically, that's, that's what we've all been told.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.560]   Neurologically speaking, this is not true.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.280]   That motivation is not about carrots and sticks.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   It's not about the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but actually
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.560]   it's just one of those things that everything you do, everything you do is
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.280]   about the desire to escape discomfort.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.320]   That's it.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.600]   The desire to escape discomfort, all human motivation.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.720]   It's called the homeostatic response that if you think about this
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.240]   physiologically, that if you go outside and you're cold, then the brain says,
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.160]   Ooh, this doesn't feel good.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.880]   This is uncomfortable.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.600]   You should put on a coat.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.640]   If you walk back in, now you get too hot.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.840]   The brain says, that doesn't feel good.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.400]   Take it off.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.440]   If you're hungry, you feel hunger pangs.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.880]   So you eat, and if you eat too much, oh, you feel stuffed.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.680]   The brain says, stop.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.520]   That doesn't feel good either.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.840]   So physiologically, this is common sense.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.160]   The same holds true psychologically that if you feel lonely, check Facebook.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.680]   If you are uncertain, Google it before you scan your brain to see if you know
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.440]   the answer, you're automatically Googling it.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   If you're feeling bored, lots of solutions for boredom, right?
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.080]   You can check stock prices, sports scores.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:58.240]   Oh, let's worry about somebody's problems 3000 miles away by tuning
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.080]   into the news so that we don't have to think about what's going on in our own head.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.280]   And do you think people know that they have this pain all the time, or
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.120]   is sometimes this discomfort unknown?
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.320]   No, no, no.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.120]   We almost never realize that that's what's driving our behavior, even though it is.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.440]   That that desire to escape discomfort is what gets us to do everything we do.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.880]   Even people are probably saying, well, yeah, but what about the pursuit of pleasure?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.760]   What about feeling good?
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:26.840]   Well, even the desire to feel good, what drives us to get that pleasure is desire,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.160]   craving, lusting, which is itself psychologically destabilizing.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.720]   So even the pursuit of pleasurable sensations, the brain spurs us to action
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.880]   by making us feel bad enough to go get that thing we want to acquire or feel.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.760]   Right?
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   So all human behavior stems from a desire to escape discomfort.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.360]   And once you understand that, what that therefore must mean is
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.200]   that time management is pain management.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.760]   Let me say it again.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.520]   Time management is pain management.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   So none of the tips and tricks and techniques.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.600]   Look, I spent five years researching and writing this book, and I've looked
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.320]   at all the literature virtually, right?
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.680]   I've read all the books on time management.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.560]   I will tell you, none of the techniques work, none of the tips and tricks
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.280]   and gurus and life hacks, none of that stuff works if you don't first
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.200]   understand what is the discomfort driving you to distraction, that
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.160]   distraction, procrastination, it's not a character flaw, there's
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.240]   nothing wrong with you, right?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.480]   People love to moralize and medicalize this topic.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.160]   The vast majority of people, there's nothing wrong with you.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.480]   It's simply that we haven't learned how to deal with discomfort.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.880]   And so once you learn that, once you do what I call master the internal
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.240]   triggers, they no longer become your master.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.000]   So that's the first step to becoming indistractable is
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.360]   mastering the internal triggers.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.880]   The second step is about making time for traction.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.760]   We talked about that earlier.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.640]   Traction is any action that pulls you towards what you said you're going to do.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.360]   So, you know, there's some very simple things that all of us can do to make
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.800]   sure we make time for traction in our day.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   The third step is to hack back what we call the external triggers.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.760]   The external triggers, this is what people tend to blame.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.560]   It's the pings, the dings, the rings, anything in your outside
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.360]   environment, like you said, that, that can move you towards distraction.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.840]   Studies find, however, that that's only 10% of the time that we get distracted.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.800]   Is it because of something in our external environment?
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.280]   So the other 90% of the time, 90% is not about what's happening outside of us.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.800]   It's about what's happening inside of us.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.920]   But there are still things we can do to hack back those external triggers.
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.600]   So that's step three, step four.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.400]   And the final step is to prevent distraction with pacts.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.520]   And so it's when we use these four steps in concert, this is how
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.160]   anyone can become indistractable.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.640]   So I'd love to dig in on the four steps.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.680]   When I read the book this week and it was fantastic, by the way, to anyone
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.760]   listening, definitely pick up a copy, but I had a few questions
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.000]   that I'd love to talk about.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.080]   So I'll start with step one, mastering the internal triggers.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.840]   When you feel an urge to be distracted, you talk about pausing
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.440]   to explore that distraction.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.120]   But what's the end goal of better understanding that feeling when
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.160]   you're about to get distracted?
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.400]   It's about having arrows in your quiver ready so that when you feel
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.480]   that discomfort, it's not, you know, oh, meditate about it, right?
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.680]   Sometimes you need to get off your butt and stop meditating and take action.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.000]   And so what I advise people is to have tools ready at their disposal
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.080]   so that when they feel that discomfort, they know in advance
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.520]   what they are going to do with it.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.000]   You know, there's this myth around visualization.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.360]   We've all heard that if you want to achieve your dreams, you have
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.400]   to visualize your, your goals, right?
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   If you want to get in shape, you want to visualize yourself with a beach body.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.520]   If you want to be wealthy, you have to visualize yourself in a Lamborghini or
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.000]   some other materialistic crap, right?
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.320]   Turns out that stuff doesn't work.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.320]   That visualization of end goals actually backfires.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.200]   It makes it less likely for you to achieve your goal because you're
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.400]   giving yourself the pleasure of having it without actually doing
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.960]   anything for it in your mind.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   So that kind of visualization doesn't work.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.680]   What does work is, and this has been shown in studies, that visualizing what
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.840]   you will do when you are tempted, when you are tempted to go off track.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.920]   So if you have an aspiration to lose weight, for example, don't visualize
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.240]   the beach body, visualize what you will do when someone offers you chocolate
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.080]   cake at a dinner party and you want to refuse, what are you going to say?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.840]   What preparation will you take now so that you know what to do tomorrow?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.200]   So one of the most important lessons of the book is this mantra that I repeat
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:22.400]   to myself every day, which is that the antidote to impulsiveness is forethought.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.320]   Let me say that again.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.240]   The antidote to impulsiveness is forethought.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.760]   So distraction, procrastination is all about impulsiveness, right?
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.480]   It's that we know what to do long-term, but in the moment, we don't do it.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.160]   Right?
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.960]   We do something else.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.440]   So the antidote is forethought so that if you can plan today for what you will
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.840]   do tomorrow, there is no distraction that you can't overcome because if you wait
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.400]   to the last minute, right, if you wait till the chocolate cake is on its way to
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.880]   your mouth, you're going to eat it.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.040]   If you wait till the cigarette is in your hand, you're going to smoke it.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.080]   If you sleep next to your cell phone every night, of course, you're going to
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.240]   pick it up first thing in the morning before you even say hello to your loved
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.400]   ones because it's too late, you've lost, they're going to get you.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.840]   You have to plan ahead.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.560]   So when it comes to these internal triggers, the strategy is to know what
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   you will do when you feel boredom, loneliness, uncertainty, stress, anxiety,
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.120]   fatigue, what are you going to do?
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.800]   Are you going to do what most people do, which is trying to escape that
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.560]   discomfort with too much news, too much booze, too much football, too much
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.280]   Facebook, there's a hundred different ways to distract your attention away
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.880]   from what you said you were going to do, or are you going to use that
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.760]   discomfort as rocket fuel to propel you towards traction as opposed to
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.160]   succumbing to distraction.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.880]   And there's all kinds of different tools.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.560]   There's all kinds of different arrows in your quiver that you can use so that
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.520]   when you feel that discomfort, you will know what to do with it.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.640]   So it's funny, my wife and I have a challenge, which is she has a lot of
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.560]   self-control over kind of urges, especially around health things, right?
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.720]   If she bakes, you know, two dozen cookies, she has no problem just
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.680]   leaving them on the counter.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.960]   Ugh, I can't stand those people.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.040]   I know, I know.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.720]   My solution is I'm really good at the grocery store saying, let's just not
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.280]   buy cookies, like, let's not buy the ingredients for you to bake.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   And she's like, well, baking's therapy, so I want to bake.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.160]   And I'm like, well, could you just bake one cookie?
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.280]   She's like, well, if I'm going to go through all this effort, I might as
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.320]   well bake two dozen cookies.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.560]   And so one of the things I tried this week was, you know, you mentioned the
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.400]   surfing the urge, which I just wanted to share, like for people out there in my
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.720]   situation, I said, you know what, anytime I see this cookie on the counter, now
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.720]   that it's baked, I lose all self control.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.480]   But so I told myself, okay, every time I want a cookie, I can have one if I just
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   wait 10 minutes.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.880]   And you know, you said earlier, it's hard to wait till the last minute.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.120]   But even in the last minute, I found a few tactics that were very effective,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.680]   obviously way more effective for me to just not have the cookies in the house.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.600]   But that tactic of waiting for 10 minutes made me realize, oh, I have
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.080]   control over not eating this cookie.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.600]   Now after 10 minutes, I don't want it.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.400]   And that was fantastic.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:46.720]   Right?
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   So so yeah, so not having the cookie in the house would be an example of hacking
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.320]   back the external trigger, which is great.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.200]   But the world is full of external triggers, right?
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.160]   So you can't swear off technology, the trigger will be there.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.720]   Now there's some things you can do to remove some external triggers, right?
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.080]   You can remove certain apps from your phone, you can turn off notifications,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.520]   things like that.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.000]   Okay, fine.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.040]   But there will always be certain temptations.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.800]   So what do you do in the moment?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.760]   What you did is actually you use forethought, you said, next time that I
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.280]   have this urge, I'm going to use the 10 minute rule.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   And so the 10 minute rule is one of dozens of different techniques we can
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.760]   use.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.720]   And so the 10 minute rule basically says that I can give into that
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.040]   distraction, whether it's eating the cookie or smoking a cigarette or
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.840]   scrolling the internet, whatever the case might be, but not right now, in 10
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.920]   minutes, right?
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.160]   So what you're doing is you're building self efficacy, you're showing yourself
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.880]   Wait a minute, I can wait a few minutes, just 10 minutes, you're not telling
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.080]   yourself No, because in fact, we know that abstinence can oftentimes backfire,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.360]   that telling yourself don't do something only makes you want it more with with
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.440]   many behaviors, instead of saying no, you're telling yourself not yet.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.960]   And so then the 10 minute rule becomes the 11 minute rule, the 12 minute rule,
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:52.680]   the 15 minute rule.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.720]   And so you're able to build that self efficacy to not get distracted later on.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.760]   But there is no magic bullet people always want, tell me the one thing I need
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.160]   to do.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.560]   And it's and when you look at the research literature, it's not just about
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:04.920]   one thing.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.840]   It's these four things in concert, right?
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.200]   It's knowing, okay, what am I going to do that internal trigger?
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.840]   How do I make time for traction?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.680]   When is it okay for me to eat that cookie, right?
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.240]   Maybe there's a time when it and a place where it is okay, and you have that
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.960]   planned ahead.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.240]   Removing the external triggers, hacking back the external triggers, and then
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.440]   preventing distraction with packs.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.000]   What many people do is that they exert some kind of contract with themselves or
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.320]   with somebody else to make sure they don't go off track.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.400]   So these four techniques in concert is really what's essential.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.040]   Yeah, you started with saying earlier that to do lists are kind of the worst.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.680]   And I'm curious, you know, making time for traction and being kind of
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.040]   intentional is great.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.640]   To do lists, my understanding for from the book, you know, it's just a list of
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.480]   things, but there's no kind of firm commitment.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.360]   Is it the to do list that you hate?
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.600]   Or is it the fact that most to do lists don't actually have timing when and where
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   and how in it.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.120]   And if a to do list did have all those things, and, and you kind of archived
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.200]   everything that didn't have that filled out, would you like to do this again?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   Yeah, so there's nothing wrong with writing things down, right?
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.280]   Getting things out of your head and putting them on a piece of paper or, or
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:06.600]   an app.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.560]   That's a great idea.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.400]   What most people do, however, is that they run their life on a to do list, they
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   wake up in the morning, and they say, What am I supposed to do today?
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.600]   Oh, let me look at my to do list.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.280]   And they start ticking off little cute boxes.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.760]   That's terrible.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.600]   Because if you wake up in the morning, you look at your to do list, before you
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.320]   look at your calendar, you have already lost, you made a big mistake.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.960]   Principally, the big problem with to do list is that there's no constraints, you
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.080]   can always add more to a to do list, right?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.800]   It's never ending.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.360]   Whereas with a calendar with a timebox calendar, which is what I'm a big
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.920]   proponent of and what the studies find are turned out to tell people be much
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.360]   more productive and effective in their days and do what they say they're going
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:40.720]   to do.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.520]   There is a constraint, the same 24 hours that we all have in a day.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.440]   So it's not a coincidence when you think about how we use the same language with
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.320]   time as we do with money, right?
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.240]   You pay attention, you make money just like you make time.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.960]   So there's lots of terminology that's the same.
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.160]   And yet we're so cheap with our money, right?
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.960]   We scrimp and save and people won't pay 99 cents for an app.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.880]   And we split our checks with our friends when we go out to lunch, like we're so
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.680]   cheap with money.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.880]   But we give our time to whoever wants it.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.800]   And it should be exactly the opposite, right?
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.680]   That we, you can always make more money.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.320]   So you should be generous with your money.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.280]   You should be stingy with your time because you can't make more time.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.920]   We all get the same 24 hours in the day.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.240]   So by having a constraint on your time by deciding in advance, okay, I only have
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.560]   this much time in my day.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.200]   How am I going to spend it according to my values?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.560]   How can I turn my values into time?
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.800]   Now we impose those constraints.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.880]   We force that decision.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.920]   And so that helps us decide for the first time in many people's life, what is
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.440]   traction?
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.520]   You know, I meet with so many people who tell me how distracted they are.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.080]   And I say, well, well, what did you get distracted from?
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   Show me your schedule.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760]   And there's a bunch of white space.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.840]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.760]   How can you say you got distracted from something if you didn't know what you got
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.200]   distracted from?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.120]   Right?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.160]   If you can't see in your calendar, what is traction, you can't define distraction.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.560]   So that's why it's one of the reasons that that timebox calendar is so much more
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.960]   effective than to do list.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.760]   Another big reason, this is probably the even the more important reason is that to
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.200]   do list reinforce a negative self identity.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.920]   Meaning, you know, this happened to me all the time.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.960]   I call this the tyranny of the to do list, I would come home from work, and it'd be a
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.320]   hard day, I'd feel exhausted.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.920]   And so man, I'm so busy today.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.160]   And then I look at my to do list and see, you know, what I still didn't finish.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.640]   And there were still 100 things on that to do list that I didn't do.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.000]   And so day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, I was
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.520]   reinforcing that I wasn't doing what I said I was going to do, loser.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:43.400]   And so over time, you begin to believe this, this stupid narrative that, oh, I
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.240]   must not be very good with time management.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.160]   Right?
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.280]   Maybe I have an attention problem, maybe there's something wrong with me that I
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.400]   can't finish this stuff.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.920]   And for the vast majority of people, there's nothing wrong with them.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.040]   It's just that they haven't learned the proper techniques to make sure that they
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.600]   follow through on what they say they're going to do.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.920]   So that's why calendars beat to do lists by far.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.280]   And it's funny, you know, whenever I used to tell this story, somebody would say,
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.240]   well, what about Mark Andreessen?
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   Mark Andreessen wrote a famous story.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:10.600]   You know, Mark, well, you know, he wrote a famous blog post about how he, he
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.800]   leaves his days open, right?
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.000]   He wants to be spontaneous.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.440]   And then I just saw a couple months ago that he changed his mind.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:21.240]   Then now he shared an interview, his time box calendar.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.280]   And I, yes, I was so happy to see that.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.480]   You won him over.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   Yeah, well, I don't know if I did, but he, he changed his ways, which is fantastic.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.240]   And does that mean that if I, you know, if you shared your calendar, it would be
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   fully scheduled, you know, including sleeping 24/7 the whole week?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.880]   Yep, absolutely.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.920]   No space for distraction, you know, or I guess you can have intentional
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.280]   distraction, but you can have diversion.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.160]   So there's, so distraction is never good.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.480]   Okay.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.080]   Distraction is always when you don't do what you said you're going to do.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.040]   Now you can get diverted.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   A diversion is very different from a distraction.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.680]   A diversion is a refocusing of attention.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   So last night I went to go see Dune, right?
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.240]   I went to go see a movie with, with my friend and with my daughter.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.000]   And that was a diversion of attention.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.280]   I paid to go to a movie theater and have my attention diverted from
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.960]   real life into this fictional world.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.560]   It's fun.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.080]   It's great.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.000]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.040]   But guess what?
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.200]   That time was in my calendar.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.320]   I knew that that's what I was going to do.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.880]   So you can have time for prayer, for meditation, for spontaneity, right?
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.040]   It sounds like an oxymoron.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.240]   I have planned spontaneity in my calendar.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.000]   So every Saturday afternoon, I spend time with my daughter.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.240]   We call it that time planned spontaneity.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.880]   Why?
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.040]   Because I don't know what we're going to do.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.120]   We might go to the park.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.080]   We might go get ice cream.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.000]   We might go take a walk.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.800]   We don't know what we're going to do.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.600]   But I know what I will not do at that time.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.120]   And that's why I booked that time in advance.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.320]   I will not be checking my phone.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.720]   I will not be taking work calls.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.120]   I will not be on social media because I have planned ahead that my daughter is
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.920]   the person who I will devote that time to.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.520]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.080]   And do you ever just change plans?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.720]   Is that, is that okay in this kind of world of I was supposed to do this thing
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.080]   and I just had a really long day and I don't want to do it anymore, but I'm
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   choosing not to do it?
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.840]   Not in the moment.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.520]   Okay.
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.120]   So if you give it in the moment, then that's an impulsivity problem.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.400]   But you can reset the day for the day ahead.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.240]   Okay.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.840]   Once you set that schedule, stick with it, right?
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.960]   Even if you go off track, you don't have to think about what should I do next?
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.320]   You just go to the next thing on your calendar.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.760]   You follow the plan once you make that plan, right?
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.560]   So as much as possible, you don't divert from it.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.600]   Now, do we make mistakes?
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.120]   Of course.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.640]   I still get distracted from time to time.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.480]   The difference is that an indistractable person knows why they made that mistake,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.520]   why they got distracted and they do something about it.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.280]   So Paolo Coelho has a wonderful quote.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.960]   He said, a mistake repeated more than once is a decision.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.840]   How many times do we get distracted by the same fricking things before we say,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.600]   wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.080]   Okay.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   How many times can we blame social media?
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.120]   How many times can we blame email?
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.600]   How many times can we blame the news?
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.200]   How many times can we blame Netflix before we say, stop?
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.880]   Okay.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.360]   You're, I get what you're doing to me.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.800]   Of course they want your attention.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.560]   Are you going to just let them keep taking your attention or your time?
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.920]   Are you going to do something about it?
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.400]   So a distractible person through their actions is deciding to be distractible
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.240]   because they keep getting distracted by the same thing again and again and again.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.120]   Unless, you know, little asterisks, if there's some kind of medical disorder,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.440]   which about one to 3% of the population has ADHD.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.040]   Okay, fine.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.720]   There's an exception there.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.120]   Perhaps for the vast majority of us, 97, 99% of the population, we are
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.360]   deciding to be distractible.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.040]   Whereas an indistractable person says, okay, I see what you did there.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.440]   Now I'm going to do something about it.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.840]   I'm going to figure out what internal trigger prompted me to get distracted.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   I'm going to make time for traction.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.080]   I'm going to hack back the external triggers and I'm going to prevent
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   distraction with packs so that it doesn't happen again.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:35.200]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:35.920]   I get it.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.200]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.560]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.440]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.960]   app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.040]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.040]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.800]   just want to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.040]   to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.360]   houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.840]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.520]   massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.520]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.480]   family last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.560]   than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.480]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.840]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.880]   Yeah, and that next section that we didn't really talk much, while it
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.600]   falls so in line with the show, right?
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   Where all the hacks like that is what people, you know, come here to hear.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.120]   There's eight chapters that talked all about different triggers, external
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.560]   triggers, like email and group chat.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.600]   I don't want to just run through the list because there's literally a book where
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.320]   you could buy it and run through that list.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   My favorite was something I tried doing today, which was I started sending all
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.200]   my emails up until like four or five o'clock.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.120]   I just scheduled to send it five o'clock so that I wasn't getting all
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.240]   the replies during the day.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.200]   I wasn't distracted.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   It was kind of planning ahead.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.680]   I didn't know if there was one in that list that you want to flag as
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.160]   something, you know, you thought was kind of unique or something most
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.840]   people don't know about and you'd share.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.080]   Sure.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.920]   So that's the most kind of nuts and bolts chapter of the book where we
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.720]   actually go through all the potential external triggers that people encounter.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.320]   So we talk about how simple stuff like your phone, you know, two thirds of
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   people with a smartphone never change their notification settings.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.920]   That's come on, that's kindergarten stuff.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.400]   Of course, change your notification settings.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.760]   Can we, can we really complain that phones are addicting us and hijacking
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.520]   our brains if we haven't changed the stupid notification settings?
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.840]   That's, that's easy stuff.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.320]   But the stuff that people don't think about, it's the stuff like meetings.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.240]   How many meetings do we go to that are a complete distraction from what we really
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.960]   need to be doing with our time and our attention, uh, group chat, right?
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:04.680]   People struggle with Slack or other group messaging services.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.520]   Email.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.360]   Oh my God.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:06.720]   Email.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.560]   The email was, was when we did surveys, the number one distraction that the
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.360]   average knowledge worker faced, by the way, number one before COVID was other
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:15.760]   people.
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.040]   That was the number one distraction in the workplace.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.720]   That was number one.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.000]   Number two was email.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.240]   And so there's all kinds of things we can do to hack back email that they're
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.120]   using these techniques of folks that reported saving 90% up to 90% of the time
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.840]   they spent on email.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.640]   They no longer spend.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.160]   And there's all kinds of things we can do.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.040]   I'll give you, I'll give you one quick hack for this.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.280]   So the idea here, what we find in terms of, of when you look at where people
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.640]   waste time on email, it's not the replying, it's the checking and
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.120]   specifically the rechecking.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.760]   That's where we waste time on email.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.400]   What does that look like?
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.480]   Well, you get an email, you know, you get this notification on your phone, you
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.360]   open the end email, you read it, you put it away.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.080]   You open the next email, you read it, you put it away.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.000]   Then you say, wait, what was that in that email again?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.760]   So like 20 minutes later, you check it again.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.240]   And then, uh, you know, six hours later you check it again, but you're not
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.120]   taking action on it.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.440]   So that's where people tend to waste the most time on email is the checking and
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.040]   the rechecking.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.960]   So what you want to do from now on is you want to label emails.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.800]   And if you don't know how to label emails, just Google it.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.600]   Every email service provider will let you do this.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.800]   You want to label emails, not by topic.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.280]   Most people use labels by topic.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.640]   That's the wrong way to use labels.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.600]   What you want to do is to label emails by the most important factor from a time
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.520]   management perspective, which is when does it need a reply?
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.240]   When does it need a reply?
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.920]   So if an email, uh, is, oh my God, your house is on fire.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.360]   You have to reply right now.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.880]   It's about less than 1% of emails are actually super urgent, right?
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.120]   Because if your house is on fire, somebody's not going to email you, they're
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.360]   going to call you or do you find a reach you trying to reach you another way.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.400]   If it is absolutely super urgent, 1% of emails, okay, you can respond in the
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.280]   moment, but everything else, 99% of other emails do not respond to the email.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.160]   You know, some people think, okay, if something takes less than two minutes,
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:54.640]   just do it.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.720]   That's a bad rule.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.400]   And that was, that's an antiquated rule because look, most emails take less than
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.920]   two minutes, but when you get a hundred emails per day, well, that's a lot of
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   time if each one takes two minutes.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.400]   So the rest of your emails tend to fall into a few different categories.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.320]   The first is if it's something that never needs to reply, okay, a spam or
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.600]   whatever, but that's easy.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.680]   Just archive it or delete it.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   The rest of your emails fall into two categories, things that you need to reply
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.080]   to today and things that you can reply to sometime this week.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.160]   So everything needs to reply to today.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.200]   When you first check that email, you label it as today.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.760]   Okay.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.480]   And then you put it away.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.000]   Okay.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.680]   Just label us today.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.080]   Put it away.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.480]   The emails that you need to reply to sometime this week, same thing.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.440]   You label it as this week and you put it away.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.840]   Now the goal is that every email you touch, you only touch twice.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.080]   Once when you label, the second time when you return, when you reply, then you go
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:49.400]   back to your time box calendar and you have time in your day to, to reply to
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.680]   only urgent emails, only the emails they need to reply to today.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.000]   Statistically, it's about 20% of your emails.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.560]   The rest of your emails, the other 80% are emails that don't need to reply today.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.800]   They need to reply sometime this week and you schedule time in your calendar for that.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.960]   So for me, it's message Mondays, every Monday I have a three hour block of time
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.200]   when I run through all those emails that can wait.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.680]   Now you say, well, where is the time saving, right?
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.600]   Where am I saving time here?
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.080]   Here's the thing.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.200]   Most people play email ping pong.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.480]   Email ping pong is when you get an email, you send an email, you get an email, you
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.240]   send an email and it goes back and forth and back and forth.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.560]   And they do this without necessarily prioritizing what's urgent and what can
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.200]   wait. And there's a magical thing that happens when you let emails simmer.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:35.760]   About half of those 80% of your emails that need to reply sometime this week, half of
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.800]   them will no longer need to reply.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.280]   Why? How does that happen?
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:39.960]   What's this magic?
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.520]   Turns out people figure out their own stuff, right?
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.400]   Something that was urgent earlier is no longer urgent because it got crushed under
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.600]   the weight of some other priority.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.200]   So when you let the emails that don't need to reply today just simmer for a little
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.280]   bit, just let people figure it out on their own for a little bit and don't reply
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.120]   impulsively based on what's at the top of your to do list or what's at the top of
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.440]   your email inbox or what's easiest to reply to.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.680]   And just let them simmer.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.480]   What you will find is that you'll get a dramatic reduction in the number of emails
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.960]   that actually even need a reply in the first place.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.360]   Furthermore, you won't be checking email all day long anymore.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.440]   What many people don't realize is that they do what's called context switching.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.920]   They work on a big project and then they check email and they work on something
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.520]   else and they check email and the constant checking email all day long because
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.920]   they're worried there might actually be something urgent as opposed to saying,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.280]   look, I check my email twice a day.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.040]   Okay.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.240]   Check in the morning, check in the evening.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.760]   That's it.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.360]   That's it.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.600]   So the rest of the day I can work without distraction.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   I can be indistractable knowing, okay, I'm going to look back at my email inbox
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.360]   at another time, by the way, it doesn't have to be twice a day.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.440]   It can be three times a day, four times a day, but plan it ahead, put it in your
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:39.920]   calendar.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.120]   So you're not doing it.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.440]   What, which is how most people check email when they feel uncertainty, right?
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.360]   They feel that internal trigger of what am I supposed to do?
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:47.720]   I don't know.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.320]   Let me go check my email inbox.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.840]   So my email inbox will tell me what to do.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.480]   Well, that's a terrible way to run your life.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.480]   And there's a side benefit, which is a lot of times we all run to our inbox,
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.640]   refresh, see what's there.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.520]   The longer you wait between refreshes, the higher, the likelihood that some email
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.560]   that you're actually excited about, that's actually important to your life is
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.080]   sitting there.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.120]   And so I've actually found the less I check my email, the more I feel good
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.200]   getting to my email versus going there for just one email.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.480]   It's just not worth it.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.560]   And then I know we both worked in tech.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.800]   I'm sure, you know, the concept of rubber duck debugging, but it reminded me of
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.240]   what you just said, which is, you know, engineers would have a rubber duck that
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.680]   you could talk to, to try to solve an engineering problem.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.520]   And so at my last startup, I gave everyone this little small duck to put on their
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.440]   desk, and I didn't actually expect them to speak out loud to solve their problem
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.880]   with the duck, but it was more of a signal of, "Hey, you could probably think
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.280]   about this and maybe solve it."
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.600]   And that, I didn't do any quantitative measurements, but I want to say at least
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.200]   10% of pings and questions and things went down because it was just a symbol
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.280]   of, "Hey, could you solve this if you just thought about it for a few minutes?"
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:53.360]   Oh my gosh.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.960]   And so what you're doing by saying, "Look, I don't check email every, you
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.480]   know, 30 seconds that I actually, you know, plan my time to check email."
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.920]   What you're doing is training your colleagues to think for themselves.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.960]   Right?
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.240]   Yes.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.400]   You're actually, that's part of the company culture that you're changing.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.000]   You know, there's a whole section in the book on how to build
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.320]   an indistractable workplace.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.720]   And so one of the things that we can do, certainly if you're in a position of
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.440]   leadership, but all of us, you know, by exemplifying what it means to be
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.240]   indistractable, we're actually promoting this culture of helping people work
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.000]   without distraction.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.520]   So doing things like that, right?
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.760]   Telling people, "Look, this is when I'm available."
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.600]   Then they do, or they are prompted to think for themselves as opposed to, it's
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   just so easy to be like, "Hey, answer this stupid question for me so I don't
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:31.960]   have to think."
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.080]   You know, people are cognitive misers, all of us.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.080]   We don't like to expend energy thinking.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.840]   So when you add a bit of friction to contacting you, you get people to
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   actually think for themselves and planning that time to think.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.800]   This is super important for yourself as well.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.120]   I mean, for all of us.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.040]   There are two kinds of work.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.280]   There is what we call reactive work and reflective work.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.440]   Reactive work is reacting to the emails, reacting to notifications, having some
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.840]   kind of external factor tell us what to do with our time.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.560]   And most people live their entire life that way.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.600]   Certainly their work life.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.480]   They love being told what to do because thinking is hard work.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   They just do reactive work all day long.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.800]   Those tend to be low performers.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.520]   High performers make time in their day to think.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.240]   They do what we call reflective work.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.760]   Reflective work is the kind of work that can only be done without distraction.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.720]   Thinking, strategizing, planning can only be done when you are focused.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   So you have to plan at least some time in your day.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.120]   It doesn't have to be your whole day, but 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour of your
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   day has to be set aside for working without distraction, doing that reflective work.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.920]   If you don't, you're going to run real fast in the wrong direction.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.600]   It's hard to block time in your calendar for just thinking.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.680]   It seems so counterintuitive to productivity.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.280]   But when I was running my last company, it was like, you just have to do it.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.880]   Otherwise, you just will never, you'll never make time for that.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.240]   I have, I have what I'll call a burning question.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.680]   It'll make sense in a moment on this last category of
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.160]   preventing distraction with packs.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.280]   So I was reading through it.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.760]   And the thing that really hit me was this burn or burn calendar you have.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:05.400]   And so for anyone listening, you create a calendar of things you want to do for, in
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.960]   your case, it was exercise and you taped a hundred dollar bill and said, if I don't
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.520]   do this thing that I said, I'm going to light, I have to light the hundred dollar
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.320]   bill on fire and for so long, I've heard all of these kind of price based packs
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.120]   where you, you know, gym packed and you have to pay a dollar if you don't go to
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.000]   the gym and none of them felt as visceral as lighting a hundred dollar bill on fire.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.920]   But it also seemed so, you know, of course I can commit to working out.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.000]   So I would do this and if I could hold myself to it.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.480]   So I'm curious, did you ever have to burn the hundred dollar bill?
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.920]   So the reason this technique is so effective, and by the way, this isn't
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.720]   something I just made up out of thin air.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.320]   This is actually, it comes from the most effective smoking cessation study in
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.400]   history, right?
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:50.000]   So the most effective study ever conducted on how to get people to stop smoking was
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.160]   one where people had to put in $150 at stake that if they didn't smoke for six
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.960]   months, as verified by your analysis, they got the $150 back.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.360]   That turned out to be more effective than patches and gums and therapy and all the
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.080]   other smoking cessation programs for this thing that we think, oh my God, cigarettes
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:08.720]   are so addictive.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.520]   Well, it turns out you can buy breaking that addiction with as little as $150.
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:13.320]   How crazy is that?
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.600]   And so that's where this idea came from for this burn or burn technique.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.480]   I want to say as a disclaimer real quick, you have to do this last, okay?
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.360]   You have to do this last.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.560]   If you jump to do this, it oftentimes will backfire because if you haven't
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.120]   prepared yourself for how to master the internal triggers, making time for
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.880]   traction, hacking back the external triggers, and you fall off the horse, it
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.720]   becomes really, really tough to get back on it.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.440]   Okay.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.360]   So this is where you can, I can't emphasize this enough.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   You have to do this after you've done the other three techniques first, but once
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.160]   you've done that, it can be an incredibly effective technique.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.520]   So there's different kinds of packs, effort packs, price packs, and identity
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:50.880]   packs.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.720]   What you're mentioning is a price pack.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.440]   And yeah, for me, you know, I knew I needed to exercise.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.640]   I didn't really like it, but I just needed to do it.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.440]   Right.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.840]   So what I did was I took this calendar, I taped it to my wall and every day there's
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.160]   a hundred dollar bill taped to it.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.480]   And I've been using this technique for what, three and a half, four years now.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.000]   I'm 43 years old.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.520]   I'm in the best shape of my life.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.880]   Uh, I, we used to be clinically obese today.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   I'm not saying this to brag because I don't think I have any good genes or
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.520]   anything.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.160]   It's just that I do this because I intentionally do what I say I'm going to
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:20.280]   do.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.640]   If I'm saying I'm going to exercise, I want to actually do it.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.680]   And so by having that hundred dollar bill that I stare at every day and knowing
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.040]   if, Hey, if I don't do some kind of physical exercise and you know, what you
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.880]   do is up to you.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.960]   For me, it's do 20 pushups, go on a quick run, take a walk around the block, do
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.560]   something physical every single day.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.840]   If I don't do it, I burn the money.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.200]   And I'm happy to report to you that after what, three and a half, four years now,
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.240]   I've never had to burn the money.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:42.720]   Why?
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.840]   Because when I look at it, I say, Oh, okay, fine.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.040]   Let me just do some pushups real quick, or let me just go take a quick walk.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.640]   And so it's that pack that I made with myself.
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.600]   And of course, could I cheat?
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.160]   Yeah, of course I could cheat, but what's my integrity worth to myself, right?
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.320]   Could I look at myself in the mirror knowing I cheated?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.760]   No, it's kind of, you know, that, that's why that, that
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.400]   pact works.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.040]   But again, you have to do this after you've done the other three steps first.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.120]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.040]   For me, I did one once where it was donate to charity.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.840]   And it was like, if you, for any day, you didn't go to the gym, you had to donate
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:12.960]   $5 to charity.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.120]   And I was like, ah, you know what?
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.320]   Donating $5 to charity is not that big of a deal.
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:20.080]   And then I thought about, I thought about what it would take to burn a, burn a
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.760]   hundred dollar bill.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.320]   And I was like, I mean, this has to work.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.120]   Cause I would never, I couldn't possibly do that.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.200]   It would drive me crazy.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.400]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.360]   So yeah, having that visceral reaction of, ah, it's right there.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.120]   Can't you just go do some pushups?
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.520]   Silly, just do it.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.160]   It makes it much more likely that you'll follow through.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.880]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:45.920]   Your support is what keeps this show going to get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and

[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.440]   So there, there's some other great packs in there, so definitely check it out.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.720]   I want to ask a little bit about relationships and, and if you have a
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:05.000]   partner and you want to kind of bring this to light and you want to start
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.440]   talking about this, do you have to do it together?
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.600]   Is it something that can be a problem if one person is like, I really want to be
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.120]   indistractable and the other person's like, you know what?
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.080]   I'm not that big of a, it's fine.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:16.400]   I'm fine.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.440]   I'm fine without doing this.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:23.200]   So I'm not a big proponent of intentionally seeking to change people, but that
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.320]   there's a psychological quirk that we all have called reactants.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.400]   And reactants says that when we are told what to do, we tend to rebel.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.240]   And we all feel this to, to some degree that if your mom ever told you to, you
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.640]   know, take your umbrella, cause it's going to rain, don't tell me what to do.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.200]   I'll figure it out.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.160]   Or if your boss micromanages you, yeah, nobody likes that.
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.320]   We hate being told what to do.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.120]   So intentionally going and saying, Hey honey, guess what?
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.960]   We're going to become indistractable now, right?
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.240]   That's that, that won't work.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.040]   The best thing to do is to lead by example.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.680]   That most of us, you know, whether it's with helping our kids be
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.160]   indistractable, helping our spouses or helping our colleagues at work, be
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.040]   indistractable, the best thing you can do is to be indistractable yourself,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.360]   especially when it comes to our kids, because kids come installed with what I
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.400]   call hypocrisy detection devices.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.520]   I talk to parents all the time and say, Oh, my kid won't stop playing Fortnite
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.840]   or they're always on social media.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.560]   And while they're telling me this, they're checking email on their phone.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.400]   So we can't be hypocrites.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.720]   We have to be able to be indistractable ourselves.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.880]   So that's the best thing you can do.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.960]   And then talking about some of these techniques and asking them, if not to
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.600]   join you on the journey, to help just to understand that you are on this journey
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.520]   to become indistractable and knowing that for yourself as well, we all will get
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.000]   distracted from time to time on the road to becoming indistractable.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.640]   Being indistractable doesn't mean you never get distracted.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.040]   It means that you're the kind of person who strives to do what
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:42.920]   they say they're going to do.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.560]   So you're learning from this process.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.400]   You're iterating.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.080]   You're a scientist, not a drill sergeant.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:51.200]   A scientist makes hypotheses, you test them, and then you see what works and
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.080]   then you run the experiments again to make it better and better over time.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.000]   And so understanding this process is not a one and done type thing, that it is a
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.880]   journey, is a great way to help yourself become indistractable.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.240]   And it tends to be a little infectious, right?
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.560]   And especially if there's something where there's something in it for them too.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.520]   So let me give you an example.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.400]   So let's get a little personal here.
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.960]   We've been talking for almost an hour, so I'll default a little bit here.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   You know, I've been married.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.760]   I just celebrated my 20th anniversary.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.840]   I share the same woman.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.920]   Congratulations.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.600]   Thank you.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.080]   Appreciate it.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.440]   A few years ago, our sex life was suffering because, you know, every night
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.640]   we would go to bed and she would caress her iPhone and I would fondle my computer
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:29.800]   and we weren't being together.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.640]   We weren't being intimate.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:34.200]   We were going to bed later and later, you know, maybe watching Netflix or checking
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.040]   email or doing whatever in bed and we would collapse exhausted and we didn't
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.000]   have time to be intimate.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.160]   So we follow these steps in the book to regain our love life.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.040]   And so we went through step-by-step, okay, what are the internal triggers?
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.880]   Why are we doing this?
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.720]   We made time for traction.
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.080]   We started scheduling a bedtime.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.920]   We hacked back the external triggers.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.320]   We don't sleep with any devices in our bedroom.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.760]   All that stuff is outside.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.520]   And then finally we made a pact.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.120]   And so how do we make this pact?
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.360]   This is called an effort pact.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.480]   I went to the hardware store and I bought a $5 outlet timer.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.400]   And this outlet timer, anything you plug into it will turn off at a certain time
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.240]   of day or night based on what you set.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.480]   And so in our household, every night at 10 PM, the internet
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.920]   shuts off automatically, right?
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.000]   And this is called what we, this is an effort pact.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.520]   Could I turn the internet back on?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.880]   Of course I could, but I'd have to go under my desk, unplug the router,
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.800]   replug it in for this timer thingy.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.600]   And only then can I get online.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.320]   So I could do it of course, but it takes effort, right?
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.000]   So by making that, adding some friction to something I don't want to do with this
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.840]   internet timer, we all kind of know that, Hey, the internet's going to shut off at
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.200]   10 PM, right?
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.920]   Like quick finish what you're doing so that we can have traction as opposed to
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.680]   distraction, doing what we said we're going to do.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:51.400]   Getting to bed on time means we get more sleep and now we have a sex life again.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.680]   That's fantastic for you.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.640]   Congratulations.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:55.320]   Thank you.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:55.600]   Thank you.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:03.320]   So a debate that I often have with my wife is whether we as kind of humans and she
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.480]   would argue women better than men can be good multitaskers or is that just a
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.320]   massive form of distraction?
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:14.200]   So, yeah, so this is one of those productivity orthodoxies that I want to
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.120]   kill the sacred cow, that it is not true that you can't multitask.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.640]   Of course you can multitask.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.160]   We can walk and chew gum at the same time.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.120]   The question is how do we multitask?
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:29.360]   So what you cannot do is you can't have sensory input on the same channel at the
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:29.840]   same time.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   You can't listen to a podcast in each ear and figure out what's going on.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.920]   You can't watch two television shows at the same time.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.840]   You can't do two math problems at the same time, but you absolutely can have what I
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.720]   call multi-channel multitasking.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.120]   So you can definitely listen to a podcast while you're exercising.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.560]   So this is a technique that's called temptation bundling that Katie Milkman
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.560]   research this technique.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.880]   What it basically involves is using a reward from one area of your life to help
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.360]   incentivize you to do something in another area of your life that maybe you don't
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.000]   want to do as much.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.800]   So for me, I never read articles on the web.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:05.560]   So when I'm on my desktop, I never read articles because I know that the New York
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:11.960]   Times and CNN and whatever media company, they designed their product to get me
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:12.520]   hooked, right?
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.760]   To keep me reading and reading and reading them with their clickbait headlines.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.640]   I don't want to do that.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:21.720]   So when I see an article online, I want to read, I save it to an app called pocket.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.360]   And then I only consume those articles while I'm doing something else, like while
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.080]   I'm exercising.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:28.480]   Okay.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.120]   Or while I'm taking a walk, that's the only time I can consume those articles.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:31.960]   Well, how does that happen?
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.200]   It comes with a text to speech feature that will read to you those articles, right?
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.040]   Just like a podcast.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.640]   So that's fantastic, right?
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.080]   So I've taken something that I don't want to do, which is get distracted while I'm
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.760]   on the internet.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:47.560]   And I've used it as a reward in another area of my life by using multi-channel
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.240]   multitasking.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.960]   So you absolutely can multi-channel multitask.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.160]   You can take a phone call or a zoom meeting while you're taking a walk, for
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.480]   example, you can definitely do on different sensory channels and it's a great way to
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.280]   get more out of your day.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:49:58.960]   Okay.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.760]   So we're pretty much at time, but I, I have to believe that if you spent years
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:06.600]   writing a book to solve this problem in your life, you're the kind of person that
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.680]   thinks carefully about other ways to make life better, happier, healthier.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.600]   So I'll end asking if you have any favorite kind of optimizations, life hacks,
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.360]   things that you do that might not be obvious to everyone or normal for everyone.
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.880]   That might not be normal for a lot of what I do is not normal, right?
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.440]   A lot of people think, oh, it's crazy to time box your day.
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.240]   That's too rigid.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.280]   A lot of people think that, uh, oh, here's something that, that I, if you
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:34.960]   have many of us before the, the pandemic found that colleagues were interrupting
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:39.280]   us, now many of us are working at home and now it's our kids, it's our spouses,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.120]   it's our roommates that are other sources of distraction.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.600]   So one thing that we do in our household with my daughter is when she was only six
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.960]   years old, we started using what we call the concentration crown.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.440]   The concentration crown is this headpiece that we got on Amazon for like $5.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.080]   It has these little led lights and when my wife wears a concentration crown and
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   you know, you can't miss it when she's where it's literally lights up when she
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.360]   is wearing that concentration crown.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.720]   We told my daughter, look, when mommy's wearing the concentration crown, that
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.880]   means that she can't be interrupted and she will be with you within a half an
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.440]   hour, right?
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.840]   She would know all her time boxes are half an hour or less.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.080]   And so this works like a charm because look, your kids, give them, give them a
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.320]   break.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.960]   They don't know if you're on your computer, if you're doing something that
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.520]   requires focus and concentration or whether you're watching YouTube videos or
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.760]   something and you can be interrupted.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.000]   So by putting on the concentration crown, what you're doing is interrupting the
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.480]   interruption.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.080]   It works incredibly well with kids.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.600]   It also works really well with spouses.
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.000]   So when I want to interrupt my wife, but I see she's wearing the concentration
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.920]   crown, I also leave her alone and I also have a concentration crown.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.120]   It's not as pretty as hers.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.160]   I just wear a silly hat.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.160]   Anybody can do this.
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.280]   Just look for a crazy looking hat around your house.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.160]   Tell your kids what it's for or your spouse or your roommate, what it's for and
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:49.880]   it works like a charm.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.200]   That's fantastic.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.640]   And, and the last thing I didn't see in the book, you have a whole chapter about
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.920]   raising kids to be indistractable.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.200]   How early do you think that actually starts?
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.160]   And I ask as the father of a 14 month old.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.080]   Yeah, I would say when they're that young, of course, all the screen time is up to
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:07.400]   you.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.600]   I would say it's about the same rule as when a kid is ready to go swimming,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.480]   right?
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.640]   Pools are incredibly dangerous, right?
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.040]   Thousands of children die every year because they drown in a pool.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:19.600]   But as a responsible parent, you're, you're not going to say pools are deadly.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.960]   I'm not gonna let my kid ever learn to swim.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.320]   No, you're going to teach them how to swim.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.880]   And so it's the same rule with, I think, digital technology and specifically how
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.920]   to control their attention.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.240]   So I would say around, you know, five or six, this is a conversation you can have
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.280]   with your kid on, on how to help them learn to become indistractable.
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:38.000]   And look, if you think the world is distracting now, just wait a few years,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:38.360]   right?
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.680]   The world that our kids inhabit is only going to become more distracting.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.560]   So it's absolutely essential that they learn how to control their attention
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.840]   because it truly will be how they choose their life.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.920]   Awesome.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.520]   So I got a few years to practice before we go, where should people find you
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.040]   online?
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.120]   What are you working on right now that people should check out?
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.800]   So my website is near and far.com near a spell like my first name.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.120]   So that's N I R and far.com.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.520]   There's actually a free 80 page indistractable workbook.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.040]   We couldn't fit it into the final edition of the book.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.120]   So it's yours for free.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   It's complimentary and you can download that at near and far and the book is
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.920]   called indistractable, how to control your attention and choose your life.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.720]   And that's available wherever books are sold.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.120]   Links to everything in the show notes near.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.440]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.840]   Oh, my pleasure, Chris.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.480]   Thanks so much.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:26.960]   Wow.
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.240]   I hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.440]   I already know it's going to be one of the episodes I need to go back to and
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.280]   listen myself so I can take notes.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.360]   And that's coming from someone who just read near his book also.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.760]   Okay.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.920]   So to all the listeners out there who've been writing in with questions
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.160]   and sharing your hacks, thank you so much.
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.120]   Please keep them coming.

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.000]   interviewing Brian Kelly, AKA the points guy next week, and I'd love to include
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:54.920]   some of your questions.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.800]   I'm also going to be sharing some of your hacks and wins in the newsletter, which
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.480]   should be coming out this week or next.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.760]   So keep those coming too.
