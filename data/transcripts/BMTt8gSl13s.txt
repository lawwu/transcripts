[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.720]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.040]   Today, my guest is Dr. Gina Poe.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.000]   Dr. Gina Poe is a professor in the Department
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   of Integrative Biology and Physiology
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.800]   at the University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.240]   Her laboratory and research focuses on the relationship
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.080]   between sleep and learning,
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.600]   in particular how specific patterns of brain activity
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.680]   that are present during specific phases of sleep
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.500]   impact our ability to learn and remember
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.280]   specific types of information.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   For instance, procedural information,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.840]   that is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks,
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.160]   as well as encoding of emotional memories
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.540]   and discarding emotional memories.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.640]   Indeed, her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.020]   can act as its own form of trauma therapy,
[00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.680]   discarding the emotional tones of memories.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.340]   In addition, her laboratory focuses on how specific phases
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.000]   of sleep impact things like the release of growth hormone.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   Growth hormone, of course, plays critical roles
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.480]   in metabolism and tissue repair,
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.240]   including brain tissue repair,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.000]   and therefore has critical roles in vitality and longevity.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.120]   Today, you will learn many things about the relationship
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.920]   between sleep, learning, emotionality, and growth hormone.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.240]   One basic but very important takeaway
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.680]   that you'll learn about today, which was news to me,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.000]   is that it's not just the duration
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.880]   and depth of your sleep that matter,
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.220]   but actually getting to sleep
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.680]   at relatively the same time each night
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.240]   ensures that you get adequate growth hormone release
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.940]   in the first hours of sleep.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.480]   In fact, if you require, let's say,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   eight hours of sleep per night,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.320]   but you go to sleep two hours later
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.120]   than your typical bedtime on any given night,
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.520]   you actually miss the window for growth hormone release.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.240]   That's right, getting growth hormone release in sleep,
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.480]   which is absolutely critical
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.560]   to our immediate and long-term health,
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.340]   is not a prerequisite of getting sleep,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.540]   even if we are getting enough sleep.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.360]   As Dr. Poe explains, there are critical brain circuits
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.080]   and endocrine, that is hormone circuits,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.620]   that regulate not just the duration and depth
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.600]   and quality and timing of sleep,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.700]   but when we place our bow to sleep,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.680]   that is when we go to sleep each night,
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.920]   plus or minus about a half hour or so,
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200]   strongly dictates whether or not we will experience
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.600]   all the health promoting,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.740]   including mind promoting benefits of sleep.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.000]   Today's episode covers that
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.220]   and a lot more in substantial detail.
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.280]   You will learn, for instance,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400]   how to use sleep in order to optimize learning,
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.080]   as well as forgetting for those things
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.440]   that you would like to forget.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.520]   So during today's episode,
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.980]   Dr. Gina Poe shares critical information
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.240]   about not just neuroscience,
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.080]   but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain and body
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.760]   that strongly inform mental health,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.200]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   So by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.880]   you'll be far more informed about sleep and how it works,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.400]   the different roles it performs,
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.240]   and you'll have several new actionable steps
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.560]   that you can take in order to improve
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.120]   your mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.800]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.560]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.720]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.260]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.840]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.920]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.720]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   Our first sponsor is Element.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.680]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.240]   That means plenty of salt, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.040]   the so-called electrolytes, and no sugar.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.660]   The electrolytes are critical to the function
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.900]   of every cell in your body,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.560]   in particular, the neurons, the nerve cells.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.480]   So I've talked about before on this podcast,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.760]   neurons, nerve cells, require adequate sodium and potassium,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.460]   as well as magnesium, in order to fire action potentials,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.400]   which are the electrical signals that allow neurons
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.500]   to do everything from generate focus and attention,
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.000]   allow you to learn and generate neuromuscular connection,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.840]   and allow you to exercise or train
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.460]   or do any kind of skilled activity
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.760]   with a high degree of output.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.280]   I take Element about two or three times per day,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.420]   typically once in the morning and again after
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.100]   or during my bout of exercise each day,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.940]   and sometimes an additional one
[00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.680]   if I've sat in a hot sauna and sweat a lot
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.140]   or if the weather is very hot.
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.660]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.080]   that's lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.400]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.800]   Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com/huberman,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.400]   to claim a free sample pack.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.040]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.020]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.480]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.720]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.920]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.080]   When we are sleeping well, all of those things excel.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.960]   And when we are not sleeping well,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960]   all of those things suffer.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.300]   Now, the surface that you sleep on,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.880]   that is the mattress that you sleep on, is critical.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.480]   And Helix understands that everybody
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.400]   has slightly different sleep needs.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.960]   So if you were to go to the Helix site,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.000]   which I invite you to do,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.940]   and take their brief two-minute quiz,
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.240]   it will match your body type and sleep preferences
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.440]   to the perfect mattress for you.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.880]   It will ask you questions, for instance,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.080]   do you sleep on your back or your side or your stomach?
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.700]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.760]   Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   I went and took the sleep quiz at Helix,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.020]   and it matched me to the so-called dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.480]   I started sleeping on a dusk mattress over a year ago,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.200]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.180]   It's completely transformed the depth and duration
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.760]   and quality of my sleep in ways that make me feel
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.760]   far better during the daytime.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.380]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.840]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.200]   take their two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.920]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress,
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.540]   and you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.000]   and two free pillows.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.940]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.700]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.360]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.000]   Now, again, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.600]   physical health, and performance,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.000]   but what many people don't realize
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.140]   is that in order to fall and stay asleep,
[00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.760]   your core body temperature has to drop
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.920]   Conversely, in order to wake up each morning
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.120]   and feel refreshed,
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.160]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.780]   by one to three degrees.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.320]   Therefore, controlling the temperature
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.880]   of your sleeping environment is absolutely key.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.920]   With Eight Sleep, that's very easy to do.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.240]   Depending on whether or not you typically run too cold
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.560]   or too hot during the night,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.740]   you can program your Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.400]   so that it's the optimal temperature,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.520]   not just for you, but for each phase,
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.340]   the early, middle, and late phase of your sleep,
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.640]   and for waking up in the morning.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.140]   In fact, you can even control the temperature
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.420]   of your Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.120]   differentially across the mattress
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   if you're sleeping alongside somebody else.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.320]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.600]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman

[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.520]   The Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.760]   with Momentous Supplements.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.080]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.280]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.960]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.480]   livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.860]   And I should just mention that the library
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.040]   of those supplements is constantly expanding.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.160]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.960]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Gina Poe.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.880]   Dr. Gina Poe, welcome.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.780]   - Thank you.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.360]   - I've really been looking forward to this conversation
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.300]   because I'm familiar with your work,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.000]   and I know that many people are going to be excited
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.200]   to learn about your work as it relates to sleep,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.840]   as it relates to problem solving, creativity,
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.840]   addiction and craving, relapse,
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.720]   and a number of other important topics.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   So to start things off, I would love for you
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.620]   to educate us a bit about this thing
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.120]   that we are all familiar with,
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   and yet very few of us understand, which is sleep.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.580]   And if you would, could you describe the various phases
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.400]   of sleep that exist, what distinguished them,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.040]   and perhaps frame this within the context
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.720]   of what would a perfect night's sleep look like?
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.560]   - Okay.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.740]   - How long would it last, more or less?
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.560]   And what would the biology look like?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.640]   What is a perfect night's sleep?
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.300]   - Oh yeah, that's a great question.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.360]   All right, so sleep is really different from wakefulness,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.240]   and in fact, can't be replaced by any state of wakefulness
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.160]   that we've been able to come up with so far.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.560]   Our brain chemistry is completely different,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.320]   and in the different stages of sleep,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.440]   which there is non-REM and REM
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.200]   are the two major states of sleep,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.020]   and every animal we've studied so far
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.600]   seems to have both of those states.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.980]   Anyway, those two states are entirely different
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.960]   from one another, too.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.920]   And even within non-REM, there are three states.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   Stage one, which is what you slip into
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.840]   when you're first falling asleep, it's dozing.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.340]   There's kind of an interesting rhythm
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.280]   that goes on in the brain.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.160]   It's kind of a fast gamma rhythm.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.760]   And then there's stage two, which is a really cool state.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   We sort of used to ignore sleep researchers
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.520]   because it was a transient state between wakefulness
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.760]   and the deep stage three, slow wave sleep,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.000]   which is the most impressively different.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.100]   And then, and between that and REM sleep.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.600]   So stage two, I'll talk a little bit more about,
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.620]   and then the deep slow wave sleep state,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.320]   which is when big slow waves sweep through our brain,
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.480]   and now we realize that it cleans our brain.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.160]   One of the things that those big slow waves do
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.060]   is cleans our brain and does other really important things
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.960]   to restore us from a day of wakefulness.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.240]   And then REM sleep, which is the most popular
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.940]   because that's where we have the most active dreams
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.760]   and when you wake up someone out of REM sleep,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.960]   they'll almost always report having dreamed
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.600]   something really bizarre.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.920]   That's called REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   So those are the four states of sleep, of human sleep.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.720]   And we cycle through them every 90 minutes or so.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.480]   When we go to sleep, say 10, 10, 30, 11 o'clock,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.600]   our first REM sleep period comes about 105 minutes
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.440]   after we fall asleep and lasts about 20 minutes.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.760]   Actually, it comes about 95 minutes
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.820]   and lasts 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.140]   And then we start over again.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.920]   And we have about five of those per night
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.360]   for a perfect night's sleep,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.980]   four or five, something like that.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.860]   So a perfect night's sleep is seven and a half, eight hours.
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.780]   There was a really great study that put people
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.920]   in a semi darkened room with nothing but the bed
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.140]   for 12 hours every day for a month.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.880]   And what people did initially is,
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.220]   because we're in a sleep deprived nation,
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.720]   is that they slept a lot more than usual,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.300]   like 10 or 11 hours of the 12.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.680]   And then they leveled off after a week or two
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.940]   to about eight hours and 15 minutes of sleep.
[00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.940]   So you actually can't oversleep.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.440]   I mean, they had nothing else to do but sleep
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.360]   and they would round off to, on average,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.140]   eight hours and 15 minutes a night.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.500]   And then they spend the rest of the time
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.140]   twiddling their thumbs, humming tunes, daydreaming.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.200]   - I want to get back to the contour of a perfect night's sleep
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.500]   but I'm intrigued by this idea that people can't oversleep.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.820]   I'm often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.220]   and whether or not sleeping too long, excuse me,
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.580]   can make us groggy the next day.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.960]   Is there anything to that?
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.900]   And how does one determine how long they should sleep
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.540]   on average? - On average, yeah.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.740]   Well, that's interesting because different people
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.000]   seem to need different amounts of sleep
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.420]   but we don't really even know exactly what sleep is for.
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.580]   So what they need is, you know, kind of,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.680]   it's, you know, murky.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.660]   So we do know a lot of things that sleep does now for us
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.980]   but we don't know how long those things take.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.380]   So how long we need to sleep is also just a big question mark
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.100]   but some people don't feel rested
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.820]   until they've slept nine hours.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.940]   Some people don't feel rested after three or four and a half.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.040]   But most people, if they consistently deprive themselves
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.780]   of sleep so that they're only sleeping four,
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.420]   four and a half hours a night,
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.220]   build up a cognitive deficit that just builds up over time.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.700]   The more nights you have with sleep deprivation,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.720]   the more cognitive deficit you have.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.180]   And so you need sleep, again, to sleep more to recover.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.020]   Now, the question you had about--
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.900]   - Can you overs-- - Can you oversleep?
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.220]   - Can you sleep to the point where it's too much?
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.300]   You know, that we, growing up when I was in high school,
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.100]   my girlfriend's dad had this belief that no one
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.220]   should sleep in past 6 a.m.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.400]   So he would wake all the,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.460]   there were two children in that home,
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.260]   he would wake up the kids in that house.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.900]   He had this thing against oversleeping
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.100]   regardless of when people went to sleep.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.780]   And I always thought that was an interesting mentality.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.820]   - Yeah, it's not terrible, actually,
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.380]   because what that will do is it'll put you,
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.660]   make you sleep the next night to get to bed on time.
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.420]   So it'll build up your homeostatic need
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.620]   if you wake up too early.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.100]   But, so I don't think you can oversleep,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.580]   but people who sleep a lot,
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.500]   like people who sleep over nine hours,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.020]   it's probably indicative of some other problem,
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.940]   because in fact, if you have a lot of different conditions,
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.420]   it will cause you to sleep a lot more,
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.380]   probably because what it does is it interferes
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.160]   with your efficient sleep, the efficiency of your sleep.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.380]   So if you find yourself sleeping consistently
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.940]   nine hours plus every night,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.500]   then you might want to consult a doctor
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.680]   about maybe what else it might be.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.180]   It could be cancer, it could be sleep apnea,
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.100]   that just affects a lot of people.
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.100]   It could be that your sleep is super inefficient
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.460]   because you're snoring a lot more than you know,
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.380]   or you're waking up a lot more than you know every night.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.420]   So you might want to sleep steady
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.180]   just to see how your sleep is
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.300]   and then see what else might be causing you to sleep so much.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.700]   - And that wouldn't be if somebody is sleeping
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.240]   nine or 10 hours every once in a while.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.940]   You mean if they're consistently sleeping
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.460]   for more than nine hours?
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.700]   - If they feel like they need it
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.860]   in order to function cognitively the next day,
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.260]   it might be that your sleep is just not efficient
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.780]   and you might want to look into why that's the case.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.820]   - Interesting.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.580]   Forgive me for the anecdote, but I can't resist.
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.940]   Years ago, I went to an acupuncturist
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.100]   and he gave me these red pills
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.240]   of which I don't know what they contained.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.900]   But I took them because he told me
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.460]   they would help with my sleep.
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.880]   And I would fall asleep about 30 minutes after taking them.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.000]   And I would have incredibly, excuse me, vivid dreams.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.480]   And I'd wake up four or five hours
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.300]   after having gone to sleep feeling completely rested.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.800]   Something that I've never really experienced
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.040]   on a consistent basis.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.840]   I want to do mass spec on these pills.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.140]   I still have no idea what was in them whatsoever.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.320]   - I want to do mass spec on these pills too.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.160]   - Exactly.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.680]   Some people thought that perhaps they had GHB,
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.360]   gamma hydroxybutyrate, which is by the way, an illegal drug.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.200]   It can kill you.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.800]   It's not something you want to take.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.700]   - No, that's not good.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.080]   - But anyway, if ever someone can figure out
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.180]   what the red pills were, I'll be very-
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.020]   - That's really great.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.420]   - And this is not a red pill of the other sort red pill.
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.240]   This is just the red sleep pills.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.080]   - Interesting.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.400]   I mean, it could have been even a placebo effect
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.020]   because placebo is extremely strong.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.240]   - Although I don't know,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   there was really something to these red pills.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   So shout out to the acupuncturists and the Eastern medicine.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.680]   But to return to this idea of the architecture
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.960]   of a perfect night's sleep.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.440]   So you said we fall asleep, the first 90 minutes of sleep,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.300]   REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.540]   will arrive at about 95 minutes in.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.060]   Does that mean that the rest of that 90 minutes
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.400]   is consumed with slow wave sleep?
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.560]   - Yeah, non-REM sleep.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.760]   - Okay, and what about the sleep where we are lightly asleep
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.600]   and we might have a dream that has us
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   somehow thinking about movement
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.480]   or that we jolt ourselves awake?
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240]   That often happens early in the night, right?
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.360]   - Yeah, that's the first stage,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   stage one and stage two of sleep.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.740]   And stage two of sleep is really cool
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.700]   because that has something called sleep spindles
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.880]   and K complexes.
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.120]   And what sleep spindles are,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.120]   are a little of activity that's 10 to 15 Hertz in frequency.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.080]   It's a conversation between the thalamus and the cortex.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.840]   The thalamus is the gateway to consciousness
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.280]   and the neocortex processes all our cognition.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.280]   And so it's these spindles, they're called sleep spindles.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.520]   And if you wake up out of that state,
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.240]   you will often report a dream,
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.520]   like a hallucination style dream.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.760]   It won't be a long dream report
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.200]   like you have out of REM sleep,
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.820]   but it will be some hallucination state.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.700]   And during, while we're falling asleep,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.520]   one of the reasons we call it falling asleep
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.400]   is because in stage one and stage two,
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.320]   our muscles are relaxing.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.560]   And if there's part of our brain that's conscious enough
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.880]   to sort of recognize that relaxation,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   we'll feel like we're falling and we'll jerk awake.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   So often that hallucination,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.300]   it's called hypnagogic hallucination,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.980]   will feel like it'll include some falling aspect
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.520]   that we'll wake up out of.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   - That's really interesting to me.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.920]   I've long felt that sensation
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.060]   of almost like dropping back into my head,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.760]   so much so that if I elevate my feet just slightly
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.000]   and I tilt my head back just slightly
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:51.840]   in order to go to sleep,
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.240]   I find that I fall asleep much faster.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.560]   But it does feel as if I'm going to fall,
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   like almost going to do a backward somersault.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   I actually really like the sensation
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.840]   and usually because it proceeds falling deeply asleep.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.720]   - Yeah, that's really interesting.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.000]   Somebody has to do a study of elevated feet.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   - Yeah, there's a little bit on body position and sleep
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.540]   and some of the washout that we'll talk about.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.700]   So early in the night,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.840]   you've got these lighter stages of sleep,
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.040]   less rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.960]   What can we say about the dreams that occur
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   during the say first and second 90 minute cycles of sleep?
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.640]   Are they quite different than the patterns of sleep
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.480]   and dreaming that occur later in the night
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.460]   or toward morning?
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.840]   - Well, okay, that's an interesting question.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.000]   There's a lot of facets to it.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.080]   There is some evidence that the first four hours of sleep
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.400]   are very important for memory processing.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   And in fact, if you've learned something new that day
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.920]   or have experienced a new sensory motor experience,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.140]   then your early sleep dreams
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.700]   will incorporate that experience
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.240]   much more than the later sleep dreams.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.320]   Later as that memory gets consolidated
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.920]   from the early structures,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.200]   which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.680]   to the cortex in a distributed fashion,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.400]   that memory seems to move from that hippocampus
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.600]   to the cortex and also the dreams
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.660]   that incorporate that memory also move later in the night.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.440]   So nobody knows why,
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.280]   but there was a great study by Sidarto Ribeiro
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.200]   who studied the consolidation of memories
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.720]   from the hippocampus to the cortex in a rat
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.640]   across the period of a full day's sleep
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.280]   because rats sleep in the daytime.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.360]   And he found that each subsequent REM sleep period
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.980]   moved that memory from the hippocampus
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.960]   to the first area that projects to it
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.320]   and then the second area and then the third area.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.880]   And you can see the memory moving
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.760]   throughout the sleep period.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.340]   - Very cool, I have to read that study.
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.800]   So there's a number of different hormones
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.080]   associated with the different stages of sleep.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.280]   We know that melatonin is a hormone--
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   - Of nighttime.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.800]   - Of nighttime that makes us sleepy.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.200]   What about growth hormone release?
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.680]   When does that occur during sleep?
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   - So growth hormone release happens all day long
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.080]   and all night long,
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.780]   but the deep slow wave sleep that you get,
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.040]   the very first sleep cycle
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.120]   is when you get a big bolus of growth hormone release
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.040]   and in men and women equally.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.840]   And if you miss that first deep slow wave sleep period,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.400]   you also miss that big bolus of growth hormone release.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.260]   And you might get ultimately across the day
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.260]   just as much overall growth hormone release,
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.760]   but androchronologists will tell you
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.360]   that big boluses do different things
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.500]   than a little bit eked out over time.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   So that is when we know there's also a big push
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.960]   to synthesize proteins.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.360]   So that's when the protein synthesis part
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.160]   that builds memories, for example, in our brain
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.120]   happens in that first cycle of sleep.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.600]   So you don't want to miss that,
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.640]   especially if you've learned something really big
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.280]   and needs more synaptic space to encode it.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.960]   - How would somebody miss that first 90 minutes?
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.080]   - Sleep deriving themselves.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.920]   Yeah, so you can--
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.020]   - So let's say I normally go to sleep at 10 p.m.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.800]   and then from 10 to 1130 would be this first phase of sleep
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.520]   and that's when the big bolus of growth hormone
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.480]   would be released.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   Does that mean that if I go to sleep instead
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.200]   at 1130 or midnight that I miss that first phase of sleep?
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.440]   Why is it not the case that I get that first phase of sleep
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.840]   just simply starting later?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.200]   - It is a beautiful clock that we have in our body
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.920]   that knows when things should happen.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.520]   And it's every cell in our body has a clock
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.720]   and all of those clocks are normally synchronized
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.980]   and the circadian clocks are synchronized.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.680]   And so our cells are ready to respond
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.240]   to that growth hormone release at a particular time.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.320]   And if we miss it,
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.560]   and it's a time in relation to melatonin also.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.240]   So if you miss it, yeah,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.400]   you might get some growth hormone release,
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.680]   but it's occurring at a time
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.900]   when your clock has already moved to the next phase.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.820]   And so it's just a clock thing.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.480]   - Yeah, I don't think we can overstate the importance
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.580]   of what you just described.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.740]   And to be honest, despite knowing a bit
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.980]   about the sleep research in circadian biology,
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.720]   this is the very first time that I've ever heard this,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.840]   that if you normally go to sleep at a particular time
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.280]   and growth hormone is released in that first phase of sleep,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.960]   that you can't simply initiate your sleep bout later
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.560]   and expect to capture that first phase of sleep.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.560]   That's incredible and I think important.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.480]   And as many listeners are probably realizing,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.600]   also highly actionable.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   So what this means is that we should have
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.480]   fairly consistent bedtimes
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.640]   in addition to fairly consistent wake times.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.900]   Is that right? - Yes, exactly.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.800]   And in fact, one of the best markers
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.760]   of good neurological health when we get older
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.780]   is consistent bedtimes.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.860]   - Wow, okay.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.380]   I don't want to backtrack,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.500]   but I did write down something that I think is important
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.460]   for me to resolve or for you to resolve.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.920]   So I'm going to ask this.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.980]   People that sleep nine hours or more,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.500]   perhaps that reflecting an issue,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.560]   some underlying issue, perhaps,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   is being a teenager or an adolescent
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.400]   and undergoing a stage of development
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.360]   where there's a lot of bodily and brain growth
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.200]   and exception to that.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.260]   Because I don't recall sleeping a ton when I was a teenager.
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:36.640]   I had a ton of energy,
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.240]   but I know a few teenagers and they sleep a lot.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.000]   Like they'll just sleep and sleep and sleep and sleep.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.840]   Should we let them sleep and sleep and sleep?
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.680]   - Yes, let them sleep.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.000]   - Okay, so that's the one exception.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.960]   What about us? - Just like babies.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.600]   When you're developing something in your brain
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.920]   or the rest of your body,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.040]   you really need sleep to help organize that.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.920]   I mean, sleep is doing really hard work
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.360]   in organizing our brains and making it develop right.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:03.900]   And if we deprive ourselves of sleep,
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.400]   we will actually also, just like I said,
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.320]   we have a daily clock.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.960]   We also have a developmental clock
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.640]   and we can miss a developmental window
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   if we don't let ourselves sleep extra like we need to.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.160]   - What other things inhibit growth hormone release
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.360]   or other components of this first stage of sleep?
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.680]   In other words, if I go to sleep religiously
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.720]   every night at 10 p.m.,
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.080]   are there things that I perhaps do in the preceding hours
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.480]   or the preceding day, like ingest caffeine or alcohol
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.120]   that can make that first stage of sleep less effective,
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.000]   even if I'm going to sleep at the same time?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.740]   - Alcohol definitely will do that
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.120]   because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   and it even suppresses some of that stage two
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.520]   transition to REM with those sleep spindles.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.400]   And those sleep spindles,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.080]   we didn't talk about their function yet,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.680]   but they're really important for moving memories
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.600]   to our cortex.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.800]   It's a unique time when our hippocampus,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.020]   sort of like the RAM of our brains,
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.300]   writes it to a hard disk, which is the cortex.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.960]   And it's a unique time when they're connected.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.700]   So if you don't want to miss that,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.900]   you don't want to miss REM sleep
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.200]   when it's also a part of the consolidation process
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.320]   and schema changing process.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.040]   And alcohol before we go to sleep, we'll do that.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.060]   Until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies,
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.660]   it will affect our sleep badly.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.840]   - So probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.160]   within the four to six hours preceding sleep,
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.320]   given the half life, or at all would be better,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.520]   but I know some people refuse to go that way.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.480]   - Maybe a little bit is okay.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.700]   I don't know what the dose response is,
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.780]   but there are studies out there you can look at.
[00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.380]   - Great. - Yeah.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.220]   - So we're still in the first stage of sleep
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.760]   and I apologize for slowing us down,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.000]   but it sounds like it's an incredibly important
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.500]   first phase of sleep.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.540]   What about the second and third 90 minute blocks of sleep?
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.600]   Is there anything that makes those unique?
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.200]   What is their signature besides the fact
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.940]   that they come second and third in the night?
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.960]   - There's more and more REM sleep the later the night we get.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.300]   There's also a change in hormones.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.360]   You know, the growth hormone and melatonin levels
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.760]   are starting to decline, but other hormones are picking up.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.680]   So it is a really different stage
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.660]   that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.600]   And I think that's the stage many studies are showing
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.680]   that those are the times in sleep
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.080]   when the most creativity can happen.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.320]   That's when our dreams can incorporate
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.880]   and put together old and new things together into a new way.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.460]   And our schema are built during that time.
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.420]   So yeah, we can change our minds best
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.420]   during those phases of sleep.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.480]   - Could you elaborate a little bit more on schema?
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.920]   I don't think anyone on this podcast
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.420]   has ever discussed schema.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.340]   I'm a little bit familiar with schema
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.340]   from my courses on psychology, but it's been a while.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.840]   So maybe if you could just refresh mine
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.680]   and everyone else's memory.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.860]   - Well, it's still a concept.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.140]   - Sure, but how do you define schema, right?
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   I think of schema as like we have a schema of Christmas,
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:17.740]   right, we have all kinds of ideas that we sew together
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:20.420]   and call Christmas, a holiday season
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.620]   in the Northern hemisphere, it's cold.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.660]   We have Santa Claus and reindeer and jingle bells
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.500]   and even things that are false
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.300]   but we normally associate with Christmas presents,
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.540]   family gathering, when it is, all of this stuff
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.960]   is sewn together into one, there's a thread linking them all
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.020]   and we can just give ourselves a list of words
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.740]   and none of them contain the word Christmas
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.180]   and then ask people later, give them another list of words
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:51.940]   and include the word Christmas and they'll say,
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.740]   "Oh yeah, that word was there."
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.700]   Because in their minds, they brought up that word Christmas
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.740]   because it's part of that whole schema.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.420]   So that's what, it's sort of a related,
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.100]   a lot of related concepts, I guess.
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.260]   - Can I think about it sort of like on the desktop
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.740]   of my computer would scare some people
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.660]   but it's just a ton of folders.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.100]   But each of the folder names mean something very clear
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.780]   and specific to me and inside of those folders
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.000]   are collections of things that make sense
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.180]   in terms of how they're batched.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.020]   Is that one way to think about it?
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.740]   - Exactly, no, that's a great way to think of it
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.320]   and when you're in REM sleep in the later parts of the night
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.300]   and that transition to REM, that's when your computer
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.740]   of your brain is opening folders and comparing documents,
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.020]   seeing if there, is there anything the same,
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.100]   these two documents look very much the same
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.940]   but there's a little bit of difference
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.780]   and it can link those conceptually
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.660]   so that that's probably one of the origins of creativity
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.300]   is finding things that are related,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   maybe just linked a little bit
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.640]   and you can find that link and strengthen it
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.420]   if it makes your schema interesting and different, yeah.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.060]   - Very interesting.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.500]   Many people, including myself, tend to wake up
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.900]   maybe once during the middle of the night
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.780]   to use the restroom.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.260]   I've tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:11.260]   I've heard also that the impulse to urinate,
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.820]   forgive the topic, but a lot of people deal with this.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.780]   So the impulse to urinate is also dictated
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.520]   by how quickly you drink fluid, not just the total volume.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.840]   So I've switched to sipping fluids more slowly
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.660]   for my last beverage of the day, which seems to help
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.900]   but the point here is that I think a lot of people wake up
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.740]   once in the middle of the night,
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.160]   oftentimes to use the restroom
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.540]   but oftentimes just around 3 a.m.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.500]   and might be up for a few minutes,
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.780]   hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright light,
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.420]   which can cause more wakefulness,
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.360]   but then go back to sleep.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.060]   Is there any known detriment
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.780]   to this middle of the night waking
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.820]   or should we consider it a normal feature
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.740]   for some people's sleep architecture?
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.300]   - Yeah, I think we shouldn't worry about it actually.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.940]   I think sleep is really incredibly
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.900]   well homeostatically regulated
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.160]   and so really don't worry about how much you're sleeping
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.120]   as long as you're not intentionally depriving yourself of sleep
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.380]   by doing something really rewarding and exciting
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.800]   because even that is stressful to your body
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.540]   and deprives you of a lot of things we're talking about.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.260]   So don't worry about it.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.580]   It's absolutely normal to wake up
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.920]   at least once in the middle of the night
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.260]   to go to the bathroom
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.260]   and as long as you can get back to sleep
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.860]   in a reasonable amount of time,
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.700]   or even if it takes you an hour,
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.340]   don't worry about it as long as you have a lifestyle
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.960]   that allows you to then make up that sleep
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.020]   either the next morning or the next night
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.640]   or going to bed a little earlier.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.660]   - So if I understand correctly,
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.520]   there's a little bit of asymmetry to sleep
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.120]   that catching that first phase of sleep,
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.760]   it's like you either get it or you don't
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.480]   and you have to get it by going to sleep
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.800]   essentially the same time each night,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.380]   maybe plus or minus 15 minutes or so.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.300]   But then if I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.760]   and go back to sleep, I can not catch up
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.540]   but I can gather all the sleep that I would have gotten
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.160]   had I just slept the whole way through the night.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.680]   Is that right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.860]   And we don't know actually the answer
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.760]   to whether or not the sleep in the middle
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.140]   between that early sleep and the late sleep
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.960]   is in fact different for another reason.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.080]   And whether depriving yourself of sleep
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.240]   from say one to 2.30 in the morning
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.320]   is bad in a different way, we don't know.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.400]   - Well, I suppose I am the experiment in that case
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.280]   because I do tend to wake up once per night
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.020]   and I've sort of come to recognize it
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.840]   as part of my normal sleep architecture.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.040]   I don't obsess over it.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.000]   I do notice that when I go back to sleep
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.260]   and especially toward morning,
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.240]   that my sleep is incredibly deep.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.740]   My dreams are incredibly vivid.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.960]   I don't always remember them,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.380]   but what is unique perhaps about the architecture of dreams
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.500]   and sleep in the, let's say the last third of the night
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.200]   or the second half of the night?
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.480]   - Right, yeah, in the second half of the night,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.000]   we have longer REM sleep periods
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.240]   and those are considered the deepest sleep
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.360]   even though slow wave sleep,
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.200]   big slow wave is considered deep, it is deep.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.020]   - Yeah, they call slow wave sleep deep sleep
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.260]   and REM sleep rapid, I mean,
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.720]   but now you're telling me that REM sleep
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.240]   is actually the deepest. - The deepest.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.160]   - Okay, there needs to be a new nomenclature
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.000]   of sleep researchers. - Yeah, I know,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.560]   you really shouldn't call it deep or not deep.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.640]   - No, no, please.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.600]   - The reason why you call slow wave sleep deep sleep
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   is because it's difficult to arouse people out of that state
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.880]   and when you do arouse them out of that state,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.000]   they're most often confused
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.600]   and just want to go back into sleep
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.040]   and can go back pretty easily.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.000]   If you arouse someone out of REM sleep,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.360]   they're more likely to report something
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.640]   that was really kind of almost like wakefulness.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.360]   It was so vivid, but in fact,
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   if you give someone a non-threatening kind of stimulation,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.420]   like somebody dropping keys or a ping
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.440]   or something like that, instead of waking,
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.160]   that same volume will wake someone up out of non-REM sleep,
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.640]   but out of REM sleep and instead lengthen the amount of time
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.680]   or make it even more dense,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.200]   your rapid eye movements more dense
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.560]   and often people will incorporate that sound
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.120]   into their dreams.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   So the body and brain are somehow conscious of the sound
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.680]   and I've heard also smells
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.120]   can even make it into our dreams in REM sleep,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.480]   but that it doesn't arouse us from sleep.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.840]   - It doesn't arouse us as often, yeah.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.960]   And maybe one of the reasons why REM sleep is deeper
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.360]   is especially in adults and older people
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.440]   that deep slow wave sleep goes away.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.280]   So it's not as deep, it's not as big,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.960]   the slow waves aren't as large,
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.720]   which is probably problematic, but we're not sure.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   And so then REM sleep becomes the deepest stage.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.960]   Actually in children, it's kind of a toss up
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.980]   because it's really hard to wake them up
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.400]   out of that deep slow wave sleep.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.760]   And in fact, fire alarms don't wake them up,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.300]   even really loud fire alarms out of that state of sleep.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.620]   So that's why they're trying to change fire alarms
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.960]   so that instead of something
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.040]   that the kids don't associate with anything,
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.120]   like the, whatever they don't associate with,
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.200]   it says their name or something else
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.920]   that may be less loud, but more salient to them
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.840]   and will wake them up.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   - I don't know, having carried sleeping children
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.000]   in from the car, I don't know that I want children
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.200]   to start waking up from sleep
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.120]   'cause that's one of the best things when you get home
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.760]   and the kids are asleep in the backseat,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.920]   you can literally throw them over your shoulder,
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.040]   gently of course, and put them to sleep
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.120]   and they are completely out.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.340]   - Yeah, it's wonderful.
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.440]   - It is wonderful.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   One of nature's gifts.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.960]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.860]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.320]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.680]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.580]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.260]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.480]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.080]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.160]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.280]   once or usually twice a day is that it gets me
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.760]   the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.400]   Our gut is very important, it's populated by gut microbiota
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.160]   that communicate with the brain, the immune system,
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.560]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.200]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.220]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.880]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.440]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.360]   a number of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.240]   that make sure that all of my foundational
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.680]   nutritional needs are met and it tastes great.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.140]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:19.540]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.520]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.840]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.120]   while you're on the road, in the car,
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.420]   on the plane, et cetera.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.820]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.500]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.880]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.860]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.340]   So this enhanced volume or proportion
[00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.420]   of rapid eye movement sleep in the second half of the night
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.160]   relates to more elaborate dreams.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.520]   We are paralyzed during REM sleep, correct?
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.600]   - Yes, normally paralyzed and that's really good
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.560]   because that's the time when we're actively dreaming
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.340]   storyline dreams and we could hurt ourselves.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.920]   We're actually really cut off from the outside world
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.560]   in terms of, you know, responding to say this table
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.360]   or a window or a door.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.520]   And so different from sleepwalking,
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.880]   which is out of slow wave sleep, out of slow wave sleep,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.620]   that sleepwalking is a mixture
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.000]   between sleep and wakefulness.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.740]   So you actually will respond to the door.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.240]   You can cook a full meal,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.680]   drive your car while you're in deep slow wave sleep.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.300]   It's scary because you never know what you're going to do.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.180]   You don't have voluntary control over it.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.880]   You have no conscious control over it,
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.520]   but you can actually safely navigate some situations
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.040]   in sleepwalking and actually have a conversation.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.680]   Although it may not make much sense
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.200]   when you're sleep talking.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.120]   In REM sleep, you're not processing the outside world.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.280]   And instead, when you're acting out your dreams,
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   you could be doing things like walking
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.680]   through a plate glass window or falling off of,
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.240]   you know, down the stairs, things like that.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.620]   So you really want your muscles to be inactivated
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.640]   during REM sleep.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.660]   Otherwise you will act out those dreams
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.980]   and really hurt yourself or your bed partner.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.700]   - What about sleep talking?
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.700]   Or talking in sleep?
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.020]   I don't know how many relationships
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.280]   have been saved by sleep talking,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.860]   but I'm guessing a few have been destroyed.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:22.680]   And I'm guessing that talking in sleep could have meaning
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.020]   or perhaps has no meaning just as dreams
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.500]   could have meaning or no meaning, as we recall them.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   - Yeah, do not take sleep talking seriously.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.980]   No matter what people say,
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.020]   it doesn't necessarily reflect truth.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.320]   So it's not like you're being more truthful
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.520]   when you're sleep talking.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.180]   - You just saved a number of relationships.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.060]   [laughing]
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.860]   - I'm not directing this at anyone in particular,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.640]   but I guarantee you just did, noted.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.980]   So as people start to approach morning
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.180]   or the time when they normally would wake up,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.780]   I've heard that it's important to, if possible,
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.180]   complete one of these 90 minute cycles prior to waking up.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.220]   That is, if you set your alarm for halfway through
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.380]   one of these 90 minute cycles that come late
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.740]   in the night of sleep, that it can lead
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.960]   to rather groggy patterns of waking.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.540]   So I'll just ask you directly, do you use an alarm clock?
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.760]   - I do not.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.540]   Thankfully, I'm in a line of work
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.980]   that doesn't require me normally
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.540]   to do anything at any particular time.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.220]   I do it when I do it, unless I have to catch a plane
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.180]   and then I always set my alarm just in case.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.200]   - Well, as a fellow academic, I can tell you
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.560]   there are plenty of punishing features
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.220]   about being an academic scientist
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.060]   that offset the fact that you don't have
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.420]   to use an alarm clock, but it is nice
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.620]   that you can often set your own schedule.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.620]   So would you recommend that, if possible,
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.260]   that people not use an alarm clock?
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.700]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.260]   If you can just listen to your body
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.100]   and wake up when you need to wake up, that would be great.
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.020]   But one of the reasons why we have such a grogginess,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.760]   it's called sleep inertia, when we wake up
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.460]   out of the wrong state, which is deep slow wave sleep,
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.140]   is because I liken it to like a washing machine
[00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.220]   cycle, this 90 minute cycle is like a washing machine cycle.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.860]   And the first part is to add water, right?
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.440]   And then your clothes are soaking wet.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.940]   You don't wanna open the washing machine
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.620]   and try and function, put them on and wear them around
[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.220]   while they're soaking wet and full of soap.
[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.260]   So you have to wait until the cycle is through
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.580]   before you can, well, actually, let's put it
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.220]   in the dryer too, before you wanna wear them.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.000]   So yeah, you can function.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.700]   It just takes a little while for those clothes,
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.060]   that brain to dry out so you can actually function well,
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.560]   but it's better to wait through the whole cycle is complete.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.560]   And so that's why you want to set that 90 minute alarm clock.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.720]   And again, that's around 90 minutes
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.060]   because the first stage of sleep,
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.260]   the first cycle of sleep is actually a little longer,
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.740]   more like 105, 110 minutes,
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.500]   but then the second ones and third ones,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.320]   they get sort of shorter and shorter as the night goes on.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.940]   And in the last few cycles,
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.700]   you're just doing the end to REM sleep cycle,
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.800]   which takes less time.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.200]   And if you wake up out of REM sleep,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.720]   it's usually no problem cognitively.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   You're good to go.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.460]   - Are you a fan of sleep trackers?
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.540]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.380]   - Do you use one?
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.200]   - I have one on, I don't take,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.560]   I don't live my life by them
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.920]   because they are, the best ones right now
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   are about 70% effective at staging your sleep.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:38.360]   So 70%, it's okay, it's okay.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.320]   But take it with a grain of salt is what I'm saying.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.480]   - Yeah, I've tried various ones
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.000]   and I compare the mattress based one to,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.800]   actually wear it on my ankle instead of my wrist.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.000]   But, and I do find it informative,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.360]   but a colleague of mine at Stanford, Ali Crum,
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   who works on mindset and belief effects,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.480]   talked to me about a study they did
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.200]   where people often will bias their sense
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.640]   of daytime wakefulness based on their sleep score
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.420]   more than their subjective score.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.480]   In other words, if they were told
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.400]   they got a poor night's sleep,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.880]   even if they got a great night's sleep,
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.200]   and this was of course measured in the sleep lab,
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.800]   so they were able to compare,
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.040]   people report feeling more groggy.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.640]   And the opposite is also true,
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.400]   that if it says 100% or 90% on your sleep score,
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.360]   then people go, oh, I feel great,
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.920]   even though they might not have slept well.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.360]   So this speaks to the, I don't want to say placebo effect,
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.320]   but the sort of belief effects
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.960]   that are woven in with a score.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.720]   So it seems to me that combining subjective
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.800]   and objective data is probably best.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.200]   - And I do believe that you should trust your own physiology
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.720]   and the way that your body is telling you to feel,
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.160]   because in fact, it used to be that people with insomnia
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.000]   were often not believed,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.020]   because you put them in a sleep lab
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.320]   and they look like they slept great,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.520]   and you wake them up in the morning,
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.640]   they say, oh, I didn't sleep very well at all.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.720]   And that's because probably we just came out with a paper
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.640]   that shows that subcortical structures
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.760]   can be in a completely different sleep state
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.880]   than cortical structures,
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.640]   which is what we measure in the sleep lab,
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.480]   what the cortex is doing.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.520]   So it might be that people who say,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.200]   I did not sleep all night long,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.760]   even though the cortex is saying,
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.600]   oh no, you had great sleep,
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.080]   was because they're monitoring their subcortical,
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.480]   hypothalamus, hippocampus, thalamus.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.400]   Other structures that the sleep lab just can't access
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.080]   unless you have depth electrodes,
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:30.600]   which nobody really wants.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.400]   - Right, because that requires holes in the skull and wires.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.160]   Wow, so does that mean that the last 50 plus years
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.520]   of sleep science, it's potentially flawed in some way
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.580]   because they're only recording from,
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.120]   I guess this would be the analogy would be,
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.320]   it's like recording from the surface of the ocean
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.160]   as opposed to the depth of the ocean.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:54.280]   - Right, and trying to ascertain the life moving down deep
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.120]   and the depth of the ocean.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.760]   - Brace yourselves colleagues
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.600]   at Stanford Sleep Lab and elsewhere,
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.560]   but please just tell us,
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.160]   'cause I think scientists want to know the truth.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.000]   - Yeah, I mean, it's not for nothing
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.520]   that you want to know what the cortex is doing.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.160]   I mean, the cortex is really important for a lot of things,
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.060]   but it doesn't necessarily tell you
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.800]   what a lot of other really important parts of the brain
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.040]   are doing in terms of sleep.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   And, but there's hope because in fact, it would be great.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.760]   I think that's possible from the paper.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.600]   If you look at it, it's in PNAS this year,
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   that you could detect subtle changes in the cortical EEG
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.360]   that might be able to tell you
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.040]   what the subcortical structures are doing.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.420]   Things like the absolute power in that sleep spindle band,
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.040]   that sigma band would change if the hippocampus
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.320]   is in REM sleep and cortex is in that sleep spindle state
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.920]   and vice versa.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.780]   So there is some hope that we can gain
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.920]   from people with depth electrodes
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.200]   or animals with depth electrodes
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.700]   that we could backwards machine learn
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.860]   what the cortex might be able to tell us
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.560]   about subcortical structures from the cortical EEG, so.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.640]   - Interesting, this is going to be a stimulant.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   Yeah, stay tuned.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.600]   This is going to be a stimulus
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.120]   for development of new technology,
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.100]   which is always going to assist in scientific discovery.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.000]   There's one more thing I wanted to ask about
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.420]   the architecture of the night's sleep
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.420]   in terms of early part of the night.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.120]   Earlier, you mentioned the washout of debris
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.680]   and the so-called glymphatic system,
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.840]   I think is what you're referring to.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.240]   Could you tell us a little bit more about the washout
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.920]   that occurs in the brain during sleep,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.840]   what that is and what roles it's thought to serve,
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.080]   and perhaps if there are any ways to ensure
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.760]   that it happens or to ensure that it doesn't happen,
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.280]   and obviously we want this to happen.
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.000]   All right, great question.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.800]   We talked about the circadian clock
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.200]   and how certain things happen at certain times.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.420]   Well, one of the things that happens when we're awake
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:01.320]   and talking to each other is that
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.000]   there's a lot of plasticity.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.320]   There's something that I'm learning from you today
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.060]   and you're learning from me, and that changes our synapses
[00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.200]   and it changes the way our proteins are going to be folded
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.480]   and changed during sleep.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.340]   It unfolds.
[00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.920]   This process actually uses a lot of ATP,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.980]   the power structure, the fuel of the brain,
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.060]   and it unfolds also proteins while we're doing this,
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:29.660]   while we're using them.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.380]   And so during that first part of the night,
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.480]   when we first fall asleep in the first 20 minutes or so,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:39.600]   we're building that adenosine back into ATP,
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.920]   and that's probably why power knobs are called power knobs
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.000]   because we're actually rebuilding the power.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.160]   And then we're also cleaning out
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.120]   through the deep slow waves of slow wave sleep,
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.840]   we're cleaning out all those misfolded proteins,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.440]   unfolded proteins, and other things that get broken down
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   and need to be rebuilt when we're asleep
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.720]   because of its use during wakefulness.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.740]   So I liken that to having a big party during wakefulness
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.840]   and you need all those party goers to leave
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.160]   in order to do the cleanup.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.400]   And so what I think the mechanism is,
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.100]   and this is still something to be tested,
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.520]   is actually slow waves themselves,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.540]   which is bad news for us as we get older
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.460]   and those slow waves get smaller
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.680]   and slow asleep goes away.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.160]   So what happens when a neuron is firing
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.000]   is that it expands, the membrane expands a little bit,
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.400]   it becomes more translucent.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.200]   That's how we know, one of the ways we know
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.740]   that neurons expand when they fire.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.540]   And so every action potential,
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.420]   the membrane expands a little bit
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   as sodium brings water into their cell.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.340]   And then when they're silent, they contract.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.420]   And so during slow waves, the cool thing is that
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.020]   the reason why you can measure them
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.340]   is that all the neurons at the same time,
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.860]   not all of them, but a good portion of them,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.600]   are firing at the same time and silent at the same time.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.380]   And so you think about that as contracting
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.740]   and expanding all at the same time,
[00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.900]   it's kind of like a bilge pump of the brain.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.460]   So that can pump out,
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.560]   glia are also really important for this
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.320]   in terms of cleaning up debris
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.800]   and transferring it to where it needs to go.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.540]   So I think of it actually as a bilge pump,
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.100]   cleaning out our brain.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.060]   - Interesting, I've heard about the glymphatic system
[00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:30.260]   and the glymphatic washout.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.340]   I've never thought about the mechanical aspects of it before.
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.920]   I always thought that for some reason,
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.140]   that now it's obvious to me
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.380]   there had to be something mechanical,
[00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.020]   but only now that you've educated me about this.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.060]   I thought that for some reason,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.060]   the cerebral spinal fluid just starts washing through,
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.660]   but here you're talking about literally an expansion
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.220]   and a contraction of the neurons in unison
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.620]   and pushing the fluid through,
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.540]   cleaning out any misfolded proteins
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.580]   or debris that might occur
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.060]   on the basis of these metabolic pathways.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.980]   And the consequence of that is to what?
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.900]   To leave the brain in a state of
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:09.900]   more pristine action for the next day, is that right?
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.940]   - Yeah, you think of it again like a party.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.860]   And if you don't clean up after that party
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.940]   and you try and hold another one the next day,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.320]   it's going to get more clogged.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.140]   People have a harder time moving around
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:22.780]   and enjoying themselves.
[00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.740]   And if that builds up day after day,
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.380]   it's going to be cognition
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.900]   that would be the party goers moving around becomes hard.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.260]   - And so this bilge pump that you described
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:40.880]   is associated with the big slow waves of deep,
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.300]   well, of slow wave sleep.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.640]   So this is going to occur more or less
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.740]   in the first third of the night, is that right?
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.660]   - That's right.
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:51.060]   - And are there things that inhibit this process
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.940]   and are there things that facilitate this process?
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   - Yeah, so, well, one thing to inhibit is not to get it.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.660]   But--
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.780]   - Right, and here too, sorry to interrupt,
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.020]   but, and is this similar to the case with growth hormone
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:09.140]   where if you go to sleep later than you would normally,
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.380]   you miss the washout.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.220]   - You just miss it, yeah.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.140]   - It's not, you don't delay it, you miss the washout.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.140]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.240]   So if you go to sleep at one or two in the morning,
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.860]   your sleep is still going to be dominated
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.260]   by N2 and REM sleep, not by slow wave sleep.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.140]   So you need to get that first bit of sleep.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.300]   - Would a caveat be if somebody normally goes to sleep
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.580]   at one or two a.m. and wakes up at 10 a.m.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.300]   If that's their normal sleep cycle.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.860]   - Yeah, that should be okay.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.260]   It should be okay.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.340]   You would probably want to do,
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.200]   somebody would want to do a sleep study
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.700]   with people who do that normally
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.500]   and see if also the melatonin release is later
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.940]   and the corticosterone rise that happens normally
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.180]   in the morning also happens later.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.060]   So if everything shifted, good.
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.900]   - Okay, yeah, there are a few studies I've come across
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.400]   that really do argue for the fact
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.760]   that waking up circa sunrise, that doesn't mean at sunrise,
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.500]   but within an hour or two, maybe three hours of sunrise
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   and going to sleep within four hours after sunset or so
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:20.860]   is actually better for the health of all human beings
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:21.960]   than is being a night owl.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.020]   And the night owl, there's almost like a night owl posse
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.720]   out there, especially on social media.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.720]   They get very upset when you say
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.420]   that you should see morning sunlight,
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.640]   that after 10 a.m. you kind of miss the boat.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.940]   They get very upset because I think there are about 20
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.080]   or 30% of people perhaps who really feel
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.980]   like they function better staying up late
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.900]   and waking up late and they function much less well
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.700]   waking up early and going to bed early.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.640]   But the data on health metrics suggests
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.480]   that sorry night owls, that they are wrong.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.380]   - Yeah, sorry me 'cause I'm a night owl.
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.260]   - Oh boy, okay.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.720]   - Well then I'm apologizing directly.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.160]   And here, I'm not a really early morning person.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   I'm kind of more typical.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.680]   If I wake up naturally around 6.30,
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.600]   somewhere between 6.30 and 7.30 a.m.,
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.500]   go to sleep somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.580]   These are averages.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.680]   But I do notice that when I force myself
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   to get up a little earlier and go to sleep a little earlier,
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:22.200]   that my mood and alertness and just overall productivity
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.360]   is much higher.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.600]   And there could be other variables there too.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.520]   - Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.620]   I'm a night owl.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.300]   I love staying up late at night,
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.180]   doing, you know, writing grants, writing papers,
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.140]   watching movies, whatever it is, I love it.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.560]   But I like you and like every human being on earth,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:42.120]   do better if I go to bed earlier and wake up earlier.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.840]   So one good thing for night owls is to have a child.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.760]   Because they will wake you up.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   Their circadian rhythms are so strong.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.600]   They will wake up.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.200]   And even if you deprive them of sleep
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.960]   in the first half of the night,
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.040]   they will still wake up like clockwork
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.960]   because their circadian rhythms are so strong at 6 a.m.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   And so what you've,
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.280]   you haven't done anything good for your kid.
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.160]   You haven't moved their cycle to later
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.700]   and be more in line with yours.
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.440]   In fact, you've just sleep deprived them
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.520]   and made them miss a window
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.000]   and made them cranky the next day
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.440]   and made your life more miserable.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.660]   So go to bed soon after your kids go to bed
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.520]   and wake up with them.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.640]   That's the way to do it.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:18.960]   - Great, the child alarm clock.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.320]   Another reason to have children.
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.280]   - Yes.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.720]   - I got a dog, a puppy, and then that became a dog
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.640]   specifically, well, for many reasons.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.120]   But one reason was I wanted to be one of those
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.240]   early morning, 5.30 a.m. every morning.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.680]   But I ended up getting a bulldog
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.880]   that would literally sleep 16 hours if he could.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.080]   A nuclear bomb could go off and he wouldn't wake up.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:42.000]   But what I started to learn was that
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.200]   bulldogs actually have sleep apnea.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.720]   As far as I know, they're the only species
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.160]   that has a genetically,
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.480]   they're essentially an inbred sleep defect.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.880]   And so I actually don't encourage people to get bulldogs
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.380]   because it's kind of a cruel breed.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.880]   They suffer a lot in that body that they're born into.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.020]   Anyway, a dog can accomplish some of this,
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:06.320]   but get the breed of dog that is going to wake up early.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.280]   So in other words, don't get a bulldog or a mastiff.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.920]   - Well, interestingly, all predatory animals
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:15.640]   like dogs and cats and lions and us,
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   well, more dogs, cats, and lions than us
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.120]   will can sleep, you know, 16 hours a day.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.560]   Ferrets are predatory.
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.520]   They can sleep. - I had a pet ferret.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.920]   And sadly, I also used to work on ferrets,
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:31.280]   publish a number of papers, delightful animals.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.400]   - Yeah, and great because you can study development.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.840]   It's really cool because they're born very altricial
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.760]   like we are with brains that are not very well developed.
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.640]   And so you can see what happens through development
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   and how important these different phases of development
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:47.800]   really are.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   But yes, yeah, maybe we're not as much predators as we think
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.720]   because in fact, our sleep is somewhere between the prey
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.820]   and the predators in terms of the amount of sleep
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.800]   that we usually need at night.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.160]   But those predators can sleep 16 hours napping all day long
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.920]   and they're more crepuscular perhaps like their prey are.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.760]   - So dawn and dusk active?
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.620]   - Yeah, dawn and dusk active.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:20.080]   Yeah, but anyway, yes, children and dogs.
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:21.960]   Actually, there was a poll done
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.920]   by the National Sleep Foundation
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.360]   to see what the number one thing is
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.800]   that wakes people up at night.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.640]   And number two is going to the bathroom.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.820]   Number three is children because, you know,
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:33.660]   when your children are young,
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.080]   but that only lasts a few years
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.160]   that they'll wake you up when they're babies.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.120]   But the number one thing is pets
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.000]   and pets needing to go out or cats wanting to curl up
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.980]   with you or whatever it is,
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.220]   pets needs will wake you up more in the middle of the night
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.440]   than anything else.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.360]   - Another reason to not get a nocturnal pet.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.920]   People who get hamsters pretty quickly realize
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.000]   that they are nocturnal
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.440]   and they want to run on their wheel and around.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.680]   - Yeah, you got to put them in the living room
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.040]   away from where you sleep.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.320]   - I vote fish tank, folks.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.520]   Freshwater fish tank.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.240]   There are all sorts of reasons to not get a saltwater tank.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.520]   Freshwater fish tank or a child.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.820]   - I appreciate that vote.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:12.380]   And I appreciate you mentioning ferrets.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.100]   And by the way, folks, they are carnivores.
[00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:15.060]   They are not rodents.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.560]   And they have very elaborate brain structures.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.780]   They're very smart.
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:22.680]   In the same family as the honey badgers
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.800]   and the other mustelids.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.160]   Anyway, I shouldn't geek out too much on the mustelids
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.600]   or else I'll take the remainder of all our time.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.200]   I'd love for you to tell us about REM sleep
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.780]   and the sleep later in the night
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.240]   as it relates to dreams and emotionality.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.740]   And this is probably the appropriate time
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.380]   for you to introduce us to this incredible structure
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.640]   in the brain, which is the locus coeruleus.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.220]   A difficult structure to spell,
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.280]   but a beautifully named structure.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.200]   I find locus coeruleus to be just fascinating.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.520]   And I know a small fraction of what it does
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:02.220]   and I'm hoping you're going to educate me and our audience
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.120]   about more about what it does.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.400]   And hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.280]   to epinephrine, AKA adrenaline.
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.880]   - Yeah, I'm so glad you brought this up
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.480]   because I can totally geek out on the locus coeruleus.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.320]   - Please do.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.560]   - Locus meaning spot or place and coeruleus meaning blue.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.640]   So you could just call it the blue spot.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:21.460]   That's the easiest.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:25.280]   Every animal with a brain has a blue spot.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.340]   And yeah, and I mean every other animal with a brain
[00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.980]   because of course there are animals with nervous systems
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.100]   that are not centralized like jellyfish.
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.140]   But anyway, we're digressing there.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.820]   So the locus coeruleus is filled with neurons
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.660]   that have in them norepinephrine,
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.260]   which is the brain's version of epinephrine or adrenaline.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:49.100]   It's also called noradrenaline.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.860]   And what it does is it,
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.680]   just like adrenaline in the rest of our bodies,
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   it helps prime us to respond to our environment.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.520]   So when locus coeruleus neurons fire and fire in a burst,
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.800]   we can switch our attention and they will fire in a burst
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.280]   if, for example, a loud noise happens
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.400]   in the middle of your concentrating on something.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.560]   So you can, it helps, it fires,
[00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.880]   and it helps you switch your attention to that thing
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.560]   and then learn quickly from it.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.080]   So it's really important in a stress response.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.320]   It helps us do quick one-trial learning.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.600]   And then a tonic activity during the day
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.200]   when you're just doing normal,
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   going about your normal concentration kind of activities
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:34.880]   is really good for sustained attention.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.200]   It works with the cholinergic system of our basal forebrain,
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.640]   which is really important for learning and memory also
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.220]   to help us learn about things and put things together.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:50.160]   But just tonic levels are signature
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.320]   of wakefulness and alertness.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.440]   So too much is panic with a locus coeruleus activity.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.120]   A burst is switching attention,
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:03.200]   and then tonic levels are sustained constant attention.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.440]   And then when we go to sleep, the locus coeruleus slows
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.400]   and goes from about, on average, two hertz
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   to about one hertz, one cycle per second tonically.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.000]   And then when we go into REM sleep,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.360]   it's the only time when it shuts off completely.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.180]   And it appears that that complete silence
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:26.240]   is really, really important for a number of things.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:29.420]   And the main thing that I think it's important for
[00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:33.880]   is the ability to erase and break down synapses
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:35.320]   that are no longer working for us.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.400]   So they encode things that are false now,
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.440]   or they are encoding things that we learned
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.760]   in the novelty encoding pathway of our brain
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.520]   that have now been consolidated to other pathways.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.000]   And so we need to now erase them
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.640]   from the novelty encoding pathway.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.680]   And that is really, really important
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.000]   for being able to continue to learn things all of our lives.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.200]   So like erasing that REM, or that,
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:03.840]   I don't know, what do you call those disks
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.880]   that you stick into computers?
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.880]   - Hard drive, no, thumb drives.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.240]   - Thumb drives, yeah, erasing your thumb drives.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.200]   That thumb drive is what you carry around all day long.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.080]   And then during sleep, you write that thumb drive
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.560]   to the cortex, to the long-term memory structures,
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.800]   and you need to refresh that thumb drive.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.860]   And that's what happens during REM sleep
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.040]   when the locus coeruleus is off,
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.800]   because whenever it's on and neuroadrenaline is there,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.880]   it helps us to put things together.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.040]   It helps us to learn and strengthen synapses,
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.620]   but it does not allow us to actually weaken synapses
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.520]   that are also a really important part
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.340]   for life, a important part of lifelong learning.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.000]   Yeah, there's so much more I could say about that.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.240]   - Yeah, locus coeruleus sounds fascinating.
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.280]   So it's connected to the basal forebrain cholinergic system.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:52.840]   The neurons in locus coeruleus, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   release norepinephrine, perhaps epinephrine as well?
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:01.280]   - Well, no, the brain's version of epinephrine
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.600]   is norepinephrine.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.760]   The other thing it also,
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.560]   the precursor to norepinephrine is dopamine.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.160]   And so the source of dopamine in the hippocampus
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.560]   seems to be the locus coeruleus,
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.600]   and it's still a mystery as under what conditions
[00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.880]   the locus coeruleus also releases dopamine,
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.200]   but it's really important when we're learning something new
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.960]   to also release dopamine or to at least activate
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.640]   the dopaminergic receptors in our hippocampus.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.880]   So yeah, so dopamine, norepinephrine,
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:33.320]   and then there's also galanin,
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.680]   which is important for releasing when we're stressed,
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.160]   and it helps also without rapid learning.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.400]   It works in concert with norepinephrine
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.360]   and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.560]   so that we learn really quickly.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:52.120]   - I love that there are multiple molecules involved
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.680]   because that signals us to a principle,
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.020]   which is that even if people can't remember all the names,
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:02.440]   that rarely in biology is something handled
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.040]   by just one molecule or pathway,
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:06.160]   that redundancy is the rule
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.280]   because signaling attention to specific events
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.320]   is so important.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.080]   So I'm going to use that as a just so story.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.120]   I always say, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.120]   but it makes sense to me as to why redundancy
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.960]   would exist in the system.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:20.800]   - Absolutely.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.600]   And in fact, when we form hypotheses about the brain,
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.860]   we're always wrong.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.240]   And the reason why we're always wrong
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.080]   is because it's more complicated than we'd like to think.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.720]   And because in our brains, when we're forming hypotheses,
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.900]   it's we fail to account for all of the factors
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.920]   that are involved, the glia, the neuropeptides,
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.960]   the neurotransmitters, the physical structure of synapses.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.600]   And so when I was going through grad school 35 years ago,
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.640]   we, the dogma was that every neuron
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:51.960]   contains one neurotransmitter
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.320]   and releases one neurotransmitter.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.160]   And you had excitatory neurotransmitters
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.640]   and inhibitory neurotransmitters
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   and neuromodulatory neurotransmitters,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.440]   but that's as complicated as it's got.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.060]   And then we started talking about neuropeptides
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.040]   and people said, oh no, please don't complicate it.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.920]   And then we started talking about how neurons
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.200]   contain both neuropeptides and neurotransmitters
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.480]   and maybe more than one neurotransmitter.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.720]   - And maybe even hormones too.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.320]   - Hormones and oh Lord, it's just so complicated,
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.080]   but I gotta admit that's why it works, right?
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.240]   And every time the brain teaches us something new
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.400]   about itself that we didn't hypothesize,
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.840]   we say, oh, of course that wouldn't work
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.320]   if the way I hypothesized it with it.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.720]   We actually need redundancy.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.380]   We need all of these systems to work together.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.120]   - Yeah, it's daunting sometimes,
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.120]   but it also ensures many careers in science
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.800]   and neuroscience in particular.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.600]   So note that aspiring scientists,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.280]   there's plenty of room for discovery.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   - Do you want me to talk about norepinephrine
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.760]   and emotion and stress?
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.920]   - Yes, well, what I'd love for you to tell us about
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:57.680]   is what role this lack of norepinephrine release
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.040]   during rapid eye movement sleep is thought to achieve.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.160]   And maybe you could also review some of your work
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.920]   describing conditions under which norepinephrine invades.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.200]   - Yeah, invades sleep.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.720]   - Rapid eye movement sleep and other patterns of sleep
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.040]   and how that can be detrimental.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.520]   - Yeah, so a lot of this is hypothetical,
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   but based on a lot of good evidence
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.640]   that we're sewing together into a schema
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.200]   from which these hypotheses come,
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.580]   so a model schema from which the hypotheses come.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.680]   But one thing that happens to people
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.060]   with post-traumatic stress disorder
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.400]   is that there is a lot of evidence
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.060]   that the locus surrealis doesn't stop firing in REM sleep.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.580]   So whereas their levels of norepinephrine
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:44.180]   might be similar to people without PTSD during the day
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.960]   and even during the first part of the night,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.940]   during the wee hours of the morning
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.140]   and when you measure norepinephrine levels
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:55.460]   from metabolites in the blood or the cerebral spinal fluid,
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.380]   you see that people with PTSD,
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.020]   it's during the wee hours of the morning
[01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:00.180]   when you have the most REM sleep
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.700]   that their norepinephrine levels differentiate most
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.180]   from those that don't have PTSD.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.560]   And so that's evidence that the locus surrealis
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.740]   is not shutting down during REM sleep like it should.
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.940]   Other evidence is heart rate variability.
[01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.360]   When our locus surrealis is firing,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.600]   our heart rates are generally a little higher
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.140]   and they don't vary as much as they do
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.220]   when the locus surrealis is not firing.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.580]   So during slow wave sleep,
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.380]   normally we have this big juicy variability in heart rate
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.220]   with every breath in and breath out
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.500]   because our noradrenergic levels, our norepinephrine levels
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.520]   are lower during REM sleep that goes away entirely
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.540]   and our heart rate is dominated by parasympathetic
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:46.980]   rather than sympathetic activity
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.060]   and also what our brain is driving,
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.260]   what we're dreaming about.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.380]   For example, if we're dreaming,
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.300]   we're running, our heart rates will go up.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.660]   But norepinephrine levels still should be low or off.
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.580]   So people with PTSD that noradrenergics,
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.420]   we're studying these in rats too,
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.960]   is it true that our locus surrealis doesn't shut off
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.320]   when we have post-traumatic stress disorder
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.420]   and the preliminary evidence is yes,
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.380]   it's true that it doesn't shut off.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.340]   So what that would do is norepinephrine would act
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:21.380]   at synapses to prevent that weakening that you really need,
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.860]   for example, of novelty encoding structures.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.900]   And it keeps memories in that novelty encoding structure
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.980]   even once it's consolidated to the rest of the brain.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.180]   So in the hippocampus, which is important
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.400]   for remembering things throughout our lives
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.720]   and it's that thumb drive,
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.820]   we need it to be erased so that we can learn new things
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:50.100]   once it's been consolidated to the hard drive of our cortex.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.820]   And so if we're not able to do that,
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.180]   we fill up that REM really quickly
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:57.620]   or that thumb drive really quickly
[01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.820]   and we're not able to learn new things.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.940]   So for example, after a trauma,
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.260]   I talked to all the locus surrealists
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.300]   responding in stressful situations.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.100]   That's great, it's very adaptive,
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.420]   but then you need it to stop.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.700]   Once you've learned what you need to learn from it
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.820]   and you wanna go to sleep,
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.860]   you need the locus surrealist to calm down
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.660]   and during REM sleep, you want it to stop
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.940]   because then when you've consolidated
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.460]   that traumatic memory to the cortex,
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.420]   you need to erase it from the novelty encoding structures.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.020]   For example, in the hippocampus.
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.600]   So that then when you're in the context of safety,
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.100]   you can learn those new things, those new contexts
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:35.100]   and stop responding to those same stimuli
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:38.220]   as though you're in that original situation.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.760]   So if you're not able to erase that thumb drive,
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.300]   you will always feel like that trauma happened
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:48.340]   that same day, like earlier that same day
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.340]   and respond as you would to an early, a recent trauma,
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.660]   which is with beating heart and all of that.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:00.960]   So even memories that are years past,
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.180]   if you're never able to downscale that novelty
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.100]   encoding structure and you purge it
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.380]   from that traumatic memory, it will stay fresh and new
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.480]   and then become maladaptive.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.060]   - I'd like to just take a brief moment
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.880]   and thank one of our podcast sponsors,
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.120]   which is InsideTracker.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.800]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.380]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.940]   to help you better understand your body
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.820]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:29.100]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.080]   for the simple reason that blood work is the only way
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.420]   that you can monitor the markers, such as hormone markers,
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.560]   lipids, metabolic factors, et cetera,
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.280]   that impact your immediate and long-term health.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.400]   One major challenge with blood work, however,
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.000]   is that most of the time it does not come back
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.620]   with any information about what to do
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.860]   in order to move the values for hormones,
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.740]   metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.160]   into the ranges that you want.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.620]   With InsideTracker, changing those values
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.780]   becomes very straightforward
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.720]   because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:00.760]   to address the nutrition-based, behavior-based,
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.500]   supplement-based approaches that you can use
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.640]   in order to move those values into the ranges
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.540]   that are optimal for you, your vitality,
[01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:08.660]   and your longevity.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.400]   InsideTracker now includes a measurement
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.060]   of apolipoprotein B, so-called ApoB in their ultimate plan.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.720]   ApoB is a key marker of cardiovascular health,
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.460]   and therefore there's extreme value
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:20.480]   to knowing your ApoB levels.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.880]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.600]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.920]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.560]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.920]   - What approaches are you aware of
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.200]   that can turn down the output of locus coeruleus
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.520]   during these phases of sleep?
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.180]   And for that matter, what things can cause ramping up
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.480]   of locus coeruleus during this phase of sleep?
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:50.500]   We've had a couple of podcast episodes, solo episodes,
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.060]   and with guests talking about trauma.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:54.500]   We had Dr. Paul Conte, who's a Stanford-trained,
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.540]   Harvard-trained psychiatrist who talked a lot about trauma,
[01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.900]   wrote an excellent book on trauma.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:03.580]   And certainly sleep was emphasized as a key thing,
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.480]   like get enough sleep.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.220]   But here you're saying even if somebody with trauma
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.340]   gets enough sleep,
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.420]   if locus coeruleus is hyperactive during sleep,
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.580]   those traumas are going to persist.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.640]   And most of the trauma treatments that I'm aware of
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:16.940]   are everything ranging from cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:19.740]   talk therapy, drug therapy, EMDR, hypnosis.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.860]   Nowadays, there's a lot of interest and attention
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:26.880]   on clinical studies on exploring psychedelics,
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.180]   high-dose psilocybin, and MDMA.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:32.580]   So it's a vast landscape, none of which, as far as I know,
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.740]   is really focused on sleep specifically.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:35.580]   - No, they're not.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.860]   And they should be,
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.460]   because actually psychedelics is a sleep-like state,
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:42.540]   and it's a REM sleep-like state.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.140]   Although, of course, there are some major differences.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:49.100]   So yeah, so much to talk about here.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.620]   So antidepressants are often
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.740]   neurodenergic or serotonergic reuptake inhibitors.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.200]   So they leave norepinephrine, actually,
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.580]   out there in the synapses.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:03.200]   And what that does is it inhibits REM sleep.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.900]   And if you're able to get REM sleep,
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.020]   it would probably be REM sleep with some
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.100]   neurodenergic activity.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.360]   So actually, I think, anyway, I'm not a physician,
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.580]   that antidepressants are counter-indicated.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.100]   You don't want to take them if you've experienced a trauma
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.040]   and you're experiencing PTSD, because if anything,
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.260]   it's going to make it worse or at least prevent
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:26.020]   the type of adaptive REM sleep that you really need
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.480]   in order to resolve those emotions and move on.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:32.840]   - Is that statement specific to antidepressants
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.160]   that tickle the noradrenergic pathway?
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.760]   So the one that comes to mind is brupipryon,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.820]   which is, I think the brand name is Wellbutrin.
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:46.060]   It's a dopaminergic and noradrenergic agonist.
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.300]   So that's the net effect, as opposed to the
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.940]   Prozaxoloft variety, which are SSRIs.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:55.720]   - Yes, yes, but SSRIs themselves also are problematic
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.120]   because we didn't talk about it yet,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.540]   but the dorsal raphe nucleus, which produces serotonin,
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:05.160]   which the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.660]   block from being reuptaken,
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.140]   leaves too much serotonin out there.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.660]   And what serotonin also is another neuro-drenergic,
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.760]   I'm sorry, another neurotransmitter
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.240]   that's down-regulated during REM sleep,
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.560]   that's specifically off during REM sleep.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.560]   And what serotonin does is it weights all of our cognition
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.240]   to being able to recognize novelty again.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.800]   So it sort of weights our brain away
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.320]   from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.720]   And it might be one reason why
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.480]   it's an effective antidepressant,
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.720]   because it makes the world feel fresh and new again, right?
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.880]   But when you have too much,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.960]   you're holding a novel traumatic memory
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.200]   in your novelty encoding structure too strongly already,
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.280]   you don't want to, again, weight things toward novelty.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.000]   You need that absence of serotonin also
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.040]   to help you get that sense of familiarity
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   and to start erasing the novelty encoding structures.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.720]   So you need both to be absent.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.240]   - It's really interesting.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.040]   We hear a lot about serotonin
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.520]   and it's not often discussed
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.380]   in terms of its features related to novelty enough, I think.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.320]   And what you just described,
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.140]   and accuse me to something that Dr. Paul Conte and others
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.720]   have said in terms of trauma,
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.980]   and here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.400]   so my apologies to them for not getting this exactly right,
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.040]   that an effective treatment for trauma
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.240]   does not erase the traumatic memory,
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.520]   but it causes a transition
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.520]   of what once was disturbing and invasive and maladaptive
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.720]   to eventually just become kind of a boring old story
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.040]   that has kind of a fuzzy texture to it,
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.060]   as opposed to this kind of sharp, high friction texture
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.040]   that invades our thinking
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.600]   and obviously our sleeping states as well.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.500]   So again, and I appreciate the disclaimer,
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.260]   the caveats around not being a clinician, et cetera,
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:10.060]   but I do think that there's a lot of interest now
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.840]   in whether or not antidepressants
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.260]   are effective for trauma or not.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.380]   And I think these aspects of neuromodulation
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.800]   as they relate to, let's call it erasing traumas
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.140]   or changing the emotional load of traumas during sleep
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:24.480]   is something important to take note.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.640]   We also have a lot of clinicians that listen to this podcast,
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.400]   so they should also take note, please.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.400]   So if I want to reduce the amount of norepinephrine
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.640]   released from locus coeruleus
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.880]   during rapid eye movement sleep
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.680]   to eliminate the troubling or maybe even traumatic memories
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.580]   and allow late stages of sleep each night
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.660]   to have their maximum positive effect,
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:55.080]   is there anything that I can do besides avoiding traumas,
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.600]   avoiding serotonergic or noradrenergic compounds?
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.840]   - Well, I would also avoid anything
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:02.160]   just prior to going to sleep
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.560]   that might excite those systems.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.760]   So a lot of novelty, a lot of exciting,
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.720]   stress-inducing video games.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   Try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.080]   So maybe deep breathing exercises.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.860]   That's a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.280]   fight or flight system, this deep breathing.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.420]   And we haven't been able to test this with rats
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:32.420]   because we can't ask them to do a deep breathing exercise.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.620]   (laughs)
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:35.140]   There might be a way we can do that,
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.560]   but I haven't found out or figured it out yet.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.680]   But if there's a way you can make your sympathetic system,
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.760]   nervous system calm down before you go to sleep,
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.480]   might free for you meditation
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.960]   or deep breathing exercises might be for some,
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.560]   a warm bath or a comforting book.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:57.560]   Nothing too exciting, but also nothing too boring perhaps.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.300]   Just something right in the middle
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:03.300]   which makes you feel happy and calm is what you should do.
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:06.600]   And if you instead go to sleep while you're anxious
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   or you're hyped up, then your sleep could become maladaptive.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.020]   Another thing that happens in rats
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.380]   that we have yet to know if it happens in women
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   is that female rats have three phases of their estrous cycle
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.520]   that their locus realus doesn't seem to calm down
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.820]   during REM sleep as much.
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:32.120]   And we don't know why, but during the high estrogen phases
[01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.060]   of their estrous cycle, the locus realus shuts down
[01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.440]   just like it does in male rats.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.780]   But in the other three phases, it doesn't.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.780]   So one thing that might work, and in fact,
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.620]   there are a few studies that show it,
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:50.620]   it could work really well is giving women
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:55.340]   after a trauma event something that contains estrogen
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.540]   because estrogen somehow is protective against PTSD.
[01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:02.420]   And they know that through a retrospective studies
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:05.260]   where they gave women an emergency room,
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.620]   either a pill with estrogen or without,
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.980]   and those that had a pill with estrogen in it
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.940]   were much less likely to get PTSD from that trauma
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:14.580]   as measured a year later than those
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:15.900]   that had the pill without.
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:20.900]   So there's some really good studies by Bronwyn Graham.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:24.380]   She's out of Australia to really hone in
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.460]   on how much estrogen do you need.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.820]   And also testosterone, just so you know,
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.920]   gets converted to estrogen in the brain.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.300]   So testosterone also can be protective
[01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.740]   because it gets converted to estrogen.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.100]   But there's something about estrogen
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.120]   that's really helpful and protective
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.880]   from the high locus realus firing.
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.580]   And this is again, preliminary data
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.780]   that we don't have full, we don't have all the answers yet,
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:52.280]   and we are looking into it actively right now,
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.680]   but it's really important.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.760]   The other thing about women is that we are
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.780]   two to four times more susceptible
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.440]   to anxiety-related mental health disorders,
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.780]   including post-traumatic stress disorder.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:05.280]   So if we could figure out what's happening
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.440]   to the locus realus during sleep in women,
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:12.340]   and then figure out a way to normalize that
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:14.920]   so the locus realus is silent when it needs to be silent,
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.300]   I think we could go a long way in helping women
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:22.720]   be more resilient to stress-related disorders.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.160]   - What are some other sex differences
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:26.580]   as they relate to sleep?
[01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:29.140]   - Yeah, yeah, that's a really good question.
[01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:33.960]   There have been very few studies, unfortunately,
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.880]   of women in sleep, women in estrous cycle
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:39.760]   or menstrual cycle in sleep.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.640]   And, but what we have found,
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.680]   which actually largely replicated the study in 1960,
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.460]   is that women or females rather at high estrogen,
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:55.480]   high hormonal phases of their estrous cycle
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.340]   or menstrual cycle sleep a lot less,
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.380]   but that sleep is more efficient.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:04.220]   So that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles,
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.880]   which I haven't gone into what they might do
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.480]   except this connection between the hippocampus and cortex,
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.320]   but those sleep spindles are more dense
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.100]   and more coherent across the brain areas.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.160]   The theta cycle, which is five to 10 hertz
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.760]   in the hippocampus, important for one year learning
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.500]   and also important during REM sleep,
[01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.960]   is also bigger and juicier during the high hormonal phases.
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:27.480]   So even though there's less sleep,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.160]   it's more efficient and better.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:35.240]   But, so all of that efficiency seems to be reduced
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.300]   in those other hormonal phases.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.060]   So even though you might sleep a little more,
[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:44.620]   you might need more sleep, in fact,
[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   in order to accomplish the same thing that you can get
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.620]   with that short, very efficient sleep of high hormonal phases.
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.460]   - Very interesting.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:57.420]   I think there is a growing trend,
[01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:02.420]   at least among NIH funded grants to require that,
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.100]   as they refer to it in the grants,
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.060]   a biological sex as a variable.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:10.340]   And here we're talking about sex, the verb,
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.020]   although I'm sure there's studies about that too,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.460]   but biological sex is a variable
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.060]   because there is a dearth of studies exploring
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.620]   sex differences in most everything.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.260]   There are all sorts of reasons for that,
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:24.700]   but more importantly, fortunately, the trend is shifting.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:29.060]   - Yeah, and even when you study males versus females,
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.820]   a lot of people just include females in their studies,
[01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:35.540]   but then don't track the estrous cycle
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:39.500]   or menstrual cycle, and hormones have huge effects
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.340]   on our behavior.
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.380]   I mean, just think of when you said sex,
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:46.060]   before our hormones come in, we're not interested in it.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:49.940]   And suddenly, that's kind of a main driver of behaviors.
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:53.460]   Hormones can definitely change who we are and what we do.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:56.820]   So we should be studying hormones, not just sex.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.980]   - I always say that puberty is perhaps
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.100]   the most massive transformation and rate of aging
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.100]   that any of us go through in a short amount of time.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:05.940]   An individual, their cognition changes,
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.740]   their worldview changes, and that's largely hormonal-driven,
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:12.100]   and obviously, neural architecture has changed too.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.540]   I'm very happy that you mentioned trying to get
[01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:19.460]   into calmer states prior to sleep and some ways to do that.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.140]   I'm a big fan, and I've talked a lot before
[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:23.700]   on this podcast about things like yoga nidra,
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:26.180]   which is a non-movement-based practice,
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.100]   sometimes called non-sleep deep rest,
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:30.100]   where people actually take some time each day
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.820]   to practice how to go into a more parasympathetic,
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.740]   aka relaxed state, deliberately,
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.420]   because it's a bit of a skill.
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.300]   Yeah, and there's some good data, really,
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.140]   mostly out of a laboratory in Scandinavia,
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.020]   showing huge increases in nigrostriatal dopamine
[01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.700]   when people basically engage in a practice
[01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.740]   of deliberate non-movement,
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:54.500]   and that the brain actually enters states
[01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.580]   of a very shallow sleep, so sort of nap-ish,
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.980]   but the idea is to actually stay awake but motionless,
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.700]   and it does seem to restore a certain number of features
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.100]   of neurochemistry, but perhaps more importantly,
[01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.820]   it teaches people to relax,
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.020]   which is something that most people are not very good at.
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:15.700]   But in any event, and people who listen to this podcast
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.140]   have heard me say this over and over again,
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.340]   so I sound like a broken record,
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.580]   but this practice, as a zero-cost practice
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.900]   that doesn't require any pharmacology,
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.380]   does seem to really enhance people's ability
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:28.340]   to fall asleep more quickly and to fall back asleep
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.700]   if they wake up in the middle of the night.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.820]   So in any event, another plug for NSDR, yoga nidra.
[01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.620]   - Well, I just also want to add to that,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.340]   that's one of the reasons why insomnia is so insidious
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.580]   is because when people feel like they haven't gotten
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:42.100]   enough sleep and they aren't getting enough sleep
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.780]   and they become anxious about getting enough sleep,
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.100]   and then you're anxious before going to sleep,
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:47.060]   like I'm not going to fall asleep,
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.340]   it's going to be 45 minutes in,
[01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.500]   and then that's a positive feedback loop.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.380]   So you need to break that loop, say, okay,
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.540]   my body's going to get as much sleep as it needs,
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.580]   I needn't worry about it,
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:00.020]   and then practice this relaxation to say,
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.700]   hey, it's all okay, it's going to be all right,
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:06.660]   and then concentrate on things that relax you,
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.780]   whether it's concentrating or not concentrating,
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.500]   whatever it is.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.740]   You mentioned yoga nidra,
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:19.860]   and that reminded me of transcendental meditation,
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.420]   which is something that also hasn't been studied well,
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.700]   largely because we can't ask non-human animals to do it.
[01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:28.020]   And so we don't know what's happening
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.300]   with our neurochemistry and our brain activity
[01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.460]   in a deep and meaningful way.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.860]   But one thing that has been shown
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.380]   and those that can do it really well
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:42.420]   is that that theta activity that I said happens
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.780]   when you're learning something or when you're in REM sleep,
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:50.580]   it's well established and increases
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:52.500]   during the transcendental meditation.
[01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.260]   So it might be that some states of meditation
[01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:01.460]   could in some ways replace or mimic some functions of,
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:02.740]   for example, REM sleep.
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:06.100]   But again, we don't know if all the neurochemistry is right
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:08.100]   to do, for example, the thing that I was talking about,
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:11.460]   which is erasing the novelty and coding structures of the brain.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:14.980]   That needs an absence of norepinephrine and serotonin,
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.980]   which we don't know if that goes away
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:19.220]   with transcendental meditation.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.380]   We just don't know the answer to that yet.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.900]   - Yeah, the studies on yoga nidra and sleep replacement
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.860]   are kind of interesting.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.300]   It does seem to be the case that nothing
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.300]   can really replace sleep except sleep,
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.060]   but that if one is sleep deprived
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.820]   or is having trouble falling back asleep,
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:39.220]   that these things like, and I hear it's,
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.540]   I acknowledge this is essentially like yoga nidra,
[01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.100]   but we now call it non-sleep deep breast or NSDR
[01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:47.060]   because oftentimes names like yoga nidra act
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:50.500]   as a kind of a barrier for what would otherwise be people
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:51.780]   willing to try a practice.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.980]   It sounds mystical, it sounds like flying carpets
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.300]   and, you know, it sounds like you have to go to Esalen,
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.220]   by the way, Esalen's a beautiful place,
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:00.420]   but it sounds like you have to go there
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.900]   or live in the West Coast to believe in this stuff,
[01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.100]   but it's simply not the case.
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.020]   These are practices that are really just self-directed
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.020]   relaxation as a practice that allows people to get better
[01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.500]   and better at directing their brain states
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.020]   towards more relaxation.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.620]   And most people have an asymmetry.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:19.780]   Like for instance, most people can force themselves
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.820]   to stay up later, but they have a hard time
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.020]   going to sleep earlier.
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:25.620]   And that just speaks to the asymmetry
[01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:28.100]   that's probably adaptive and survival-based,
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:30.820]   that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.420]   than we can tend to calm ourselves down.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.940]   - Yeah, yeah, and actually, you know,
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.260]   to appeal to other Christians like me,
[01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:40.820]   prayer can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:44.980]   because through prayer, you're giving your cares to God
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.340]   and saying, you know, and then you are relaxed, more relaxed.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:53.540]   And I just want to say that because the same reason
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.220]   that yoga might put some people off,
[01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:59.380]   it might put some people off to talk about prayer,
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.580]   but it's the same process of being able to relax.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.740]   And yeah.
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.420]   - And get outside our own experience a little bit.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:09.540]   - Get outside our own experience, yeah.
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:10.340]   - Yeah.
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:12.740]   - Back out, get a worldview that might actually
[01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.500]   also help us to relax.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:17.860]   - Well, you might be surprised at how many clinicians
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.540]   and scientists who've come on this podcast
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:23.220]   have mentioned things like prayer from various perspectives,
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:26.260]   Christianity, Judaism, Muslim traditions, and others,
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.220]   that as a parallel to all of these things.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.260]   And I think what it speaks to is the fact that ultimately
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.540]   the biological architectures that we're all contending with
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.900]   are going to be identical, right?
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.660]   And so different ways to tap into them
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:42.340]   and ones that are congruent with people's beliefs,
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.500]   I think are great.
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:47.380]   - Yeah, because anything non-congruent with your beliefs
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:48.420]   is also stressful.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.460]   - Right, and feels forced.
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:52.420]   And that's why this idea of calling it non-sleep deep rest
[01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.620]   in addition to yoga nidra was not to detract from the naming
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:57.380]   or the history around yoga nidra,
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.380]   but I was finding that it was a barrier.
[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.380]   Likewise, yoga nidra tends to include things like intentions,
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.140]   whereas NSDR scripts, and by the way,
[01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.700]   we will provide links to some NSDR and yoga nidra scripts,
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.940]   but NSDR has no intentions.
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:12.660]   It's simply a body scan deep relaxation base.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:15.060]   So it's sort of the scientific version of all of this stuff.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.140]   And actually we study it in the laboratory
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.380]   and some of the brain states that people go into,
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.060]   but that's a discussion for another time.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:23.140]   - Well, another thing, this is hard not to,
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:25.380]   my mother used to tell me when I said we could play,
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.180]   I can't go to sleep.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.940]   She'd say, well, you know, start with your toes and relax.
[01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:32.820]   So you would clench your muscles around your toes
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.860]   and you relax them and do that all the way from your toes
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.580]   all the way to your head.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.860]   And I don't know where she got this.
[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.620]   It might've been her own common sense,
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:43.540]   or she might've gotten it from this NPR show.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.460]   It's called "The Mind Can Keep You Well."
[01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.820]   She used to listen to.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.540]   But that's another intentional relaxation
[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.980]   that focuses on the body rather than
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.620]   on your own mental processes, but.
[01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.020]   - I do a little bit of work with the military
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:00.900]   and there's a method within certain communities
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:02.820]   of special operations in the US military,
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.820]   where if they can't sleep
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.580]   or they're having challenges sleeping,
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:10.420]   they will deliberately try and relax their facial muscles
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.460]   in particular, like sort of drape the facial muscles
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.380]   and use long or exhale-emphasized breathing,
[01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.340]   does seem to increase the probability
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.100]   of transitioning back into sleep.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.980]   And those are hallmarks of yoga nidra,
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.460]   non-sleep deep breaths, body scans.
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.140]   And so I think all of these things converge
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:31.460]   on a common theme, you know, as neurobiologists,
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.500]   we can say all of the things that we are describing,
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:37.140]   certainly move the needle away
[01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.900]   from locus coeruleus activation.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:41.220]   And we haven't done the experiment to really look at that,
[01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:43.380]   but it seems all these things are counter
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.820]   to noradrenaline release.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.140]   - Right, another one is yawning.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:50.580]   Yawning in itself is that kind of sort of tensing
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:53.940]   of all the muscles in your face and then relaxing them.
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.860]   So it might be why we yawn.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.140]   We don't know why we yawn yet,
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.260]   but it might also be really great.
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.180]   Actually animals yawn too, you know.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:04.900]   - No, my bulldog was a perpetual,
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:06.420]   if he wasn't sleeping, he was yawning.
[01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.940]   - And it would be interesting to see what yawning does
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:10.820]   to the locus coeruleus.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.940]   Does that also come and switch the locus coeruleus activity?
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:17.140]   Because it's interesting that facial nerve,
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:20.820]   like trigeminal nerve, you know, through the vagus connects
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.700]   indirectly to the locus coeruleus
[01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.220]   and has a powerful effect on that.
[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.700]   - Interesting, a common, I think friend of ours
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.580]   and direct colleague of yours, Jack Feldman was a guest
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.460]   on this podcast telling us about all the amazing structures
[01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.660]   he and others have discovered in respiration and breathing.
[01:27:36.660 --> 01:27:38.500]   Sounds like we have a collaboration brewing
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.060]   that the three of us should definitely carry out.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.940]   I'd love for you to share with us a little bit more
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:46.660]   about the spindles that have come up a few times.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.980]   And I don't know if it's relevant to this,
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.380]   so if it's not, let's separate it out.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.780]   But I'd love for you to tell us a little bit
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:57.620]   about the role of sleep in problem solving and creativity.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.820]   And if spindles are involved,
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.820]   and I'll consider myself lucky for batching them
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.580]   in the same question, and if they're not involved,
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.340]   simply feel free to separate them out.
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.180]   - I think they could be involved.
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.780]   And the reason why I think they could be involved,
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.780]   'cause we now know a lot more about spindles.
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.780]   First of all, the first thing that we knew,
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:13.460]   first of all, we ignored them.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:14.900]   Then we thought they had something to do
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.980]   with keeping us asleep, and that was their function
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:18.820]   is when an external stimulus came,
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:20.980]   they would keep us asleep because they would arise.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:23.940]   But now we know that the density of our sleep spindles,
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:26.500]   the number that we produce per minute
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.460]   is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place,
[01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:31.540]   and that no matter what your intelligence is,
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.500]   and no matter what your sleep spindle density is,
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.660]   if you learn something during the day
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.900]   and increase your sleep spindle density,
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.540]   it's really almost perfectly correlated
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.860]   with our ability to consolidate that information
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.340]   and incorporate it into the schema
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:47.780]   that we already have in our brain.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.260]   So if you try and learn something new,
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:53.140]   even if your sleep spindle density at baseline is great,
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.780]   if you don't increase your sleep spindles that night,
[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:59.540]   you're not gonna use sleep to really incorporate it.
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.740]   Interestingly, sleep spindles are poor
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.180]   in those with schizophrenia.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.100]   It's one of the characteristic signatures of sleep
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.340]   is that sleep spindles are very few and far between,
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:14.980]   which might mean that people with schizophrenia
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:17.380]   might not be able to incorporate new information
[01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:19.140]   into already existing schema,
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.340]   and instead it sort of flaps in the breeze out there
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.780]   and can be accessed erroneously at times when you,
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:28.020]   you know, you don't want it to be involved.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.580]   So I digress.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.100]   So sleep spindles and creativity.
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:33.940]   So one of the things we now know
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.900]   through some great studies by Julie Seep and Anita Luthy
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.180]   is that sleep spindles are accompanied
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:44.900]   by an incredible plasticity out in the distal dendrites,
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.620]   the listening branches of our neurons
[01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:50.580]   that listen to other cortical areas.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:53.220]   So there are proximal dendrites in our neurons
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:56.020]   that listen to the external world
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.180]   and are conducted through the thalamus.
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.540]   And then there are distal dendrites,
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:02.340]   which listen to an internal kind of, you know,
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:05.220]   conversation that's happening in our brains.
[01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:08.340]   It's kind of, you know, our internal state really.
[01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:09.620]   And during sleep spindles,
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:14.500]   that's when those distal dendrites are able to best learn
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:17.380]   from other cortical areas and from the hippocampus.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.100]   It is during sleep spindles at the hippocampus
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.500]   and the cortex are best connected.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.860]   And when that incredible plasticity can happen.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.220]   When I talk about schema,
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.660]   that's a cortical cortical thing.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.220]   That's when, you know, the image of Santa Claus
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:33.140]   and presents, you know, comes together.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.820]   It's not through some external thing.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.820]   Once we learn those things together,
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.900]   it's our cortex that encodes that
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.140]   and brings those images back up together.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.500]   And that's during sleep spindles when that's happening.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.100]   When there's big surges of calcium
[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.500]   into those distal dendrites
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:54.740]   and where plasticity happens in just huge amounts.
[01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:57.780]   During that sleep spindle stage of sleep,
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.460]   which is N2 stage,
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:02.900]   there's also another excitatory event
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.580]   that comes all the way from the brainstem
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:07.140]   and projects everywhere in our cortex,
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.820]   which is called P-Geo waves.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.220]   P for pons,
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.460]   G for geniculate nucleus of the thalamus,
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.220]   which is where they're first discovered,
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.140]   and O for occipital area,
[01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:18.180]   which is our visual area,
[01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.500]   which is again where they're first discovered.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:23.460]   But in fact, it's now been shown that P-Geo waves,
[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:25.460]   which we should generalize to P waves
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.620]   because they come from the pons and go to the thalamus
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:30.500]   and then this cortex happens all over the brains.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.140]   And that is where glutamate,
[01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:35.860]   which is a major excitatory neurotransmitter
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:37.620]   involved in learning and plasticity
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:39.860]   is being released in big amounts
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.380]   also in those distal dendrites.
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:45.460]   So P waves and spindles work together to cause plasticity.
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:46.820]   And so our schema together,
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.980]   which could be the origins for insight and creativity.
[01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:53.700]   Now, when P-Geo waves or P waves are first discovered,
[01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:57.060]   it was thought to be random
[01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.940]   because this small area that generates P waves
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:05.060]   all over the brain projects all over the thalamus
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.340]   and causes P waves all over.
[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:08.820]   And you don't measure P waves
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.260]   all over the brain at the same time.
[01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:13.220]   In fact, it just seems sporadic and random.
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.260]   So that's probably,
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:18.180]   and P waves are also happening even more during REM sleep,
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.300]   rapid eye movement sleep.
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:25.620]   So that's why people think that REM dreams are so random
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.700]   is because these P waves are random
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:30.260]   and they could generate dreams
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:34.500]   because they're an internal source of excitation
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.140]   that kind of replaces the outside world
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.660]   during our dream state.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.300]   And so these P waves, if they are random,
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:45.140]   could function or could be the underlying reason
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.620]   why REM sleep dreams are random.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:51.940]   And it might also be why creativity can happen there
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.500]   is because we're randomly activating,
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:56.660]   coactivating different things in our brain
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.420]   that we can then sew together.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:00.980]   But it might not be as random as we think.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:02.660]   So that's a caveat there.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.260]   - Well, I just learned a lot from you
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:07.780]   because I teach brainstem to medical students
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.100]   and I talk about the pons.
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.700]   And the pons is like this dense collection
[01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.460]   of all these different nuclei involved
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.740]   in a bunch of different things.
[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.300]   And it's close by a bunch of interesting things.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.340]   And it's still kind of a mysterious brain area.
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:22.340]   But when I learned about PGO waves,
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.420]   I thought pons, geniculate, occipital,
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.580]   because occipital is most commonly associated
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.540]   with visual cortex.
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:30.020]   I thought it was the origin
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:32.420]   of the visual component of dreams.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.140]   - It probably is.
[01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:37.060]   - I'm very happy to learn that they should be called P waves
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.540]   because they include lots of different areas of the brain.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.620]   And it makes really good sense to me
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:45.780]   why the kind of pseudo randomness of dreams,
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.020]   especially these late night or an early morning,
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:50.820]   later in sleep, I should say,
[01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:54.180]   and early morning dreams seem to be cobbled together
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:56.420]   from kind of disparate experiences.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:58.820]   You walk through a door and suddenly
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.900]   it's a completely different context and landscape.
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:02.180]   - Yes, beautiful.
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.580]   - Yeah, I like this idea a lot.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.940]   It makes intuitive sense.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.140]   It makes biological sense.
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:08.740]   It also gives me something to talk about
[01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.100]   to the medical students next quarter
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:11.060]   when I talk about pons.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.660]   - You want to talk about where in the pons,
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.740]   it's right below the locus coeruleus.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:16.180]   It's called the subceruleus.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.540]   They're glutamatergic.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:22.100]   It's also called SLD, sub lateral dorsal nucleus.
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:26.820]   - So note to any aspiring neurobiologist,
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:31.060]   there's a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered structure
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.100]   and functions in the pons.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:33.380]   You want to work on something
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:35.060]   that is sure to reveal something novel?
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.380]   Work on the pons because it's in every textbook.
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.260]   It's a clinically very important structure.
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:45.380]   Sadly, gliomas and other cancers of the brain
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.180]   can sometimes, can often surface in the pons,
[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:50.180]   but we still know very little about it.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.940]   I read a paper this last year,
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.580]   and I think it was covered in a bit of popular press,
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.220]   that during rapid eye movement sleep,
[01:34:59.220 --> 01:35:04.580]   people can solve problems or respond to external stimuli.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:06.580]   Like for instance, they would give them math problems.
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:08.980]   They'd whisper in their ear while they were in REM sleep,
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:10.340]   you know, what's two plus two?
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.260]   And people would say, even though they were paralyzed,
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.780]   apparently they could still move their mouth
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.740]   because they'd say four or something like that.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:18.260]   Or they'd say, you know, what's your name?
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:19.220]   And people could respond.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.140]   And so that in REM sleep, perhaps people,
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:25.620]   some elements of cognition are still active.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.300]   - I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.100]   - What do you think?
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.780]   And I don't know the authors of that study.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:33.460]   And listen, if ever I say something wrong,
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.060]   it's great on this podcast
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.220]   because someone will tell us in the YouTube comments.
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:39.540]   It's one of the great uses of YouTube comments,
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:41.860]   but I'd love to know your thoughts on that study.
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:46.340]   I mean, is that just kind of an odd feature
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.020]   or does this have meaning?
[01:35:48.020 --> 01:35:49.540]   Should we actually care about this result?
[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.140]   - There's no just about it.
[01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:53.700]   It's really actually intriguing and interesting
[01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:56.260]   and might relate to this paper that I talked about
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:58.260]   where we said different areas of the brain
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:00.420]   can be in different states at the same time.
[01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:04.340]   So lucid dreaming is another thing we can't ask animals to do
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.940]   or can't ask them if they've done it,
[01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:09.460]   but we can certainly ask humans to do it
[01:36:09.460 --> 01:36:11.460]   and some people can do it really well.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   And it would be really interesting to see
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.780]   in those people who could lucid dream really well,
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.100]   whether they spend more or less time
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:21.140]   in this asymmetrical state
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.980]   where one area of the brain is in one state
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:24.820]   and another area of the brain is in another.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:28.580]   And it might be that those people can respond to questions
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.860]   during REM sleep.
[01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:34.980]   Best are those that have the most asymmetry or dissimilarity
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:38.500]   or dissociation between subcortical and cortical structures.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.740]   Or it might be that they're the ones with the most symmetry.
[01:36:40.740 --> 01:36:41.300]   We don't know.
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:45.060]   I do worry a little bit about lucid dreaming
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.420]   because it's a fad.
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:47.780]   People are really excited about it.
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:51.140]   And to be able to remember one's dreams is fun often
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.180]   unless they're nightmares.
[01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.940]   But it's really interesting.
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.540]   Or to be able to direct one's dreams
[01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:59.060]   if they are a nightmare is really wonderful power to have
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.380]   to be able to redirect a nightmare
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.220]   that has been repeated to something else
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.340]   and then kick yourself out of that repetitive nightmare
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.140]   is really nice.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:12.260]   But I worry a little bit about because we know so little
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:14.420]   about what's actually going on in the brain.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:18.980]   And if this lucid dreaming state is preventing us from,
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:21.300]   for example, from the locus realus from calming down
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.900]   or the serotonergic system from silencing like it should.
[01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.180]   And maybe what we're doing during this state is, yeah,
[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.740]   we're activating the learning and memory structures,
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.580]   but in a way that's maladaptive in terms of the erasure
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.540]   that we need to do.
[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:38.660]   So maybe one of the reasons why most people don't remember
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.820]   most of their dreams is for good reason.
[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:43.620]   Your hippocampus is in a state where it's not writing
[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:44.340]   new memories.
[01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:47.380]   In fact, it's writing out the memories it learned
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.060]   during the day to the cortex.
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:52.820]   And it's immune from incoming new information.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:58.420]   So maybe lucid dreaming is bad because you're activating
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:01.140]   the hippocampus in a way that's writing new memories.
[01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   And it might be really maladaptive for things like PTSD.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.340]   On the other hand, let me just argue myself right out
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:08.840]   of this.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.180]   When I used to have a repeated nightmare when I was a kid,
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.180]   my mother, who's so wise, would tell me, well, listen,
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:21.380]   just next time you're in that dream, say, hey, I'm in a dream
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:22.980]   and then change something about it.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.340]   So she and I rehearsed what the horrible dream that was.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.500]   It was a big monster running after me.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.860]   And my legs were like mud.
[01:38:29.860 --> 01:38:30.820]   And I couldn't run away.
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:32.340]   And it was just terrifying.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.540]   And that was a dream I would have time and time again.
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.860]   She said, OK, next time, what are you going to do?
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.460]   And that monster comes after you.
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:40.500]   I thought, I'm going to run away.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.260]   No, that's what you do every time.
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.700]   And it's always the same outcome.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.420]   You can't run.
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.860]   So let's do something different.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:47.700]   Like, what could you do that's different?
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.980]   So I came up with, well, I could turn around and punch it.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:52.740]   And the nose, yeah, that's great.
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:55.460]   So the next time I had that dream,
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.500]   I did recognize this is that same old dream,
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.340]   which means that there's part of my brain that's
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:04.260]   conscious enough to know that I'm in a dreaming state.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.900]   And then I didn't have the courage in my dream
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.380]   because I was still terrified to punch or touch
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.820]   the monster in any way.
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.140]   But I did have the courage to turn around and look
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:15.620]   it in the eye and say, no, that was enough.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:16.580]   I said, no.
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:20.260]   And that was enough to knock me out of that rut of that dream
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.260]   so that I never had it again.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.580]   I never had that same dream again.
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:27.060]   And in fact, it gave me peace about dreaming
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.380]   because I knew that if ever there
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.300]   was a nightmare that was just too scary,
[01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:34.020]   I could probably do something to change it
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.780]   and knock myself out of it.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:38.500]   So even though I don't recommend lucid dreaming
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:43.380]   on a normal day-to-day basis, if it's enough that can knock you
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:47.300]   out of a rut, one thing that happens with people with PTSD
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:50.580]   is they have the same repeated horrible nightmare, which
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:55.220]   is often a reliving of the day's trauma that they had.
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.900]   So maybe lucid dreaming can be used on occasion
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:04.100]   to be a powerful tool because there's so much plasticity that
[01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.580]   happens during REM sleep to knock you out
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:10.740]   of that rut of reliving that event and just change it.
[01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:13.860]   And you could probably practice that during wakefulness,
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.420]   rehearse the event that happened that was so traumatic,
[01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:23.940]   and then just introduce a new element like now I'm safe.
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.420]   Now the sound that was associated
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.700]   with that really traumatic thing,
[01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:30.340]   I should now associate with something else.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.660]   And next time I have that dream, I'm going to change it.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:34.980]   So that sound is now this new thing
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:37.140]   that should be associated with safety.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.460]   And that might be enough, maybe, I hope,
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:43.380]   to knock you out of that repeated nightmare
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:45.460]   and maybe even start you on the path to recovery.
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:48.180]   Because if you can calm down about those nightmare
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:50.900]   states of sleep, then maybe your locus surrealis,
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:53.540]   which is involved in stress, can also relax.
[01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:56.100]   And you can do the erasure parts that need to be done.
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.860]   I love it.
[01:40:57.860 --> 01:40:59.860]   I seem to recall a paper--
[01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:03.220]   and I'll have to find the reference and send it to you.
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:05.300]   We will also put in the show note captions--
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:10.500]   that described a protocol that essentially matches this idea.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.180]   And I think what they had people do
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.420]   was either cue themselves to a particular smell
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:18.340]   or tone in wakefulness, then to try and recall
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.460]   a recurring nightmare.
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.260]   Then during the night's sleep, they
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.780]   had the tone playing in the background,
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:25.860]   which would then cue them to the wakeful state.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:28.180]   They're still asleep, mind you, but in the pseudo-lucid
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:29.460]   or lucid state.
[01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:33.060]   And then try and change some variable, as you're describing.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:35.780]   Some either look the predator in the eyes
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.820]   or do something different.
[01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:40.420]   And then in the waking state, take a little bit of time
[01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:44.340]   to try and script out a different narrative altogether.
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.820]   And it took several nights, as I recall, or more,
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:49.220]   but that they were able to escape this recurring nightmare.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.580]   Yeah, it was like a week or something.
[01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:52.020]   Oh, so you're familiar with the study.
[01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.220]   Yeah, it's a beautiful study.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:53.940]   I loved it.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.020]   Yeah, we will put a reference to that.
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:58.100]   I need to revisit that study.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.140]   It was pretty recent, but I need to dive into it again,
[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.780]   because I think I didn't go as deep into it as I should have.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:06.740]   No, no, but the one thing that you-- well,
[01:42:06.740 --> 01:42:07.780]   you said many right things.
[01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:09.140]   But one of the things you said is
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:13.380]   that they were able to cue the dreamer when they knew,
[01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.980]   and they were going to REM sleep,
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:17.780]   and then they played the sound or had the odor.
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:20.100]   Now, when you're normally asleep alone in your bed,
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.860]   you're not going to be able to cue yourself.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:25.780]   But it might be that rehearsal enough before you go to sleep
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:29.700]   is enough to help cue you to that repeated nightmare,
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.540]   remembering what the nightmare is,
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.580]   and then figuring out how to cue yourself
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.860]   to do something different.
[01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:38.740]   For years, I had the same recurring nightmare.
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:41.140]   Over and over and over again.
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.820]   And it was so salient and so clear.
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.020]   And I'm not going to share what it is,
[01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:46.100]   because it's not that it's that disturbing.
[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:49.300]   It was just-- I think it was the emotional load of it
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:51.860]   and just how salient certain features were.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:55.300]   Like one person who was a real-life person
[01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:59.300]   had a particular clothing on.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.980]   And it's like, and that just served as this cue.
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:03.060]   And I don't know if I ever did any direct work
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:04.020]   to try and deal with it.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:06.260]   But now it almost seems silly to describe it.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:06.740]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:08.660]   Well, dreams are usually silly to describe.
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:09.620]   Yeah, it was pretty silly.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:11.380]   But it was a pretty violent dream.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:15.140]   Yeah, and your emotional system is so geared up
[01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:16.900]   during REM sleep, which is another thing
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:17.700]   we could talk about.
[01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.060]   Yeah, please.
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.700]   I would love to-- yeah, so locus coeruleus
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.300]   is ideally suppressed.
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.060]   So we can't really snore epinephrine.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.420]   We can't act out our dreams.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:33.140]   During these very emotionally laden thoughts and storylines
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.540]   during sleep, this almost starts to sound
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:40.980]   like a little bit of a built-in while sleeping trauma therapy.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.580]   Because most trauma therapies involve
[01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.020]   trying to get people into states of--
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:47.300]   counter to what most people think you actually
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.940]   want to get close to the trauma in terms of the narrative,
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:52.740]   but try and suppress the emotional activity of it.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.100]   Or I guess that's the motivation for ketamine-based therapies
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.060]   for trauma.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.860]   Or I've also heard-- and this is still perplexing to me--
[01:43:59.860 --> 01:44:03.620]   that other waking-based trauma therapies involve taking people
[01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:05.060]   the other way, making it very cathartic,
[01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:07.300]   take them to the peak of the emotional response,
[01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:09.700]   but then allow that to finally cycle down
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:11.540]   into a more relaxed response.
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:16.260]   So please, if there's anything about locus coeruleus
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:20.180]   and dreams that can help people basically
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:23.940]   extinguish traumas or traumatic features to real-life events,
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.060]   we definitely want to know about them.
[01:44:25.060 --> 01:44:25.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:28.980]   Well, I think one of the things that people
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.140]   thought might help after a trauma,
[01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.300]   like a school shooting or whatever,
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.300]   you know, car accident is to talk about it.
[01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.060]   But in fact, that ended up being counterproductive.
[01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:41.380]   And I think one of the reasons why it was counterproductive
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:44.100]   is because it didn't take them back down.
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:47.700]   It brought them up and continued to reactivate
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:52.340]   the emotions of it, but then didn't emphasize the safety
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:56.740]   effect that it's over or help them work through how they
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:44:58.420]   might avoid it again in the future
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:02.180]   to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.460]   before they went to sleep.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:06.740]   And none of these studies has sleep ever been considered.
[01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:10.500]   But to me, that's the key part is bringing down
[01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.900]   your sympathetic nervous system before you go to sleep
[01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:14.980]   so that your sleep can be adaptive,
[01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:17.780]   your locus coeruleus can shut off like it normally does
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:23.220]   or should do, and then able to erase the novelty of it.
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:27.060]   The other thing that I just mentioned a minute ago
[01:45:27.060 --> 01:45:30.260]   is that the emotional system is highly activated in REM sleep.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.780]   And that's definitely true.
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:33.860]   And that might seem counterproductive
[01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:39.220]   in terms of the nightmares and how to help REM sleep
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:45.860]   be a therapeutic thing rather than reinforcing
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.940]   the emotionality of the trauma.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:50.100]   And I think the key to that, again,
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:52.100]   is the absence of norepinephrine.
[01:45:52.100 --> 01:45:56.340]   So even though the emotional system is in high gear,
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:03.300]   without norepinephrine, you can actually divorce
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:08.900]   those highly activated emotions from the cognitive parts
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:11.060]   of the memory that you have just written out
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:15.300]   in that NT stage of sleep when the sleep spindles are going.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:19.540]   So you've just now consolidated the information
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:23.380]   that you'll need to survive and to make that adaptive.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:27.300]   And now you need to divorce from that schema
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:31.220]   and from that semantic parts of memory the emotional part.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:33.060]   Because whenever you remember something,
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:37.780]   it's fine if you remember being emotional at the time,
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:41.220]   but you don't want to bring back and sew into that memory
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:42.740]   all of the same emotional systems.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.020]   You don't want to bring back the heart rate changes
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.500]   and the sweating and all of that.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.980]   You want to be able to remember all the parts of it
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:53.220]   and even remember that you were traumatized
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.540]   and that you did cry and that you did have,
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.700]   you know, your heart was racing.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:47:00.580]   But when you're talking about it years later,
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.100]   you don't want to have to relive all that.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:06.180]   Otherwise, who would ever want to recall a traumatic memory
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:07.540]   because you're basically putting yourself
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:08.420]   through the same trauma,
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:10.740]   which is what people with PTSD have.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:13.300]   They don't want to recall this traumatic memory
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:16.820]   because it's reliving it like it's just happening again.
[01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:21.220]   So that's what we're thinking is that the emotional parts
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.420]   are not able to be divorced
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.580]   because the neurocerenorphine system
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:28.660]   is not downscaled during REM sleep.
[01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:33.140]   And so that REM sleep serves to instead reinforce
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:35.140]   and in fact amplify the emotions
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:37.940]   because your emotional system is up,
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.500]   locus surrealis is high, re-sewing in every night
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.420]   the emotionality of those memories
[01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:45.620]   and with the memory itself.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:50.260]   You've told us a lot about locus surrealis
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.020]   and norepinephrine from locus surrealis.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:56.740]   Is there any role for norepinephrine, epinephrine,
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:58.660]   and cortisol released from the adrenals?
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:04.100]   My understanding is that norepinephrine and epinephrine
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:06.020]   will not cross the blood-brain barrier,
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.500]   which is probably why we have a brain-based
[01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:12.660]   noradrenergic system, locus surrealis and other neurons.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:14.660]   Actually, that's a question I should ask you.
[01:48:14.660 --> 01:48:16.660]   Are there other sites in the brain where norepinephrine
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.220]   is released from or is it just locus surrealis?
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:23.780]   So there are seven, nine different adrenergic,
[01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:26.900]   yes, there's nine different adrenergic structures.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.220]   I'm sorry, I didn't ask, but it just occurred to me
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:31.940]   that in some cases like with Rafe,
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:35.860]   there are other sources of serotonergic drive in the brain,
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:38.340]   but Rafe is like the main site.
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:40.020]   That's the one that goes to the cortex
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:42.740]   and the locus surrealis is also the one
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:44.100]   that goes to the cortex.
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:45.860]   But there are other adrenergic sources,
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:48.500]   some from the brainstem that descend
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.380]   and help us to ignore pain, for example,
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.140]   when we're stressed and needing to run away from the tiger.
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:57.380]   We don't want to be thinking, oh, my ankle hurts.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.740]   You want to just be able to ignore it
[01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.020]   and go do what you need to do.
[01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:05.700]   Yeah, so there are lots of other noradrenergic nuclei,
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:07.460]   but the locus surrealis is the main one
[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:09.060]   that projects all over the brain.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:10.820]   Actually, the only place it doesn't project
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.340]   is the dorsal striatum.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.820]   You talked about ventral striatum and addiction.
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.740]   The dorsal striatum is the only place
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.060]   the locus surrealis doesn't project to
[01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:22.580]   and that's involved in procedural learning, motor learning.
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:25.060]   The kinds of learning that take over
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:28.020]   when your hippocampus, for example, is compromised,
[01:49:28.020 --> 01:49:29.940]   bilateral if you don't have a good hippocampus,
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.820]   you can still do procedural learning and it's great.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:33.940]   It's a redundant system.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:37.780]   And so if your locus surrealis is not working,
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.220]   if you don't have it anymore,
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:41.940]   you can still do, if you don't have a good hippocampus,
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.060]   you can still do learning
[01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:44.980]   through this dorsal striatum structure.
[01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:48.980]   So it might be for those kinds of learning functions,
[01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:52.580]   sleep deprivation where you never let
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.620]   the locus surrealis stop firing is okay
[01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:58.020]   because it doesn't have any receptors
[01:49:58.020 --> 01:49:59.380]   for norepinephrine anyway.
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.900]   So yeah.
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:03.780]   And what about bodily, like adrenals?
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:05.380]   Yes, adrenals, yeah.
[01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:07.060]   You know, I often remind people
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:09.460]   there's no such thing as adrenal burnout per se,
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:12.260]   that adrenals don't actually burn out.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:16.020]   But some people have adrenal insufficiency syndrome.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.980]   Other people have adrenals that are just chronically
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:22.260]   cranking out epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:25.380]   and cortisol at the wrong times in particular.
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:26.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:29.940]   So those are great questions
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:33.220]   and I think the answers to them have yet to be discovered,
[01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:35.140]   the connections between our periphery
[01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:36.580]   and our central nervous system.
[01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.980]   But we know that there are beautiful connections
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:42.980]   and its untapped source of being able to manipulate
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:45.620]   our brains is to work through our bodies.
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:49.140]   And so, adrenals do great things.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:50.900]   They constrict our blood vessels,
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.580]   causing higher blood pressure,
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:55.700]   which help blood rush out to all the extremities
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:59.060]   that need blood, you know, our muscles, for example,
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:03.060]   for running away from the lion or the tiger or whatever.
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:04.660]   Or meeting a grand deadline.
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.940]   Or meeting a grand deadline.
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:06.980]   Or catching a train.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:08.180]   Or catching a train, yeah.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:11.300]   The adrenals help our hearts bump faster.
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:15.300]   Our muscles get perfused with the blood it needs.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.420]   It diverts blood and everything away
[01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:22.580]   from our parasympathetic system, which is rest and digest.
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:24.820]   We don't really need to digest that croissant
[01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.020]   when we're running for a train.
[01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:26.980]   We can do that later.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:31.380]   So it's doing really important things.
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:33.300]   What we don't know, because it doesn't cross
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:36.020]   the blood-brain barrier, is how that affects the brain
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:39.860]   and whether our, if we can independently activate
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:44.420]   our adrenals, when a time when our brain thinks
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:46.580]   that we should be fine and calm and asleep,
[01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:49.380]   how our brain detects that.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.500]   Is it a feedback through, our heart is racing,
[01:51:52.500 --> 01:51:54.740]   and then our brain stem says, what's going on?
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:55.620]   My heart is racing.
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.060]   And then wakes us up.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.980]   And then our hearts were racing together
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.260]   with our brain racing.
[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.020]   We just don't know the answers to these questions yet.
[01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.500]   There are some good studies, old studies,
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:09.060]   but we need a lot more.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.340]   - Very well.
[01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:13.060]   Another nod to the fact that there's lots of great work
[01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.900]   ongoing and still to do.
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:17.300]   I'd love for you to tell us about some of the work
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:19.380]   that you're doing more recently on the relationship
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:24.740]   between sleep and opiate use, withdrawal,
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:29.060]   relapse, and craving, just addiction generally.
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:32.660]   I get a lot of questions about people trying
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:36.740]   to come off benzodiazepines or people's challenges
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:39.380]   with benzodiazepine and other types of addiction.
[01:52:39.380 --> 01:52:43.300]   Yeah, what is the role of sleep in addiction
[01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.020]   and recovery from addiction and opiates in particular?
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.980]   - Yeah, well, this is a very young area.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:51.140]   And in fact, my laboratory has just started.
[01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:53.860]   I have a graduate student who's been in my lab
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:54.740]   for just one year.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:57.220]   She's done amazing work already,
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:59.460]   but completely groundbreaking work.
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:01.620]   And what she has discovered already,
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:02.980]   we don't have the paper out yet,
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:04.740]   but we're working on it,
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:09.620]   is that when animals withdraw from opiates
[01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:12.340]   and this has been sort of replicated in other ways
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:16.260]   with other types of things, our sleep is disturbed.
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:17.860]   Our sleep is terribly disturbed.
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:19.860]   And the amount of sleep disturbance
[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:21.700]   predicts relapse behaviors.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.100]   And you might think, well, of course,
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.940]   you're going to relapse if you can't sleep
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:27.300]   because opiates calm you down.
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.220]   Well, one of the reasons why opiates calm you down
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:31.460]   is because the locus coeruleus, again,
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:34.500]   blue spot is covered with opiate receptors
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.980]   that are normally really responsive
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:38.820]   to our endogenous opiates.
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:43.860]   And so what happens when we're pleased, for example,
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:46.500]   or laughing or whatever, our endogenous opiates
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:49.780]   activate those receptors in the locus coeruleus
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:50.820]   and calm it down.
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:54.980]   And it actually suppresses locus coeruleus activity,
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:56.820]   makes us happy and relaxed.
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:53:59.460]   One of the reasons why opiates are so addictive
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:03.060]   is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.500]   But the problem with exogenous opiates
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:10.500]   is that they really strongly bind these receptors
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.860]   on our locus coeruleus.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:15.220]   And if you take exogenous opiates again and again,
[01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:17.140]   like you're recovering from surgery, for example,
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:19.060]   and take these pain medications,
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.900]   is that our locus coeruleus struggles
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:23.780]   to do what it's supposed to do, which is keep us awake
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.180]   and learning and concentrating on things.
[01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:27.780]   So it will downregulate.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.860]   It will internalize these receptors
[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:33.140]   that are normally only occupied by endogenous opiates.
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.020]   And it will do this, it will change our genes
[01:54:36.020 --> 01:54:38.740]   that are associated with producing these receptors.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.140]   So you actually have very many fewer receptors.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.540]   So the locus coeruleus, at least during wakefulness,
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:45.860]   can fire and help us to do these things,
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:48.100]   like learn about our environment.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:50.340]   And so if you long-term reduce
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:51.860]   the number of receptors out there,
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:54.980]   then when you withdraw the exogenous opiates,
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:57.620]   there is not enough of your endogenous opiates
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:02.660]   to be able to occupy those few receptors that are there.
[01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:05.220]   And our locus coeruleus has nothing to calm it down anymore,
[01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:06.500]   no pacifier.
[01:55:06.500 --> 01:55:08.660]   And it just fires and fires and fires.
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:14.340]   And that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.980]   because it's normally associated with stress.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:20.020]   And so any exogenous stressor that adds to that
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:22.340]   and also activates our locus coeruleus,
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.340]   there's nothing to calm it down again.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.180]   And so it just keeps firing.
[01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.380]   It disturbs our sleep.
[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:30.660]   And that's why maybe sleep disturbance
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:35.700]   is an indicator of a hyperactive locus coeruleus
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:40.260]   and such a good predictor of relapse behaviors
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:43.860]   because nobody likes to live in that high stress state.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:47.940]   And they will do anything to get back to normal.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.500]   So the problem with taking these drugs
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:59.540]   is that it leaves you relaxed and happy.
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:00.660]   But then when you come off of it,
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:04.100]   you're worse than when you were at baseline.
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:04.900]   You take it again.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:07.300]   It only brings you up this far
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.820]   because you have fewer receptors.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.700]   When you come off it,
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:13.140]   you're down even more depressed and anxious.
[01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.100]   And depressed is a word I use loosely.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.380]   And that's not what I should say.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.380]   Certainly central nervous system depression.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.140]   I mean, sleepier, less motivated, lower mood.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.300]   I mean, our locus coeruleus is actually,
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.180]   it's the anxiety kind of depression,
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:29.940]   actually the anxiety related depression.
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:32.180]   So yeah.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.820]   So we don't know yet what,
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.580]   and there's some good research going on right now,
[01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:40.580]   what could restore our own endogenous receptors
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.260]   so that our own endogenous opiates
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:44.980]   can properly calm our locus coeruleus.
[01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:49.460]   Once that they have been tamped down by exogenous opiates,
[01:56:49.460 --> 01:56:51.220]   but that would be really one way
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:53.940]   that you can access the sleep disturbance.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.420]   So we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:57.620]   in terms of learning and memory,
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:58.820]   the importance of the structure
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:01.620]   of the 90 minute cycle for all of that.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.700]   So you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:05.460]   by too much locus coeruleus activity,
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:10.740]   the structure and the function of those sleep spindles
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:12.260]   and that theta during REM sleep
[01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:14.820]   and the lack of norepinephrine,
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.900]   all of those structures,
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:20.900]   all those functions for learning something new,
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.820]   like a new behavior that doesn't involve the drugs
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.740]   becomes compromised.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.980]   And so that's something that Tania Lugos
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:32.420]   in collaboration with Pamela Kennedy at UCLA
[01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:33.540]   that we're looking at,
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.380]   how is learning and memory affected
[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:36.580]   by the sleep disturbance?
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:37.700]   If there a way we can,
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.820]   in animals that have coming off of opiates,
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:43.140]   can we restore their sleeps to normal
[01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:45.220]   so that then they are less likely
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:48.500]   to do relapse kinds of behaviors.
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:50.500]   - Fascinating.
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:53.620]   And I will certainly have to have you back on
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:57:55.300]   to tell us the results of those studies.
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:57:56.740]   Meanwhile, I think for anyone
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.900]   who's trying to come off opiates,
[01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.780]   exogenous opiates and restore these systems,
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.060]   what I'm hearing is that it's going to take some time,
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:07.380]   but that any and all things that people can do
[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:10.740]   to buffer their healthy normal sleep architecture,
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:12.660]   like morning and daytime sunlight,
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:14.020]   limiting bright light exposure,
[01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:15.380]   lowering the temperature at night,
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:16.500]   a number of things that we've talked about
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.780]   in this podcast. - Calming yourself,
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.260]   deep breathing exercises, exercises, meditation,
[01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.100]   whatever it is that helps you calm yourself
[01:58:22.100 --> 01:58:22.900]   before sleep, yeah.
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:25.380]   - Right, would facilitate not just sleep,
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.500]   but perhaps even accelerate the recovery
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.820]   and shorten this period of withdrawal,
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.740]   which from the questions I get
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:36.420]   and from what I hear can be absolutely brutal.
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.340]   - Yeah, oh, I can imagine.
[01:58:38.340 --> 01:58:40.900]   I had to take opiates for,
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.300]   I only took it for three days after giving birth
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:47.220]   to my first son, I think, second son, one of them.
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.380]   And I just said after three days, this is enough.
[01:58:51.380 --> 01:58:53.060]   I'm just going to try Tylenol.
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:56.260]   And so I weaned myself, not weaned.
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.260]   I just did a sudden sharp cutoff.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:58:59.780]   And even though I felt,
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:02.500]   I didn't get the high of opiates
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:06.180]   when I was taking the Tylenol codeine.
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:08.900]   When I went off it, boy,
[01:59:08.900 --> 01:59:10.980]   it was like PMS times 100.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:15.060]   I was so anxious and upset at little things
[01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:16.820]   and thankfully only lasted a few hours.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:19.300]   But if I had taken it for a week or two weeks,
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:22.820]   who knows if my endogenous opiate receptors
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:24.740]   would have been permanently down-regulated
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:28.100]   and I would have been an addict, an addict.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:29.060]   I would have been addicted.
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.340]   I shouldn't say an addict.
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:31.700]   There's negative connotations.
[01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:33.540]   It's just a very physiological state.
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:37.140]   So no judgments at all associated with it.
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:41.140]   So yeah, they're powerful, powerful painkillers,
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.340]   but can also alter your entire brain and rewire it.
[01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:47.940]   - Well, all the more reason why I and many others
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:49.300]   are grateful that you're doing this work
[01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:51.460]   to figure out ways that people can recover
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:54.020]   more quickly and more thoroughly.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:58.340]   I must say you've taught us a tremendous amount
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.980]   in a relatively short amount of time
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:04.340]   about the architecture of sleep, the different phases,
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:06.340]   the relationship between sleep and dreaming
[02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.420]   and this incredible structure, locus coeruleus.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:10.340]   And I'm so happy we also got into the ponds
[02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:13.220]   that just delights me because we rarely talk
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:14.580]   about the ponds on this podcast,
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:15.940]   but it's such an interesting structure.
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:19.620]   Sex differences that are important in creativity
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:22.580]   and problem solving and trauma, sleep spindles,
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:24.900]   just such a wealth of information
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.380]   and much of it that's actionable for people.
[02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.220]   So first of all, I want to say thank you
[02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:30.420]   for taking the time to sit down
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:32.580]   and have this conversation that so many people
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:33.860]   are sure to benefit from.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.860]   I also want to thank you for doing the work you do,
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:37.860]   even though I'm a fellow neurobiologist.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:42.900]   I think that it's not often that we take a step back
[02:00:42.900 --> 02:00:44.820]   and realize that it's really the work
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:52.660]   of hard thinking, hard, strongly motivated PIs,
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.660]   it stands for principal investigator by the way,
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:57.060]   PIs like yourself, graduate students and postdocs
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:00:58.740]   that really drive the discovery forward
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:00.340]   and that lead to these new therapeutics.
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.100]   Physicians are wonderful.
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:03.860]   Clinicians are absolutely wonderful,
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:05.780]   but clinicians don't develop new treatments.
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:08.660]   They only implement the ones that researchers discover.
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:11.140]   So thank you for being a brain explorer
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:15.620]   with a focus on growing the good in the world.
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:19.780]   I know I speak for everybody when I say thank you so much.
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:21.540]   - Thank you so much, Andrew.
[02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:23.540]   Thank you for being an amazing interviewer.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:26.580]   You brought a lot out of me in a coherent fashion
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:28.820]   that normally I can't do when I'm speaking in public.
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:29.940]   - I don't know about that.
[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:31.540]   I've heard your lectures and they're superb.
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:33.060]   We'll direct people to some of the other ones.
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:34.100]   - Well, thank you.
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.500]   And I also want to put a plug in for graduate students
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:39.220]   in general and the key and amazing role
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:40.500]   that they play in research.
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.540]   I'm a PI, as you said.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:46.820]   I used to be a graduate student and a postdoc trainee myself
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:50.260]   doing all of this on the ground hands-on experimentation.
[02:01:50.260 --> 02:01:51.540]   It's so hard to do.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:52.740]   It's so hard to do right.
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:54.580]   It's so hard to think through all of that.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:57.940]   Now I'm a PI, I get to be an idea person and just say,
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:01:58.980]   hey, why don't you do this?
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:01.060]   And hey, what do you think about that?
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:04.660]   And they, of course, intellectually contribute so much
[02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:08.260]   to these planned experiments,
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:10.340]   but they also do the really hard work.
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.180]   And so I just want to say thank you, graduate students.
[02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:15.460]   Thank you to my graduate students
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.900]   and all graduate students out there.
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:17.740]   Thank you, postdocs.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:21.220]   - We're all underpaid and to the major institutions,
[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.460]   Stanford, UCLA, and all other major institutions,
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.060]   pay them more, please.
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:27.620]   We need them and they need to have a standard of living.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:30.900]   I'm not afraid to say that despite my primary employer.
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:32.660]   Pay them more, they need it, they deserve it.
[02:02:32.660 --> 02:02:34.100]   - They deserve it, absolutely.
[02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:37.220]   - Great, well, we will absolutely have you back again
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:38.980]   if you'll be willing.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:41.060]   And meanwhile, we will direct people
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.900]   to where they can learn more about you
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:43.860]   and your exciting work.
[02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:45.300]   And once again, thanks so much.
[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.260]   - Thank you so much.
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:48.580]   - Thank you for joining me today for my discussion
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:51.380]   about sleep, mental health, physical health, and performance
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:52.900]   with Dr. Gina Poe.
[02:02:52.900 --> 02:02:54.820]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:56.260]   and as actionable as I did.
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:02:59.620]   In fact, I'm already implementing the regularity of bedtime
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.140]   plus or minus half an hour
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:03.140]   in order to get that growth hormone release.
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:05.620]   And I can already see both my sleep scores improving
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.580]   and my feelings of daytime vigor and focus
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:11.380]   and other markers of sleep health improving as well.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:13.700]   If you're learning from and or enjoying this podcast,

[02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:33.460]   I do read all the comments.
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.700]   In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned
[02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:37.700]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.100]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:42.980]   On the Huberman Lab Podcast, we often discuss supplements.
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.300]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.300]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.940]   for things like enhancing the quality and duration of sleep,
[02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:52.580]   for enhancing focus, and for hormone support.
[02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:54.580]   The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.820]   that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements.
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:58.020]   We've done that for several reasons.
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:03:59.700]   First of all, Momentous Supplements
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:01.220]   are of the very highest quality.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.980]   Second of all, they mainly focus
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:04.820]   on single ingredient formulations,
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:06.900]   which is absolutely key if you want to develop
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.540]   a supplement regimen that's most biologically
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:10.500]   and cost-effective.
[02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.660]   It, for instance, allows you to alternate dosages
[02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:15.780]   across days to change the dosages of individual ingredients,
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:17.060]   so on and so forth.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:19.780]   In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.940]   which we know is important because many of you reside
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:23.540]   outside of the United States.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.060]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:27.700]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast, please go to Live Momentous,
[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:31.460]   spelled O-U-S, so that's livemomentous.com/huberman,
[02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:34.180]   and you can get a 20% discount on any of those supplements.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:37.140]   Again, it's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:40.260]   The Huberman Lab Podcast has a zero-cost newsletter
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:43.540]   that includes summaries of podcast episodes and toolkits,
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:46.260]   so checklists of actionable tools that you can use
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.260]   for all aspects of mental health, physical health,
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:49.300]   and performance.
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.300]   You can access this completely zero cost
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.620]   by going to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:55.140]   and scroll down to newsletter.
[02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:56.260]   Just put it in your email.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:58.500]   We do not share your email with anybody,
[02:04:58.500 --> 02:04:59.860]   and you will get our monthly newsletter.
[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:02.500]   And there are also some examples of previous newsletters
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.580]   also there at HubermanLab.com.
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:06.660]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.740]   it is Huberman Lab on all platforms,
[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.860]   Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[02:05:11.860 --> 02:05:13.780]   And at all of those places, I cover science
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.940]   and science-related tools, some of which overlap
[02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:17.780]   with the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:05:17.780 --> 02:05:19.060]   but much of which is distinct
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:20.820]   from the Huberman Lab Podcast content.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:23.860]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:25.780]   Thank you again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:29.380]   with Dr. Gina Poe, all about sleep and its relationship
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:31.780]   to mental health, physical health, and performance.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:33.940]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:35.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:38.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.780]   (upbeat music)
