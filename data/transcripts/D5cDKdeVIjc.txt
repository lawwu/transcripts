[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   We're a platform for builders.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   We provide tools specifically for builders
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.600]   who want to get started very fast.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.140]   Most importantly, we provide the database layer.
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.620]   So we offer a Postgres database.
[00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.600]   And then on top of that, we've got a couple of other tools
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.600]   and authentication system, a storage layer for large files,
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.760]   some edge functions for heavy compute,
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.920]   and then some auto-generated APIs.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.960]   And then most relevant for this podcast
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.440]   is we also have this vector offering
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.280]   powered by pgVector, which is an extension for Postgres.
