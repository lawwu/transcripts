[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.940]   There's an app called Pepper,
[00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.000]   which is a place you can go buy gift cards.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   And you can use a credit card to buy gift cards.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.340]   And you know, speculation is that Pepper's raised
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.840]   so much venture capital money
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.840]   that they're subsidizing gift cards
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.280]   at a pretty aggressive level.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.360]   You earn Pepper points when you buy gift cards
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.200]   and you can use them to buy more gift cards,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.720]   which just saying it out loud sounds ridiculous.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.280]   But you can earn upwards of like 12% back on Amazon,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.960]   buying Amazon gift cards,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.880]   but you earn it in the form of Pepper points.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.400]   And so the answer is like, what do you do with them?
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.480]   You buy more gift cards.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.680]   That is the only thing I know you could do
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.720]   with Pepper points.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.360]   But if you're looking at trying to offset
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.600]   when you buy things so that you can get a better deal
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.360]   and you're willing to take on some risk
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.180]   that the extra points, these bonus points,
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.320]   sometimes they say will pay out 4% now
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.080]   and another 8% in two weeks.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.280]   Obviously Pepper goes out of business in two weeks.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.640]   You're not gonna get that 8%.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.560]   But yeah, Pepper is interesting app for buying gift cards.
