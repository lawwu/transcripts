[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   I got this reputation very quickly about having some of the best pitches in Hollywood.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.920]   And the irony was, it was like, I wasn't really doing anything.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.960]   Like I was doing less.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320]   I was saying less.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.000]   I wasn't trying as hard.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.920]   I happened to be conveying more confidence.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.600]   I was able to get the buyers to offer more of their suggestions.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.440]   Like everything just started going my way.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.640]   And so we started to develop this system that it was like what we use in the edit bay of a
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.360]   three-minute scene.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.360]   Like you can't have a scene go more than three minutes.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.280]   You have to resolve all the conflict, blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.880]   It's like, there's a lot of science behind three minutes itself about how the human brain
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560]   processes information and makes decisions.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.040]   And so I just realized like I'm using this three-minute rule across everything.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.920]   And when I started to apply that across other businesses besides television,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.560]   it worked even better than it did in television.
