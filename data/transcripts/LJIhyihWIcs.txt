[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.580]   Life is hard and God is good. This was the point John Piper made in his sermon
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.160]   "Thank God for the Mercies of Christ" preached on November 19th, 2000 on
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720]   Lamentations chapter 3. Here's what he said.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.600]   Lamentations chapter 3. You may have a hard time finding it. It's a teeny little
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.080]   book sandwiched between Jeremiah the big prophet and Ezekiel. And it's a book
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   that I do not expect many of you to know anything about because it is so small
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.080]   and so tucked away there. Doesn't get read very much and one of the reasons it
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.720]   doesn't is because it's such a horrible book. Because it is so shot through with
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.200]   with horrific pictures of the judgment of God upon Jerusalem. Jeremiah wrote
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.080]   this little book as Jerusalem was destroyed in 587 BC and the pictures of
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.640]   destruction are terrible, loss of life, starvation through siege. But, and here's
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.080]   the amazing thing, in the middle of this five chapter book, the middle chapter,
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.680]   comes some of the sweetest, most precious words that God has ever put in the
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.720]   mouth of a prophet to tell to his people. And those are the ones I want to read.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.840]   Because they have a special punch when you realize where they are. Verse 21 to
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   25 of chapter 3 of Lamentations go like this, "This I recall to mind and
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.520]   therefore I have hope. The Lord's loving kindnesses never cease. His compassions
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.480]   or His mercies never fail. They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.600]   The Lord is my portion, says my soul, therefore I have hope in Him. The Lord is
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:10.520]   good to those who wait for Him, to the person who seeks Him." Now that should
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:16.880]   boggle your mind because those precious words, especially the words, "His mercies
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.920]   are new every morning," is spoken in a situation that was horrific in its
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.640]   suffering. The afflictions, the devastation, parents were eating their
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.440]   children. They were so hungry and the siege was so horrible. Now how did these
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   words, how did these words get into that book? And as a partial explanation I want
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.440]   to read two more verses. Drop your eyes down to verses 32 and 33. "For if He,"
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.760]   meaning God, "if He causes grief, then He will have compassion according to His
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   abundant loving kindness. For He does not afflict willingly or grieve the sons of
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:17.040]   men." Now the very least we can draw out of those verses is this, the mercies of
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.000]   God are often hidden and hard to see while they are happening. Because it says
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.320]   He does cause grief and He does afflict and yet it says there's a merciful
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.920]   purpose in it all and it's not coming from the bottom of His heart. He does not
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.320]   willingly afflict the sons of men. There are purposes for His affliction. It's not
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   the thing He delights most to do and yet He does it. And if we'll trust Him, there
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.800]   are mercies hidden there for us. It's just like the book of Job. You know the
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.680]   story of Job. He lost everything he had. He lost ten of his children, all of them.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.440]   He lost all of his possessions. He lost all of his health and James, Jesus' brother,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.920]   thousands of years later, in his little book called James, writes in chapter 5
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.040]   verse 11 this interpretation of that book. He says, "You have heard the
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.120]   endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.080]   Lord is full of compassion and is merciful." So there's the point of the
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.800]   book of Job according to James. He lost all of his children. He lost all of his
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.160]   health. He lost his possessions and this says the purpose of the Lord was
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.520]   compassion and merciful. So if we'll trust Him, that's the meaning of the
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.800]   destruction of Jerusalem. That's the meaning of the loss of his health. And I
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.040]   don't know where you are this morning, but if you will trust God, mercy is in
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.600]   your life right now. It is all over your life. Mercy, a design, a compassionate
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.560]   design. If you will trust God and hold on to Him for that, it will show itself
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.440]   sooner or later. We could say it in the words of Susan Shelley, Marshall Shelley's
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.600]   wife. Marshall Shelley is one of the editors for Christianity Today. 1991,
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.160]   November 22, a few days before Thanksgiving, 820 p.m. their son was born
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:41.000]   and at 822, two minutes later, he died. Marshall wrote an article in CT about
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   four years ago about it called "Two Minutes to Eternity." Magnificent article.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.280]   The nurse standing over her, holding her dead baby said, "Does the baby have a
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:04.880]   name?" And she said, "Toby." It's short for a biblical name, Tobiah, which means God
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.960]   is good. And when Marshall came to speak to the Wheaton alumni a few years ago
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.400]   down at Wheaton and told this story, he said at the end of his talk, summing it
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:30.440]   all up, "Life is hard and God is good." Life is hard and God is good. That's
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.400]   the meaning of lamentations. That's the meaning of Job. You might say that's the
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   meaning of the Bible. Life is hard and God is good. And many of you are right in
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.760]   the midst of proving it to be so. Now, at least if you would trust him, if I could
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.120]   persuade you this morning that God is trustworthy in it and he held on to it,
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:02.400]   you would discover that life is hard and God is good. Oh, that God this morning
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.960]   would give us eyes to see his mercies in our lives and we would see them all the
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.160]   more clearly and know that they were mercies if we knew the price that he
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.680]   paid for them for us. He sent his Son, Jesus Christ, into the world to die so
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.960]   that my guilt would be taken away, his wrath would be removed from me, and there
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.760]   would be a free, open course for his mercies to flow to me while he is just,
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.080]   even though I'm a sinner, I could be treated with mercy. That's a glorious
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.840]   thing that God has done in Jesus Christ and we would taste the mercies all the
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.640]   more sweetly if we knew the price. That was from John Pepper's sermon, "Thank God
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.400]   for the Mercies of Christ," preached on November 19th, 2000, on Lamentations
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.200]   chapter 3. Thank you, podcast listener Calvin Katzma, for the recommendation. You
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.520]   can find the full message on our site, along with a couple thousand other

[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.400]   suffering now or if you know others who are, this video is glorious and helpful
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.080]   and hope-giving. Well, John Piper returns tomorrow coming off a six-week writing
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.320]   leave and we'll talk to him about how he researches, plans, and writes books. And
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.360]   then, of course, we'll ask him specifically to talk to us about the
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.000]   book that he just wrote. That begins tomorrow. Until then, I'm your host Tony
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.600]   Ranke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.260]   you
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.320]   you
