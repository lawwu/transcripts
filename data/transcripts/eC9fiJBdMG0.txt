[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.540]   Recently, the Huberman Lab hosted a live event
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.500]   at the Meridian Theater in Toronto, Ontario.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.140]   The event consisted of a lecture entitled
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.380]   The Brain-Body Contract,
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.700]   followed by a question and answer session.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.980]   We wanted to make sure that the question and answer session
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.380]   was available to everybody,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.660]   regardless of who could attend in person.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.620]   I also want to make sure to thank the sponsors
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.980]   at that event, which were AG1 and 8Sleep.
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.540]   8Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling, heating,
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.280]   and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.440]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.820]   is to make sure that the temperature
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.540]   of your sleeping environment is correct.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.140]   And that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.800]   your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.500]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.260]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.940]   With 8Sleep, you can program the temperature
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.260]   of your sleeping environment in the beginning, middle,
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.540]   and end of your night.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.700]   It has a number of other features
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.540]   like tracking the amount of rapid eye movement
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.940]   and slow wave sleep that you get,
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.140]   things that are essential to really dialing in
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.740]   the perfect night's sleep for you.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.340]   I've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress cover
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.020]   for well over two years now,
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.920]   and it has greatly improved my sleep.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.700]   I fall asleep far more quickly,
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.900]   I wake up far less often in the middle of the night,
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.740]   and I wake up feeling far more refreshed than I ever did
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340]   prior to using an 8Sleep mattress cover.
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.620]   If you'd like to try 8Sleep,
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.260]   you can go to 8sleep.com/huberman
[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.140]   to save $150 off their pod three cover.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.940]   8Sleep currently ships to the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.020]   select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.900]   Again, that's 8sleep.com/huberman.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.620]   AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.260]   I've been taking AG1 since 2012,
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.060]   so I'm delighted that they sponsored the live event.
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.800]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.100]   and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.860]   is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.420]   That is, it provides insurance that I get the proper amounts
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.260]   of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and fiber
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.300]   to ensure optimal mental health,
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.460]   physical health, and performance.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.860]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.140]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.700]   to claim a special offer.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.460]   They're giving away five free travel packs
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.300]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.620]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440]   to claim that special offer.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.900]   And now without further ado,
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.300]   the question and answer session from our live event
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.200]   at the Meridian Theater in Toronto, Ontario.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:43.660]   Okay, what motivated me to do the guest series
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.500]   with Paul Conti?
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.440]   Okay, so first of all, for those of you that don't know,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.100]   Paul Conti is a psychiatrist.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.500]   He's a Stanford and Harvard trained psychiatrist.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.980]   And I wanted to do the series with Paul for several reasons.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.880]   And we initiated that series.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.860]   First of all, he's incredibly talented as a clinician.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.820]   And yet, despite having written an excellent book
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.440]   about trauma, I felt that two things were true for sure.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.180]   One is that most people won't get the opportunity
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.580]   to work with Paul, sadly, he's time limited.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.720]   And second, that his expertise is incredibly vast,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.700]   not just restricted to trauma.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.380]   Traumas, if understood, can be transmuted
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.980]   into deep sources of knowledge
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.380]   that other people can benefit from.
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.440]   And indeed, what I found in Paul, as I got to know him,
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.340]   is that he has just profound insight
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.400]   into the unconscious mind.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.900]   And people had long asked me in and around the podcast,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.080]   what about the subconscious?
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.180]   What about the unconscious?
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.360]   And I was of the mind that the supercomputer
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.140]   of the human brain is the forebrain.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.380]   The thinking, planning, context setting piece
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.980]   right behind our forehead.
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.060]   So it's the reason that we're not the house cats.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.700]   The house cats are the house cats.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.140]   And that's the reason we're the curators of the planet.
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.700]   But Paul said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.780]   The unconscious mind is the supercomputer of the mind.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.820]   I'm like, well, that sounds great,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.520]   but how do we understand the unconscious mind?
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.140]   And he has a really biological
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.040]   and psychological and psychiatric understanding
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.000]   of the unconscious.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.160]   And in that series, he talks about these so-called cupboards
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.120]   that we can look into in order to better understand
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.820]   our unconscious mind in order to allow our unconscious mind
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.780]   to teach us things about ourselves that are useful.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.000]   And there are three main places where our unconscious
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.700]   teaches us useful things that allow us to be more conscious
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.300]   of the way that our brain is working in useful ways.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.700]   The first is in these liminal states
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.080]   between waking and sleep.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.780]   It really does seem to be the case that when,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.460]   surprise, surprise, we're completely still,
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.540]   and we're emerging from or we're dropping into states
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.180]   of reduced autonomic arousal, but our level of thought,
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.020]   if you will, is still active enough that we are aware,
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.900]   maybe even lucid dreams, and also in dreams,
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.140]   our unconscious mind uses, as I think Jung and Freud
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.760]   pretty well understood, symbols to teach us things,
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.220]   but everything's flipped in there.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.140]   Gender's flipped, like just 'cause you're having a conflict
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.140]   with somebody in your life who's a man doesn't mean
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.420]   that that person shows up as a man.
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.980]   They could show up as an animal, so species are flipped.
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.460]   The symbols become mish-mashed, but Paul made it very clear
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.540]   that all this can be parsed if you do a certain kind
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.020]   of introspective work, and I thought that would mean
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.980]   a lot of talk therapy that people would,
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.000]   how are we gonna get people to learn how to do talk therapy
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.660]   by themselves, we wanna keep things as much independent
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.900]   of cost and things like that, and the practices
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.780]   he started talking about were incredibly simple.
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.980]   Things like mirror work, some of the psychologists
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.580]   in the room will be familiar with this.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.300]   I thought, mirror work, what is that?
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.560]   And he said literally, people trying to activate
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.420]   their unconscious, or excuse me, access their unconscious
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.860]   in sleep by a practice of staring into the mirror
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.560]   for some period of time while awake and reflecting on self
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.400]   and aspirations and the idea of the body as a container,
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.940]   all this stuff, even for a kid from Northern California,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.940]   sound really woo new agey, but here it's scripted by Paul
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.480]   into a formal structure that one can use to parse
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.300]   your own mental health and enhance mental health.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.400]   So that was the reason for doing the series,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.200]   and especially the episode on relationships,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.080]   not just romantic relationships, I found hasn't come out yet
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.980]   incredibly interesting because he talked about how
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.540]   in his clinical experience, virtually all the stuff
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.040]   that people pay attention to in relational stuff
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.640]   is are they a narcissist, are they obsessive,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.420]   is this person a musician versus whether or not
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.460]   I'm an accountant, are we compatible,
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.340]   that none of that stuff predicts anything
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.180]   as well as the balance of these three drives,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.940]   the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.040]   and the so-called generative drive.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.920]   And I found it to be fascinating and I'm excited
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.540]   for that episode and the other episodes to come out,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.020]   but basically 'cause Paul's brilliant and he makes the,
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.120]   what I consider pretty obscure and opaque,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.960]   very clear and concrete, and there are a bunch
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.260]   of worksheets, again, all available at zero cost,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.020]   and none of them requiring that you do therapy
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.700]   with anybody if you choose not to.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.840]   This is all the kind of work one could do on oneself.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.060]   And the last thing I'll say about this is,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.180]   and I should have said this first,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.460]   is that the primary motivation was we did a series
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.740]   with Dr. Andy Galpin on physical fitness,
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.540]   why isn't there a series on mental fitness, right?
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.480]   Like, what is that?
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.900]   Why do we talk so much about mental health when we're,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.020]   and it's usually a conversation about mental illness,
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.020]   what people should have tools and practices
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.600]   that are zero cost, I believe, to be able to introspect
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.460]   in a structured way and enhance their mental health
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.300]   independent of their level of income.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.840]   And I think Paul was the guy to do it,
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.200]   and we'll do more of that with other people as well,
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.180]   because no single episode about any topic or series
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.740]   can exhaustively cover any topic,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.860]   although Lord knows we will try.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.180]   Okay, next question.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.060]   What are the recommended protocols and best practices
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.220]   to enhance emotional resilience and develop effective
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.020]   responses during highly triggering situations?
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.000]   You're asking the wrong guy.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.520]   Yeah, I mean, I don't snap, I don't snap.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.840]   I was a wild teenager, but I don't snap.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.240]   I'm not the aggressor, but I do have a snap button,
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.660]   and it's been pushed before.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.380]   And I have to say, when that happens,
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.940]   it's really kind of a scary thing, not to me, right?
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.980]   And it's been many years,
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.060]   but I think anyone who's hit that threshold
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.780]   where you just try not to say something, you say it anyway,
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.660]   you know, that's usually how it shows up for people.
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.580]   I think we hear the statements like be responsive,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.840]   not reactive, okay?
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.880]   That's why I became a biologist,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.940]   'cause stuff like that makes no sense to me.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.040]   In that moment, how are you responsive, not reactive?
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.080]   So to me, it was like, what are the tools?
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.040]   Clearly, as you go up that continuum of autonomic arousal,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.380]   it becomes much harder to do whatever that means, right?
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.900]   So that hence the tools for reducing stress in real time.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.360]   I think the one that we haven't emphasized so much
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.400]   on the podcast, and by the way,
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   thanks to some great therapy that was not voluntary,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.800]   I was able to, you know, I was a wild kid,
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.300]   a wild, wild kid, hung around with wild kids,
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.320]   and things were pretty different then,
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.360]   and we worked it out, you know?
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.720]   But I think nowadays it's wonderful
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   because I think people are more conscious
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.800]   of the need to understand their nervous system,
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.780]   their own psychology.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.440]   That wasn't as common back then.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.120]   In fact, I hid the fact that I had to do therapy
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.720]   for a long time, thinking, wow,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.040]   like everyone's gonna think I'm crazy.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.460]   They did call me crazy.
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.940]   You know, I think things have really changed.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.540]   I think the last 20 years have brought about
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.200]   a profound shift in the way that we think
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.400]   about our own species and what are useful tools
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.380]   and practices, and I think that one of the things
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   that is abundantly clear is that that threshold
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.500]   for a stress response really is different
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.380]   for different people, different in different situations,
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.500]   but that it is something that can be practiced
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.140]   and elevated, and in terms of not getting near
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.260]   that trigger point through the types of practices
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.100]   I talked about earlier, getting more comfortable
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.420]   with adrenaline circulating in your system
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.540]   is what it's really about, frankly.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.960]   But of course it all starts with a good night's sleep,
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.140]   right, it's gonna make you far less reactive,
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.580]   but of course when you're stressed,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.840]   that's often when you're not getting good sleep.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.200]   So I think that ultimately that our ability
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   to, as you know, more emotional resilience
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.880]   and effective responses during triggering situations
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.340]   is really the consequence of practices
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.480]   of taking good care outside of those situations.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.500]   And then of course inevitably there will be situations
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.320]   where people get triggered, and it's actually interesting
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.980]   to see the way that people behave online
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.000]   and the fact that many people, in fact in science as well,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.600]   have literally lost their jobs for not being able
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.260]   to control their thumbs.
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.780]   It's kind of, we're in an odd time
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.820]   where there's the distancing of doing things online
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.120]   as opposed to in person where people somehow engage
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.800]   in saying things and doing things
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.300]   that they wouldn't in person.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.780]   But I think that ultimately it's the consequence
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.700]   of good self-care, and this gets actually back
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.700]   to some of the things that are covered in the Conti series.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.460]   You know, we hear about self-care as we think
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.920]   that means massages, which are great by the way,
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.140]   and we think that that is about exercise
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.980]   and that's wonderful.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.440]   But much of self-care is about really making sure
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.860]   that our nervous system is in the state
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.940]   that we need it to be in in order to go about our day.
[00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.700]   And I think this is why morning routines
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.620]   and practices are so vital.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.160]   I think that those set the stage
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.380]   for the emotional resilience.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.900]   Those set the stage for avoiding getting triggered,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.740]   so to speak.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.580]   I don't think there's a lot that one can do in real time
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.100]   except perhaps physiological size.
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.120]   So sorry to give you a sort of empty answer.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.500]   I'm not a pessimist on this front,
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.120]   but I think that ultimately it's like saying,
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.220]   well, what if you have to scale the side of a building
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.700]   to get in and you locked yourself out?
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.000]   You know, what can you do to prepare for that?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.760]   Well, you can buy a ladder, but if you don't have a ladder,
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.280]   you know, what you probably should do
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.800]   is be physically fit enough to climb up a railing
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.620]   or something like that and know how to pick a lock
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.460]   or something like that.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.420]   So I think ultimately that it's the consequence
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.480]   of stuff that's done away from those triggering situations.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.760]   Next question, please.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.460]   How would you describe the brain activity of somebody
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.620]   when they're suddenly inspired
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.360]   and hadn't foster inspiration in your life?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.040]   Well, I talked a little bit about this,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.960]   but I will say that the best way to foster inspiration
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.340]   is in the words of the great Joe Strummer.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.860]   They actually call it Strummer's law, no joke.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.920]   No input, no output.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.960]   I think one of the things that I've observed
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.600]   over and over again is that as much as we need
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.840]   to dedicate ourselves to our craft, to our families,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.380]   to our friends, that ultimately our best ideas
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.960]   come from disparate experiences
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.440]   when we're not seeking a particular kind of input
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.920]   to get ideas.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.600]   Now, maybe this practice of being completely still
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.040]   while being alert fosters a lot of,
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.420]   I think the way I understand it is more of a geysering up
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.760]   of stored information in the unconscious.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.960]   That's how I think Rick would talk about it
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.680]   or Paul Conte would talk about it
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.640]   is geysering up from the unconscious
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.620]   because when we are focused on the outside world,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.000]   we're taking in sensory information,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.280]   exteroception as opposed to interoception.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   And of course that external sensory information
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.680]   that no input, no output is that those are the raw materials
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.160]   that our nervous system uses to construct ideas
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.800]   about anything.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.560]   So my belief, and this is a practice I do every week
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   is I make sure that at least once a week,
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.440]   I either walk or hike or run without any earphones.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.880]   And I'm trying to get into states of wordlessness,
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.160]   states where I'm not digesting a podcast,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.240]   where I'm not reading a book,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.620]   where I'm not listening to a lecture,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.460]   where I'm not in conversation,
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.280]   and essentially trying to turn off
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.160]   the linguistic narrative.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.380]   We are a storytelling species.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.000]   We tend to take all of our internal and external experience
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.560]   and construct things around language,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.340]   but spoken language is not the language
[00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.140]   of the nervous system.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.700]   The language of the nervous system
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.120]   still remains to be identified.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.160]   It's something else.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.620]   For people that think in feels,
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.200]   it will certainly incorporate that.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.580]   Spoken language, of course, is important.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.160]   And we have some core structures to spoken language.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.860]   We covered this in the podcast episode
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.700]   with my friend Eddie Chang.
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.700]   But ultimately, the way to come up with new ideas
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.200]   of inspiration is going to be
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.040]   to collect the raw materials of experience
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.320]   and then give ourselves these periods,
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.700]   maybe even just five, 10 minutes.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.120]   You have to lay around half the day
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.360]   doing nothing still, wide awake,
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.780]   and give those raw materials the opportunity
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.140]   to marinate and combine in whatever ways
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.440]   that are unique to you and then to geyser up.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.600]   What inspiration looks like in the brain,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.800]   we don't really know.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.240]   There's awe.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.980]   There's some studies about awe.
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.840]   But that's different.
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.360]   The word that better comes to mind is delight.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.120]   Awe, in my mind, is something that we witness
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.720]   that sort of overwhelms our attention.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.560]   Like, wow.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.480]   Delight is when it somehow links up
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.400]   with our own internal narrative.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.000]   I have something to do with what's happening.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I'm not just here to witness it.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.120]   Fireworks show, a really impressive fireworks show,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.520]   is like awe.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.120]   But there's nothing to do about it.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.440]   It doesn't relate to anything about you, really.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.900]   You're purely a spectator.
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.660]   Whereas delight is when you see something
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.140]   and it somehow links to something in your emotional
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.960]   or personal history or how you're wired,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.740]   that now there's something to do about it.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.360]   That's inspiration.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.440]   And we don't understand where that exists in the brain
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.720]   or what that looks like.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.200]   But I think we all recognize that feeling when it happens,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.380]   and it's oh so wonderful.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.840]   Okay, next question, please.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.120]   How can Canadians fight the seasonal depression?
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.440]   Winters are too long here, okay.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   Okay, well, this gives me an opportunity to share with you
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.280]   what I think is one of the coolest things about our species.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.120]   Notice I say that about many things.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.560]   So we've talked about circadian rhythms, right?
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.440]   Sunrises, sunsets.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.800]   And we get that information transmitted
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.920]   into our nervous system by looking at the sunrise.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.320]   By the way, you don't have to watch the sun
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.720]   cross the horizon.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.080]   It just needs to be low solar angle, low in the sky.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.520]   Once it's overhead, it's a different signal.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.180]   So low solar angle, that's what it's about.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.000]   It's not necessarily about seeing the sun
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.160]   cross the horizon.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.040]   By the way, someone the other day on my team said,
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.400]   "Wait, won't you get cataracts if you look at the sun?"
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.360]   Low solar angle sunlight is very unlikely to cause cataracts
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.340]   especially if you're just doing it 10 to 30 minutes.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.600]   That solar, the sun overhead is when it's quite bright.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.360]   Yes, indeed, some people are going to be
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.320]   at risk for cataracts.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.460]   So ophthalmologists in the audience
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.420]   can attack me for that one.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.120]   But it was our chair of ophthalmology at Stanford
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.000]   that said it, so I'm going to trust him.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.840]   Okay.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.040]   That's circadian 24 hour rhythms,
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.200]   but there's also these circannual rhythms.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.900]   So if you're at a fairly Northern location on the planet,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.800]   nights get very long, days get short in winter.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.660]   What happens then?
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.800]   Well, melatonin, the hormone of darkness, right?
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.320]   Is essentially obliterated by light, by sunlight.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   So what's happening when days are 12 hours long,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.400]   you have very little melatonin,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.100]   the duration of the melatonin signal is very short.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.920]   Then as you proceed into the fall,
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.640]   days are getting shorter, nights are getting longer,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.040]   the duration of the melatonin signal
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.240]   is getting longer and longer.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.140]   Then is, of course, in winter, there's a lot more darkness,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.480]   melatonin signals are very long,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.320]   daylight signals are very short because the days are short.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   So you can say, okay, well, that's obvious, thank goodness.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.440]   But what that means is incredible.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.600]   What that means is that you have a hormone, melatonin,
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.280]   that's secreted from your pineal gland,
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.200]   which Descartes called the seed of the soul,
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   'cause there's only one of them in the brain.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.720]   I don't know how he came up with that one,
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.440]   but the pineal secretes melatonin
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.480]   and you suppress melatonin secretion with sunlight viewing.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.360]   There's a couple of synapses in between the eye
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.800]   and the pineal, but it gets there up through the neck,
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.200]   basically cervical ganglion.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.440]   What's wild, therefore, is that the location of the earth
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   around the sun and the tilt of the earth is translated
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.260]   into a neural and then a hormonal signal in your brain,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.760]   which to me is amazing.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.880]   That literally means that the position of the earth
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.060]   around the sun and its tilt are translated
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.200]   into a physiological signal that's working unconsciously
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.720]   to tell your brain and body what time of year it is,
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.120]   but it doesn't care what time of year it is.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.320]   It cares about where you are in this orbit about the sun.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   So if you think about when days are, say, eight hours long
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.400]   in the fall versus eight hours long in the spring,
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.920]   what's different?
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.720]   What's different is how long the signal was the day before.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.480]   So the seasonal depression we now know
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.040]   is the consequence of the melatonin signal getting longer,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.460]   not an absolute duration of the melatonin signal.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.460]   In other words, in the spring when a day is eight hours long
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:20.660]   but yesterday the day was seven hours and 48 minutes long,
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.240]   your brain has a memory of how much melatonin
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.240]   was released the day before, much more,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   than that particular day.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.360]   So it's a slow integrating clock.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.280]   So this is a very roundabout way for me to teach you
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.020]   about the melatonin seasonal rhythm cycle
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.320]   and answer the question directly by saying,
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.360]   if you want to offset seasonal depression,
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   what you want to do is extend the amount of bright light
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.480]   that you're getting in the morning slightly
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.420]   as days get shorter.
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.800]   But it's the extension of the bright light exposure.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.080]   And if you can't do that with sunlight
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   'cause there's no sunlight 'cause you live in Toronto,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.320]   not Toronto, what you want to do
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   is find some artificial source that you can look at
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.760]   in the morning before you leave your home.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.860]   And I haven't talked much about this on the podcast
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.000]   because our listeners are extended around the globe
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.460]   and not just in northern locations.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.640]   But what this essentially means is getting
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.880]   maybe two to three minutes of bright light exposure
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.280]   as you're heading from fall into winter,
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.720]   bright light from an artificial source.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.520]   You do not need to purchase a so-called sad lamp,
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.940]   one of these very expensive seasonal effect depression lamps.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.400]   What I did was I purchased,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.700]   'cause I'm very sensitive to seasonal changes in light,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.740]   even though I don't live very far north,
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.880]   is you can get a 900 lux drawing tablet.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.480]   These are quite inexpensive.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.520]   They're not zero cost, but quite inexpensive.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.880]   And just put that on your desk
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.020]   or wherever you make your coffee in the morning,
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.080]   90 minutes after you wake up, this sort of thing,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.320]   and just get five or so minutes before you leave the house.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.360]   And then as you extend into the winter,
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.400]   you don't have to be neurotic
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.760]   about increasing the duration every day.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.880]   You could actually,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.960]   the way these slow integrating clocks work,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.200]   you could actually even just hold it
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.600]   a little bit closer each day.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.700]   Don't burn your eyeballs out a little bit closer each day.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.600]   But essentially if you just dose yourself
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.960]   with a little bit more bright light early in the day
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.920]   as you extend into winter,
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.540]   that will essentially trick the melatonin system
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.120]   into thinking that you're going from eight hours
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.400]   into 10 hours of light,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.760]   as opposed to eight hours into six hours of light, okay?
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.740]   Very simple.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.240]   And if you can't get one of these 900 lux tablets
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.100]   or something off a website,
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.440]   then you could do this with any bright incandescent bulb
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.560]   should work.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.040]   Again, just be careful not to put it directly
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.120]   against your eyeball.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.720]   Okay, next question, please.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.860]   How do you increase neuroplasticity?
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.660]   Well, this is an opportunity to talk about something
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.540]   I should have said earlier,
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.840]   which is that ultimately whether or not
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.320]   you are triggering neuroplasticity through elevated focus
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.220]   or whether or not you're taking high dose psilocybin,
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.000]   your business, not mine,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   and we could talk about psychedelics if you want,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.320]   just decriminalized in California
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.220]   or soon to be decriminalized.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.760]   Cool, people are enthusiastic.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.720]   Yeah, the one thing that,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.760]   I've been pretty vocal about my belief
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.680]   that the data are really interesting to say the least
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.480]   about not microdosing.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.320]   By the way, there's not a lot of evidence
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.560]   that microdosing is useful.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.580]   I'm not saying it's not,
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.260]   but there are not a lot of clinical trials showing that,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.740]   but the two macro dose with effective therapeutic support
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.840]   trials are very encouraging,
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.380]   not just for major depression,
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.720]   but also for various eating disorders,
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.500]   alcohol use disorder,
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.340]   which is by the way,
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.440]   the term that people are starting to shift to
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.640]   as opposed to alcoholism or alcoholic
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.140]   that's not alcohol use disorder,
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.600]   which is not to be politically correct,
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.760]   or just so you understand what they're talking about
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.000]   when they're talking about alcohol use disorder.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Whether or not psilocybin,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.060]   whether or not it's MDMA,
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.440]   whether or not it's frustration brought about
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.040]   by your inability to play an instrument
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.640]   and your determination to do so,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.480]   it's in the end,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.360]   it's all about deployment of these neuromodulators.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.880]   Neuromodulators being some combination of dopamine,
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.080]   serotonin, acetylcholine or epinephrine,
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.000]   again, usually in combination.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.340]   What's very clear is that the neuroplastic effects of MDMA,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.800]   the neuroplastic effects of psilocybin
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.960]   are brought about by huge increases in serotonin.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.920]   This is also can help us understand why for some years,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.520]   and to some extent still now,
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.840]   it was thought that the SSRIs,
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.700]   the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.560]   would be good treatments for depression.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.900]   I think some people by the way,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.620]   have experienced tremendous relief from the SSRIs.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.780]   We don't want to demonize them.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.620]   At the same time,
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.700]   it's very clear that depression
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.140]   is not simply low levels of serotonin.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.920]   That's also not true.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.240]   Hence why there's effective in some people,
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   antidepressants like bupren that increase dopamine
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.000]   and epinephrine and not serotonin.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.660]   The point here is that these neuromodulators,
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.780]   as they're called, allow for what?
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.860]   They allow for modulation of synapses,
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.320]   which effectively allows for neuroplasticity.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.600]   I mean, ultimately, whether or not it's through talk therapy,
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   Kundalini breathing, high-dose psilocybin, MDMA,
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.980]   or the combination, which I think is called a hippie flip.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.080]   Never done them together.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.880]   I confess, never done them together.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.360]   But have done them.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.320]   With a clinician, by the way,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.300]   in legal circumstances, and not a lot,
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.240]   not often, that is,
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.900]   it's very clear that it's opening windows for plasticity.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:48.940]   Now, what's intriguing,
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.280]   if we're gonna just talk about psychedelics for a second,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.340]   is why a drug like MDMA, which increases dopamine,
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.380]   which, by the way, MDMA is methylenedioxymethamphetamine.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.220]   Don't let anybody tell you it's something there.
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.800]   It's meth.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   It's meth.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.140]   But it's meth with a lot of serotonin thrown in there, too.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.460]   But it's meth.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.060]   And it's clear that for the treatment of PTSD,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.200]   it holds promise.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.340]   It's not absolutely safe,
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.400]   especially for people with cardiac conditions.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.660]   And if you're gonna go down that path,
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.160]   you want and need a skilled guide.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.280]   And this is where I think the laws
[00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.840]   are really gonna have to pay careful attention
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.000]   to who and what is a skilled guide.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.720]   And when it comes to psilocybin,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.700]   the serotonin increase is what effectively causes
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.480]   broader connectivity in the brain.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.980]   And what's interesting is that both of those drugs
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.520]   increase plasticity, mainly through increases in serotonin,
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.680]   but working on very different receptors.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.040]   So they have different types and outputs of plasticity.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.060]   What's interesting to me is that,
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.160]   because I'm a strong believer
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.840]   that children should not be doing psychedelics,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.520]   nor should we be giving children psychedelics,
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.360]   is that the increases in connectivity in the brain
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.940]   that are the consequence of playing a musical instrument,
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:06.080]   or ideally an instrument with others as a child,
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.040]   mimic a lot of the broader scale connectivity,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.960]   so-called resting network connectivity,
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.180]   that occurs when people take psychedelics as adults.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.520]   In other words, and I can't emphasize this enough,
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.660]   and again, I failed at music, miserably.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.340]   I'll tell you a story about that in a second.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:25.340]   But getting kids to play an instrument,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.880]   it's very clear improves their ability
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.980]   to learn all sorts of things for their entire life.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.580]   It's just so, so important.
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.200]   I don't really know what to do about this,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.640]   or who to shout out or talk to
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.600]   about keeping the arts active in schools,
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.120]   and physical education,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.240]   but the idea that we would just train kids in math
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.440]   is just frightening,
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.940]   because if you want them to be truly good
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:50.060]   at math and science, you'd also have them play instruments.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:52.460]   By the way, when I was a kid, I played the violin.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.440]   My parents made me.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.280]   It was not the instrument I wanted to play,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.220]   and we have only one picture,
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.340]   and they taught me the Suzuki method.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.420]   You're supposed to learn by ear,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.780]   and there's one picture,
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.580]   and all the other kids have their bows up,
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.020]   and my bow is down,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.300]   and I'm standing here on the stage,
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.840]   and my fly is down.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.200]   And that, and literally the neighbor's dog howled,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.040]   and I quit after that concert.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.900]   So I was traumatized,
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.900]   but they showed me the picture.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.980]   My sister teased me relentlessly.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.540]   So neuroplasticity, figure out your choice way
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.660]   to increase a neuromodulator,
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.980]   like serotonin or epinephrine, acetylcholine, or dopamine.
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:34.540]   I honestly would not encourage pharmacologic
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.180]   or psychedelic approaches as your primary entry point.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.060]   I really don't.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.240]   I think that there's a place for that
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.340]   in certain circumstances,
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.700]   but that would not be the primary entry point.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.100]   Next question, please.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.660]   What type of movement protocol do you recommend
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.580]   for somebody who's working from home,
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.620]   sitting behind the computer from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.?
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.460]   Oh, okay, well, couple things.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.860]   I mean, I can make all sorts of recommendations
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.060]   like get up early and move,
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.340]   if you can take breaks and walk, this sort of thing.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.120]   But let's assume that all of that is kind of understood,
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.580]   that there are certain forms of exercise
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.040]   that we should all be doing.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.220]   I think now it's very clear,
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.380]   based on the beautiful work of Peter Attia,
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.760]   whose brother is in the audience, by the way, tonight.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.180]   Yeah, yeah. (audience cheering)
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.180]   He's got a younger brother.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.180]   He's got a younger brother.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.820]   Can you imagine if Peter Attia was your older brother?
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.140]   Imagine.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.140]   It'd be pretty cool.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.300]   I sort of adopt people as siblings,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.500]   'cause they don't know it, but I do.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.740]   But I just assume Peter was my older brother,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.620]   but turns out he has a younger brother already.
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.180]   And Peter's essentially hammered home the truth,
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.540]   which is that we should all be getting
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.500]   somewhere between 150 and 200 minutes
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.260]   of so-called zone two cardio,
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.780]   where we're walking a lot and we're moving about,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.260]   where we can just barely hold a conversation.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.820]   I notice people in Toronto seem to walk a lot,
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.660]   so that's great.
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:56.660]   And then three days a week or so of resistance training,
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.260]   and there are a bunch of other mobility things
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.560]   that we should all do so that we don't fall
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.980]   and break our hips, 'cause that's, we're another bone,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.980]   'cause that's another way that people really limit
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.380]   their health spin and lifespan, and so on and so forth.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.900]   But two things that can make being at a desk,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.740]   which I loathe, even though I like to learn,
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.780]   I hate sitting still, you can do the standing desk thing.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.620]   I do that by stacking boxes.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.140]   The other thing that was interesting,
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.860]   did anyone see this study out of the University of Texas?
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.820]   I think it was in Houston this last year
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.460]   about the soleus push-up.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.480]   Did anyone see this?
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.060]   This is pretty interesting.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.320]   So the soleus, this wider, flat muscle
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.420]   below the gastrocnemius of the calf
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.360]   is a really unique muscle in the human body.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.640]   It's 1% of the total human musculature,
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.860]   but it has an ability,
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.200]   what we'll assume to be for obvious reasons,
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.740]   to dramatically shift fuel utilization in the body.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.100]   What they did in this study was they had people
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.720]   who were sitting for three or four hours a day
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.180]   just simply raise their heel.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.180]   Seems almost silly, right?
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.760]   They call it a soleus push-up.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.940]   When I called it that online,
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.460]   I literally got attacked by the gym bros
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.080]   telling me that's a seated calf raise.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.180]   Okay, you know, I mean, like, okay.
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.640]   No wonder they, you know, this whole bro science thing
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.820]   gets kind of, you know, people get really aggressive.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.540]   They lift their heel and they're pushing their toe down.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.420]   And some people think of it as bouncing the knee,
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.920]   but it's really about pushing the toe down
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.760]   and lifting the heel.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.300]   So they just simply had these sedentary people
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.340]   do this heel raise.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.100]   And what they saw was that there was a dramatic,
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.540]   highly statistically significant increase
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.060]   in blood glucose utilization and reduction
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.220]   in both insulin levels during that activity
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.380]   and around the clock.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:39.300]   Really interesting.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   What they were doing was mimicking some aspect of walking.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.180]   Now, is it as good as walking?
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.680]   No, but if you are stuck behind a, you know,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.260]   working from home, sitting behind the computer
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.420]   from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., what they found
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.920]   was that people getting into this unconscious pattern
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.240]   of lifting their heel over and over
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.060]   and shifting back and forth mimicked a lot of the effects
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.240]   of walking, it's not a replacement for exercise,
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.100]   but the shifts in glucose and insulin output
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.820]   and utilization, excuse me, utilization and output
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.780]   respectively were very impressive.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.660]   And this group down at the University of Texas in Houston
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.840]   is starting to incorporate this into people
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.440]   who have limited mobility.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.520]   And it doesn't seem like other limb movements can do this.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.220]   There's something special about the soleus.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   It was designed, in air quotes, to be a muscle
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:33.020]   that's used repeatedly over extended hours of time
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.720]   and that has this unique pathway of fuel utilization.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.440]   So is it going to cure obesity?
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.740]   No, but if you're stuck behind a desk,
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.060]   that would be something useful.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.160]   I have this little fidget thing.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.020]   I was too lazy to build one, but I found one online
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.060]   for a couple bucks where you just, when you stand
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.580]   at your desk, you just kind of kick it back and forth.
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:50.540]   Anyone seen these?
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   They're kind of cool.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.020]   Then you just kind of kick them back and forth
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.560]   and some people will treadmill at the desk.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.300]   I can't do that, I can't do that many things,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.540]   but I also am still like working on this one.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.620]   I can't quite do that.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:02.180]   Next question, please.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.500]   My morning meditation consists of, okay,
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.940]   and then I think we're about out of time,
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.440]   but the, yeah, so my morning meditation
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.560]   is not really a meditation, it's a perceptual exercise.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.560]   And that perceptual exercise has a weird name
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.400]   'cause I gave it a weird name.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.460]   And I didn't intend to sound mystical
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.000]   and I don't want credit for it,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.420]   but I call it space time bridging, but it's not that.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.680]   What it really is is to me, one of the most interesting
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.520]   things about the nervous system is our ability
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.640]   to orient in different time domains.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.360]   This gets a little bit abstract,
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.280]   but we know from states of high stress
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.680]   that we start fine slicing time, we know this.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.520]   The world becomes like a slow motion video
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.640]   because frame rate has increased.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.120]   As a vision neuroscientist, I can tell you
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.840]   that in my laboratory, we were doing studies
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.540]   with virtual reality where we can crank up
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.060]   people's level of stress by giving them
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.240]   certain visual stimuli and then their ability
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.080]   to parse information is clearly increasing
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.180]   in the time domain, their fine slicing,
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.320]   much in the same way that when you look
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.840]   at a slow motion video, somebody dunking a basketball
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   or something of that sort is because
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.300]   the frame rate went up, right?
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.540]   So when we are in high alertness states,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.840]   our frame rate increases.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.180]   When we're very relaxed, our frame rate decreases.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:19.220]   So if you're Rick Rubin-ing and you're lying there
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.180]   looking at the sky, your frame rate is probably slower
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.280]   than if you're hyper focused on oh my goodness,
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.000]   like you said, imagine a dreadful situation
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.520]   where somebody sends you a text message.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.740]   Well, let's make it positive.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.500]   Somebody's having a child in your family
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.660]   and you're like, is it a healthy, are mom and baby okay?
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.100]   Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.140]   I mean, seconds feel like minutes.
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:44.660]   Minutes feel like hours because you're fine slicing time.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.780]   Okay, and then dah, dah, dah, mom and baby are fine.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.020]   Okay, great, happy story ending.
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.140]   Great, so when we're very relaxed,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.220]   we tend to bin time more broadly.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.940]   Now, it's also true that your visual system
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.800]   and your perception of time are inextricably linked
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.300]   such that if you close your eyes and you focused
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   on your internal state, you are fine slicing time
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.860]   and the second hand, if you will, is more or less
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.140]   the metronome rather is your breathing
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.660]   and your heart rate combined.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.580]   When you open your eyes and you look at something
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.300]   in your immediate environment, when you move
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.900]   from so-called interoception to exteroception,
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.100]   you start, your perception of time shifts
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.620]   fairly dramatically and you now perceive time
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.740]   according to, believe it or not, the speed of images
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.220]   moving in your environment relative to you
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.700]   and then as you look out further onto, say, the horizon,
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.740]   you extend the time domain even more.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.060]   If you then imagine yourself kind of in the whole globe,
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.500]   you extend your time domain even more.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   So my morning meditation, if you will,
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.060]   it's more of a perceptual exercise,
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.260]   is to step through these different time domains
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.620]   to close my eyes and focus on my internal state,
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.620]   open my eyes and focus on something close by,
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.740]   look a little bit further, look a bit further,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.740]   think about myself on the globe, the whole world moving,
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.540]   so you're really extending your space domain
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.420]   and then the time domain expands with it.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.260]   And this comes up when you see these little memes
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.340]   of anytime you're worried, just remember,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.380]   you're a little dot on a little blue dot
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.060]   spinning in the universe, this kind of thing,
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.100]   but you don't think that way when you're stressed.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:25.300]   You're thinking, I'm the blue dot, you're the problem,
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.940]   whatever, I want that, you're not thinking.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.180]   So this perceptual exercise is a way
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.880]   of training the nervous system, my nervous system,
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.900]   to shift deliberately between these different time domains.
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:37.900]   And for me, it's been very useful
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.220]   for improving task switching,
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.220]   something that, as you probably have noticed,
[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.500]   I'm not very good at.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.740]   I go into the trench, I don't leave the trench very easily.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.300]   So that's been very useful.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.600]   And if you are interested in this in more detail,
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.660]   there's a wonderful book called
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.780]   "The Secret Pulse of Time."
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.720]   And there's a Hitchcock movie that's discussed in that book,
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.700]   which the movie is about 75 minutes long.
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.240]   And during the course of that movie,
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.600]   the background actually includes rising
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.180]   and setting of the sun and a bunch of different speeds
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.500]   of movement and interplay between the characters.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.420]   And your perception at the end of the movie
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.780]   is that a much, much longer period of time occurred
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.860]   because of, unconsciously, your brain was paying attention
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.220]   to these circadian signals and these other signals
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.340]   and absolutely fascinating.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.260]   I'm in Hitchcock, not a huge Hitchcock fan,
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.300]   but now, after seeing that, I was like, wow, that's genius.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.620]   He captured this space-time thing.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.900]   What you see out the window is in one time domain.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.620]   In the room is a different time domain.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.300]   I won't tell you who killed who.
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:42.680]   But it's very, very interesting.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.160]   And so the point being that when your visual system
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.060]   is up close, focusing on things up close or internally,
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.460]   you're fine slicing.
[00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.860]   When you focus on things further away,
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.840]   you're more broadly focusing and so on and so forth.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.740]   So that's a morning meditation I do.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.060]   Perceptual exercise only takes about a minute or so.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.780]   And the other thing is that on the monitors,
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:03.680]   they're flashing now.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.200]   That was your last question.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.020]   So I wanna just say a couple of things before we go.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.620]   First of all, thanks to all of you who stood out the night
[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:12.460]   for the long duration.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.520]   I realize this stuff is nerdy, detailed,
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.760]   and there are a lot of other things you could be doing
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.580]   with your evening and your time.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.240]   And so I'm very grateful that you all came together tonight
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.180]   for this, what I like to think was a discussion.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.220]   And I also just wanna thank everyone
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.820]   for your interest in the podcast.
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.980]   You know, it is a labor of love.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.420]   I'm highly dependent on my team for doing all of it.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.500]   I don't do it alone by any stretch.
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.820]   But as much as it might seem like it's me
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.460]   talking to all of you, it really is about all of you.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.020]   That's the reason I do it and I'm ever so grateful.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.780]   And I'd certainly be remiss if I didn't say
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.480]   thank you for your interest in science.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.640]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   (audience cheering)
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.800]   Thank you.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.120]   (upbeat music)
