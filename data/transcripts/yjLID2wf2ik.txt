[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.120]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.440]   We talked about entertainment on Friday,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.960]   about how much entertainment is too much entertainment.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.920]   And today we push the conversation forward
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.240]   a little bit further.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.440]   What if entertainment has become an addiction?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.400]   How do we get unstuck?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.960]   Here's the email for today.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.440]   Hello, Pastor John, my name is Cesar,
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.960]   and I am writing to you from Peru.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.800]   I thank the Lord for the blessing
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.740]   that is your ministry to me.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.680]   In the past three weeks,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.800]   I've been disturbed by the following situation.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.000]   I cannot break my addiction to entertainment.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.120]   I'm convinced that the short-lived emotions
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.660]   of entertainment do not compare
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.540]   to the pleasures found in a deep life of communion with God.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.000]   But I can play a video game for three hours
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.600]   and feel my emptiness and dissatisfaction as a result.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.480]   But the next day, my desire for more entertainment
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.200]   is renewed and this has turned
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.520]   into a horrible, vicious cycle.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.320]   I'm very stressed with this situation.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.280]   I wanna grow spiritually.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.240]   I do not wanna waste my life in trifles.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.760]   Pastor John, what would you say to Cesar?
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   - As I prayed for Cesar and what I might say to him,
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   what seemed good to do is to take three of his statements
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.480]   and show how they're not accurate.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.880]   Give me space here, give me time now.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.480]   This is gonna sound a little blunt
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.840]   and how one of them points a way forward.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.800]   Number one, he says,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.520]   "I cannot break my addiction for entertainment."
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.480]   No, Cesar, that's not true.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.360]   You can stop playing these games three hours a day,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.760]   wasting your time.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.500]   By labeling this habit an addiction,
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.680]   you might be giving yourself a partial pass.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.920]   Whatever you think addiction means,
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   it's probably not what you think it is.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.560]   When you waste three hours of your precious life
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.620]   playing a video game over and over,
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.120]   this is not something you can't stop doing.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.420]   Let me illustrate.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.480]   If a man walked up to you while you were playing
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.000]   a video game and lit a blowtorch and said,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   "If you don't stop playing this video game,
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.360]   I will burn your eyeballs out with this blowtorch,"
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.480]   you'd stop, period, blunt, done.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.600]   Of course you would.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.740]   It's ludicrous to say you can't stop.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.120]   You can stop.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.280]   Or let's put it positively.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.160]   If a man walked up to you with a million dollars in cash
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.880]   and convinced you that it was his
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.440]   to give to whomever he please,
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.960]   and he offered it to you, all of it,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.240]   if you just stopped playing that game.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.080]   (laughs)
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.960]   It's just ludicrous to say you wouldn't stop.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.880]   You'd stop.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.800]   Of course you would stop, and you would stop.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.900]   You're not in bondage to that game.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.160]   You can stop.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.080]   You can walk away from it.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.280]   And I promise you, with a blowtorch in your face
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.760]   or a million dollars in your pocket,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.360]   it would be easy to walk away.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.360]   The fear of pain or the pleasure of money
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.400]   would have instantly replaced your desires for that game.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.080]   So that's my first qualification of something you said.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   Number two, Cesar, you say,
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.520]   "I am convinced that the short-lived emotions
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.440]   "of entertainment do not compare to the pleasure
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.540]   "that there is in a deep life of communion with God."
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.120]   No, Cesar, you're not convinced of this.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.740]   You say you are, but these are just words.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.840]   Jesus said, "You will know them by their fruits,"
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   Matthew 7:16.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.760]   And the essential thing he meant was,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.800]   "People say many things, feel many things,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   "think many things, but a decisive test is fruit.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.620]   "Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.360]   "or figs from thistles," he said.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.540]   So three hours on a video game, day after day,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.000]   wasting your precious life is not a fruit
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600]   of being convinced that communion with Jesus is better.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's not.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.820]   Number three, you say,
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.060]   "I can play a video game for three hours.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.620]   "Then I feel my emptiness and dissatisfaction,
[00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.120]   "but the next day, my desire for more entertainment
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360]   "is renewed."
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   Well, actually, Cesar, the word renewed is an understatement.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.800]   It's not renewed, it's re-enthroned.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.840]   It takes its place as the king of your will,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   which means that you then take your seat passively
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.040]   at its feet and you do its bidding like a slave.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.880]   That's the way Paul describes it in Romans 6:12.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   He said, "Let not sin therefore reign,"
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.200]   that is, be king, "in your mortal body
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.900]   "to make you a slave,
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.580]   "to make you obey its passions like a slave."
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.480]   Now, you may ask, I suppose other people are asking,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.420]   "Why are you being so hard on Cesar?
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.640]   "He wrote in for help, for goodness sakes.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.220]   "Don't beat him up."
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.140]   I'm not beating up Cesar.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.920]   I'm showing him that he is being beaten up
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.400]   by these two-bit pleasures called video games.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Two-bit, no-count, low-grade, wasteful video games
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.000]   are beating him up, deceiving him,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.320]   making him a lackey and a slave.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   I'm trying to give voice to Jesus' words in Matthew 5:28.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.760]   Let me just paraphrase.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.840]   You'll recognize the words.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.080]   "I say to you that everyone who is suckered in
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.640]   "by a fluttering eyelashes of a video game
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   "commits adultery with the game in his heart.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.160]   "If your right eye causes you for a video game to sin,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.900]   "tear it out, throw it away.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.320]   "For it's better for you to lose one of your members
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.180]   "than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.380]   "And if your right hand causes you
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.620]   "to be glued to a video game, cut it off.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.720]   "Put a blowtorch to it.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560]   "For it is better that you lose one of your members
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.200]   "than your whole body be thrown into hell."
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.960]   That's the way Jesus talks about blowtorches to the face.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.280]   So, Cesar, when you say,
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.360]   "I am very stressed with this situation.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.260]   "I want to grow spiritually.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.960]   "I do not want to waste my life in trifles.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.820]   "I believe you.
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.240]   "I believe you.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.880]   "There is a real battle going on in your soul
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   "as in all of our souls.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.560]   "And I rejoice that you feel stressed by this situation."
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.860]   That is a very good sign.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.600]   So here's my counsel.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.120]   Tear out your eye and cut off your hand.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.240]   Now, that is get rid of all the apps
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.320]   that suck you in and make a slave of you.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   Just tear 'em right off your phone.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.360]   You know, I mean, tearing out your eye
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.640]   surely has an application to your devices.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.120]   Say with Paul in 1 Corinthians 6, 12,
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.820]   "My body is not my own.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.200]   "I've been bought with a price, the blood of Jesus.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.700]   "I will not be enslaved to anyone else.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.680]   "He is my master."
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.560]   Then turn away from the games
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   and receive the million dollar gift from Jesus.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.820]   No, no, no, no, way understatement.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.820]   Billions, billions, and billions of dollars worth of reward
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.380]   better than anything else.
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.260]   - Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.300]   for turning our eyes from our screens
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   to the beauty of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.700]   I appreciate that.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.420]   And we are back on Wednesday
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.260]   to hear from a woman who is waiting,
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.020]   waiting for her husband to leave the home.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.300]   It's not an uncommon question.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.960]   Specifically, are wives responsible
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.220]   for changing their husbands?
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.620]   First Peter 3 seems to say yes.
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.060]   And Pastor John will give us his take on that.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.900]   That's on Wednesday.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.940]   Until then, you can find over 1,300 past episodes
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:40.780]   in our archive.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.940]   Go to our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.980]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.120]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.440]   (whooshing)
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.780]   (whooshing)
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.100]   (whooshing)
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.160]   you
