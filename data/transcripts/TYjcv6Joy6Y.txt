[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480]   We talk often on this podcast about how God gets more glory or most glory by various things.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.920]   It's in our slogan, of course.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.840]   God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.560]   Thus we can conclude that, for example, depression will not exist in heaven because we can give
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.200]   God more glory without depression.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360]   That's APJ 30.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.280]   And God gets more glory in our struggle with sin than if we were made sinless immediately.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.360]   That's APJ 30.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.200]   And God gets more glory in the harmony of diversity in male and female genders and in
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.720]   his abundance of ethnicities than he would get if we were all the same.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.600]   That's APJs 169 and 927.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.040]   And Christ receives more glory in the atonement than he would have if he didn't take up the
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040]   cross.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720]   That's APJ 265.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.800]   We talked about that.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.440]   And Christ gets more glory by defeating Satan at the cross than he would have by taking
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.280]   out Satan at a distance, like as a sniper.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.240]   That's APJ 408.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.560]   And God gets more glory from our willing service than if he forced and coerced labor from us
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   as a tireless slave labor force.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.900]   That's APJ 1432.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.280]   On and on it goes.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.640]   With this background in place, we get a question from Devin in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.640]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.600]   Thank you for this podcast and for your excellent books, particularly Providence, which I just
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.360]   read and finished with great delight.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.920]   I have a question for you about discerning our intensity of glorifying God.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.880]   It seems central to Christian hedonism, this idea that there are levels of glory that can
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.960]   be given to God.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   There's a way to bring him some glory, and then we can bring him more glory, and occasionally
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.120]   we can bring him most glory.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.600]   Hence, God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.240]   You seem to root a lot of ethical decisions in this gradation of doing what most glorifies
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   God.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.280]   I went to the podcast archive and found that you have explained that we can honor God in
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.080]   three various states of emotion.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.160]   When our affections are white hot or cooled off, even when our hearts fall into deep depression.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   But we glorify God most when our affections are white hot."
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   That was APJ 30.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.560]   You talked about that.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.120]   Where in Scripture do you find this gradation of glory from what I see in the Bible?
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.940]   We either honor God or dishonor him, glorify him or fail to honor him.
[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.760]   It seems more binary.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360]   But I assume you put a lot more thought into this than me.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.160]   Thank you for any help.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.920]   Well, that's a sharp question.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:58.120]   I like that kind of question because it presses me into the Bible to see if my thoughts are
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.520]   in sync with God's Word.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:13.480]   So the question is, is there biblical warrant justification for speaking of more or less
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.320]   glorifying God, acts that more or less glorify God, rather than a simple either/or?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.880]   Either we glorify him or we don't.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.280]   No gradations.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.840]   Does the glorification of God by man happen in degrees, glorifying more sometimes, less
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.800]   sometimes?
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:45.040]   Or is that an unbiblical way of thinking and is the only way we should speak, namely that
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.640]   we glorified God or we didn't, without speaking of degrees or gradations of glorification?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.320]   Now, Devon has a good biblical ground for asking this because if you do the word search
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:09.200]   on all kinds of formations of the word "glory" or "more" or "less" or other degree words,
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:17.880]   you do find that the Bible does not very often speak of God being given more or less glory
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.680]   by his people.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.720]   Almost entirely it speaks of God's being glorified without any references to degrees of more
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.440]   or less.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.480]   So why do I speak so often about God being more or less glorified?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.360]   And here's the answer.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.800]   So general answer and then some biblical specifics.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   It basically flows from asking, "What does glorify mean?"
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.520]   I think it means, "Show God to be glorious."
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.040]   I think that's what glorify means.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   Show God to be glorious, that is, show him to be great or beautiful or valuable.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.960]   Or you could break it down.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:14.440]   Show him to be wise, strong, kind, good, loving, just, holy, merciful, gracious, satisfying.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:25.840]   So to glorify is to make clear to others what God is like so as to seek their praise and
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.880]   admiration of him so that they join us in seeking to show how great he is.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.200]   That's what glorify means, as I understand it.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:47.360]   So once we trace the meaning of glorify back to things we do or feel or think or say to
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:57.240]   make God look glorious, then it seems right to say that since our doing and speaking and
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:06.920]   feeling and thinking are more or less in accord with God's worth from day to day, from hour
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   to hour, therefore our showing God's worth will vary in the way our acting and speaking,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.480]   feeling, and thinking vary in the degree that they reflect God's character.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.720]   That's basically my argument.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:31.120]   In other words, my speaking of God getting more or less glory from my life of holiness
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:40.560]   and love follows from the fact that biblically my holiness and love are greater or lesser
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.640]   from time to time.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:51.840]   And so I am showing with greater or less clarity or greater or less accuracy or greater or
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:07:00.480]   less fullness the glory of God because my behavior is more or less in accord with God's
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.080]   character.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.360]   That's my basic understanding of how degrees of glorification are rooted in degrees of
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   clarity that God's character is seen in my degrees of holiness.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.200]   Now let's look at some text to see whether or not there really are biblical pointers
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.080]   to the legitimacy and helpfulness of talking like this.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.840]   Let's start with degrees of glory when talking about the progress of redemptive history,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.380]   2 Corinthians 3, 7 to 10.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.360]   Now if the ministry of death carved in letters of stone came with such glory that the Israelites
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.120]   could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:53.360]   will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.320]   For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.120]   must far exceed it in glory.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:10.960]   Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all because of
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.000]   the glory that surpasses it.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.600]   So it is not unbiblical to speak of God's acting through his people in one way to show
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.280]   less of his glory and in another way to show more of his glory.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   And by inference, I would say that's true individually as well.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:43.120]   Or consider 2 Corinthians 4, 15, "For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:52.320]   to more and more people, it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God."
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:09:01.960]   Now I think that implies that if thanksgiving increases in your life or in your church,
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:10.400]   God gets glory more clearly, more fully than if thanksgiving were not increasing in your
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.920]   life or in your church.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.360]   Otherwise, I don't see why Paul would refer to the increase of thanksgiving and then connect
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.580]   it with the glory of God the way he does.
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:29.240]   Or consider Philippians 1, 9, "It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.160]   knowledge and all discernment."
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:41.240]   And then he links this incremental growth or increase of love with his aim that we be
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.520]   filled with the fruit of righteousness to the glory and praise of God.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:56.280]   So I draw from this that my growth in love from one degree to the next is like the good
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.240]   deeds, part of the good deeds or expressed in good deeds that Jesus said cause people
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.520]   to glorify God.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.240]   "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good deeds, your love, and glorify
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.400]   God."
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:21.000]   So if my love abounds more and more, it seems that the correlation of what they are done
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.360]   for, what my deeds are done for, and my love is shown for would also be greater.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:36.400]   Namely, God is seen more clearly to be glorious because I have more clearly reflected his
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   character.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.760]   Or what about Ephesians 5, 18, "Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.600]   be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.760]   songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart."
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:01.120]   Now what that implies is that the engagement of our heart matters in whether our songs
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.340]   of praise are fitting.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.920]   Jesus said, "These people honors me with their lips, they sing with their lips, but
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.760]   their heart is far from me."
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:21.840]   So it seems to me that the heart is a very variable source of affections for God.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.680]   The heart can be warm or cold or all kinds of gradations in between, and Paul says this
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:36.000]   matters for the authenticity of our worship, and I would say for the degree to which our
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.440]   worship conforms to the worth of God and thus the degree to how clearly he is shown to be
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.160]   our treasure in singing, that is, how clearly he is glorified.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.560]   Same thing could be said about the great commandment, right?
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.400]   You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:03.600]   your mind, as more or less of our hearts are engaged, we show more or less clearly the
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.280]   worthiness of God to be loved.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:14.320]   So to wrap it up, let me take Paul's words when he speaks about his own preaching the
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:21.600]   mystery of Christ, which includes the truth that Christ is in you, the hope of glory.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:31.880]   He says—this is Colossians 4:4—"Pray that I may make it clear, which is how I ought
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   to speak."
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.960]   So he's asking, "Oh God, would you put it in the hearts of the Colossians to pray
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:45.880]   for me that when I open my mouth, the mystery of Christ, the glory of Christ would be clear?"
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:53.840]   Paul knew that when he preached the glories of Christ, the unsearchable riches of Christ,
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.200]   sometimes they were more clear than other times.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.040]   That's why he asked for prayer.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:07.440]   So he asked for the Colossians to pray that it might be more clear, which is another way
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.100]   of saying so that Christ would appear more glorious.
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:21.000]   So that's the way I think about the gradations of glorifying Christ.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Very good thoughts.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.080]   And thank you for the great follow-up question, Devin.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.320]   Perhaps you've been listening for a while and you want clarity on something that you've
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   heard.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.880]   Maybe you have an episode or episodes that you want to better understand.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:42.680]   Give me the episode numbers, send me an email, and do that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.520]   Well it's never a bad time to soak in the glorious truths of Psalm 16.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.920]   A glorious psalm.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.160]   I know a lot of you have memorized it by heart.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.640]   Pastor John certainly has.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.600]   And that is the theme up next time.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.120]   I'm your host Tony Reiki.
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.400]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday for Psalm 16.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Amen.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   Amen.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.400]   Amen.
