[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   Today on Grace To You.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.660]   All of us would want to come to the end of life and say,
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.000]   I fought the good fight, right?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.700]   He could actually come to the end of his life and did,
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.900]   and he said, I have fought the good fight.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.040]   I have kept the faith.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.180]   I have finished the course.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.220]   He doesn't defect.
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.480]   He doesn't give up.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.480]   He doesn't give in.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.640]   Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.680]   which the Lord shall give to me, but not to me only,
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120]   but to all who love his appearing.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.320]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.820]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:01:07.800]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.180]   2 Corinthians 4.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.920]   2 Corinthians 4.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.580]   If you look at verse 3,
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.860]   the apostle says,
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.580]   If our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.960]   in whose case the God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.660]   so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.800]   who is the image of God.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   I just want to focus on that incredible statement.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.380]   The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.100]   who is the image of God.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120]   The light is just that.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.860]   That defines the light that we shine into the darkness.
[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.920]   It is the light of the gospel, the good news of the glory of Christ,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.760]   who is the image of God.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.540]   It says it again down in verse 6.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.620]   The one who has shone in our hearts has done so to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.920]   in the face of Christ.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.220]   The light is the gospel of Christ.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.760]   Christ is the very incarnation and image of God.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.480]   That's why we're here,
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.580]   and that's why he says in verse 5,
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.480]   we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.700]   and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.600]   Now, necessarily, when you're preaching,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.140]   when you're preaching Christ,
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.560]   you're calling sinners to repent.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.360]   It is necessary if they are to receive the good news
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.560]   that they hear the bad news.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.360]   They don't want that.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.680]   They love the darkness rather than the light.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.100]   They cherish their sins.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.020]   They flaunt their sins to one degree or another.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.220]   Even Jesus said in John 7:7,
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.760]   "You hate me because I tell you your deeds are evil."
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.580]   That is the gospel.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.680]   That is what generates the hostility and the hate.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.340]   Because first of all, the dominating human sin is pride.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.720]   People want to defend their goodness, their nobility.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.440]   And when you unmask the wretchedness of their hearts, they're usually angry.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.980]   In the flesh, they're angry, and apart from the convicting work of the Holy Spirit, they
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.460]   will remain angry.
[00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.560]   In the face of opposition, they're angry.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   In the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.

[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560]   And in the face of persecution, they're angry.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.740]   So how do you have that kind of bravery?
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.520]   How do you have that kind of courage?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.060]   It comes from convictions.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.320]   It comes from down inside related to the things that you believe that are non-negotiable.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.760]   And we've been looking at those, and today we'll take a few of them.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.160]   I don't think we'll finish the chapter.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.960]   But I just want to remind you of the first one.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.480]   The first thing that was a conviction, a certainty in Paul's mind was he was certain about the
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.380]   superiority of the new covenant.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.980]   In verse 1, "Since we have this ministry," what ministry is he talking about?
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.200]   The one he just described in chapter 3.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.060]   You go back to chapter 3, and you look, for example, at verse 7.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:25.100]   He describes the old covenant, the law, as the ministry of death in letters engraved
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.060]   on stones.
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.700]   It had glory so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses because
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.200]   of the glory of His face fading as it was.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:42.620]   If there was glory in the law, which only condemned, how will the ministry of the Spirit
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.420]   fail to be even more with glory?
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.820]   For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.760]   abound in glory.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.260]   So he is saying the new covenant in Christ has far more glory than the old covenant
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.820]   law.
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.020]   He had no - this is important.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.960]   He had no hesitation regarding the truth of the gospel.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.120]   That's where everything starts.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.660]   That's why we make such an issue out of you understanding the gospel.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.820]   You must understand it.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.280]   You must believe it.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.660]   You must understand its superiority and its absolute uniqueness and excellence.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:31.100]   He knew as a former Pharisee who had lived in extreme bondage to the old covenant - and
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.840]   that, of course, didn't save him, it only condemned him.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.860]   But he knew what it was to live at the most extreme level under the law.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.620]   And when he came to Christ, he found that the righteousness of God, a free gift to him
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:52.480]   by faith, far surpassed the bondage of his effort at self-righteousness.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   I think it's true to say that the people who have been delivered from the worst are more
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.660]   likely to be eager to talk about the best.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:10.200]   Many of us kind of grew up in a Christian family where we were delivered from our sins,
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.480]   but not in the way that someone is delivered who has lived virtually a lifetime in lies
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.580]   and error and bondage.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.700]   I think it's true to say in the church the people who have been saved from the most,
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.980]   as Jesus said, are the most thankful and likely to talk the most about the glories of the
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:28.980]   new covenant.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.480]   For the rest of us, we have to gain that conviction, not from our own experience.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.080]   But from what we know about the truth.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.760]   So Paul had certainty about the superiority of the new covenant.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.140]   From personal experience, he was passionate about making sure sinners heard the good news.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.500]   Secondly, he was certain that ministry was a mercy.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.660]   He says, "We have this ministry as we received mercy."
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:03.300]   That is to say, he never lost sight of the fact that this was an overwhelming mercy to
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:09.180]   allow him to preach this message.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.320]   This is not something that you earn by your education.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.040]   This is not something that you earn by your erudition.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.300]   This isn't something you earn because you have a gift for speaking.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.380]   Any of us who has ever been given the privilege of proclaiming the gospel knows it is a mercy.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.960]   We preach a far better message than we can live.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.120]   But we also understand that.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.580]   If God couldn't use flawed people, He couldn't use anybody because we're all flawed.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:47.960]   Paul never got over the mercy of putting him into the ministry, as we saw in 1 Timothy.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.500]   The third certainty in his life that we looked at last time was he was certain of the need
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.620]   for a pure heart.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.400]   And that's what he says in verse 2, "We've renounced the things hidden because of shame."
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.620]   There's no secret life.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.460]   There's no hidden life.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.220]   There's nothing to be discovered.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:17.640]   We have been exposed to the uncovering of an evangelist and an apologist who died, and
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:25.100]   after his death, there's an unbelievable explosion of wretchedness that comes out of the testimonies
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.480]   of the people whom he abused.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.440]   Some men's sins follow after them.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.060]   Paul says.
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:43.240]   Paul had no fear of that, no fear of that, no fear of a post-mortem episode where the
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.200]   truth would come out because he had no hidden life of shame.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:52.100]   He said his conscience was clear, and he was winning the spiritual battle on the inside.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:58.040]   And if you want to be useful to the Lord, you need to be a clean vessel.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.260]   And we saw, fourthly, that he was certain of the doubt.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.840]   He was certain of the duty to accurately preach the Word.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.800]   He says, "Not walking in craftiness or deceptiveness or adulterating the Word of God, but rather
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.380]   by the manifestation of truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.240]   sight of God."
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.320]   Not walking in craftiness or adulterating the Word, that's the negative.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.660]   But by manifestation of the truth, that's the positive, he was commending himself even to
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.080]   the unbelievers.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.320]   And in the sight of God.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.820]   That brings us to a fifth point.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.440]   The apostle was certain that salvation is the sovereign work of God, and this is where
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.340]   we stopped last time.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:53.580]   Paul was certain that salvation is the sovereign work of God.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.400]   Immediately in verse 3 he says, and this is so helpful to us because we're asking the
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400]   question.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.900]   "So we have a pure life.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.540]   We are faithful in handling the Word of God, proclaiming the truth, commending ourselves
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.200]   to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.360]   Why don't we have results?
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.400]   Why don't we get the results we want?"
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.900]   Paul immediately says, "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing."
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:30.720]   The category of people who by nature are perishing, those who are perishing, to them, he says in
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   1 Corinthians 1:18.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.680]   The gospel is foolishness.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.700]   It is not understandable, 1 Corinthians 2:14.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:44.440]   The natural man understands not the things of God, they're foolishness to him.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:50.240]   It's incomprehensible because the people in the category of the perishing, those who are
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:56.240]   on their way to hell, are by definition dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.540]   They have no mechanism to respond to the truth.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:09.280]   Further, not only are they perishing, but the God of this world has blinded the minds
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.600]   of the unbelieving.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.780]   The very category of perishing is a consistency or a state of blindness.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:23.540]   But he adds a kind of double blindness, a satanic kind of blindness, so people can't
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.860]   see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.360]   So this is the resistance.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.540]   We have.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.640]   They resist us because they're offended.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.240]   They resist us because they're bound in death.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:48.320]   They resist us because they're satanically blinded.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:56.680]   Romans 11:8 says, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes to see not and ears to hear
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.020]   not."
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.180]   They can't see.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:08.380]   The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, they can't comprehend.
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.280]   They are stone blind.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.700]   Just to comment on that phrase, the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.920]   is the image of God.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.500]   Christ has glory as the image of God, right?
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   He has glory.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.560]   He shares the glory of the Father.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.000]   Hebrews 1, he's the exact representation of the Father.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.920]   The image of the Father.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.760]   In Him all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.800]   He is the fullness of God's revelation.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   John 1:14, "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, and it was
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.060]   the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:57.620]   So He has glory in His incarnation as God.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.820]   He has glory as the image of God.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:07.020]   But there's a second kind of glory being talked about here, and it is this: He has
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.860]   the glory of the gospel.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.700]   Yes, He has glory as the image of God.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.720]   That's His intrinsic glory.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.140]   That belongs to Him eternally.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.500]   That's why in John 17:5, He said to the Father, "Restore to Me the glory I had with You before
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.820]   the world began."
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:30.180]   That glory He eternally possessed, the divine glory of the eternal Son of God.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.640]   He always thought He was the Son of God.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.240]   He always possessed that intrinsic glory as God.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:41.820]   But in the gospel, His glory is manifested in a new way, in a new way.
[00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:47.880]   The gospel allows the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ to be demonstrated in
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.760]   a new way.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:17:00.460]   And I think the most wonderful way to understand that, perhaps, is to look at Ephesians 1.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:08.020]   We have a repeated phrase.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   If you look down to verse 6, you'll see a phrase, "To the praise of the glory of His
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.620]   grace."
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.260]   To the praise of the glory of His grace.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.280]   That is really the new revelation of His glory.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.800]   He is glorious as the image of God.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:43.840]   But there is a new manifestation of that glory, the glory of His grace.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:51.040]   By His death and by His resurrection, He triumphed to provide regeneration for His
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.040]   people.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:18:00.100]   He defeated Satan, conquered death, satisfied divine justice, propitiated God's wrath, redeemed,
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:08.660]   rescued His people from judgment and hell, and so perfectly fulfilled that assignment
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:14.040]   God gave Him, that God gave Him a name above every name, the name Lord at which every knee
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.600]   should bow.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:24.280]   When we go to heaven, no doubt we will celebrate the glory of Christ as a person.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.920]   But when you look at the saints in heaven, you see particularly that they are praising
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.740]   Him for the glory of His grace.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.240]   Revelation 4.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.060]   You have 24 elders.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:49.100]   They come before Him who sits on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever and ever,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:55.680]   and they sing of how worthy He is.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.740]   He has glory, honor, and power.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:01.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:10.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:24.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:29.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:40.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.740]   They sing of how worthy He is.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:14.580]   The celebration crescendos past creation to the glory of His grace.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.300]   This is the high point of His glory.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.240]   Do you understand that?
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:24.860]   When we get to heaven, He will be the slain Lamb with the scars.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:32.260]   Salvation, grace will be the primary theme of heaven.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.740]   As glorious as He is, as brightly as He shines.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:46.700]   As wondrous as His eternal light of perfection, and as blessed as the glory of His grace appears
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:54.500]   in the gospel, the perishing and the blind cannot see it.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.160]   Do they have any hope?
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.580]   This is where we turn to verse 6.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:12.960]   How can the dead sinner, the blind sinner, believe?
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.560]   For God said - He's looking back to Genesis 1:3, "Let there be light.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.880]   Light shall shine out of darkness."
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.260]   That's creative.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.620]   God spoke light into existence in creation.
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:35.420]   And the One who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shown
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.920]   in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.440]   How do you come to a correct understanding of the light of the knowledge of the glory
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.120]   of God in the face of Christ?
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:54.940]   Because God does a creative miracle.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:02.180]   God shines in our hearts.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.160]   Light shall shine out of darkness.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.260]   Salvation is the light of God.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.200]   Light of Christ shining in the darkened heart.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.660]   It's a creative act.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.500]   That's why 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new - " what?
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   " - creature."
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   You have been created.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.420]   You're a new creation.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.080]   What role does the sinner have?
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.000]   The sinner's role is to believe, to repent and believe.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.100]   Can an unaided sinner repent?
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   No.
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.040]   That's why God has to grant repentance.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.860]   Can an unaided sinner believe?
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.860]   No.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:46.040]   That's why you're saved by grace, and that not of yourselves.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.740]   Even the faith is a gift of God.
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:57.740]   God gives you the gift of repentance and faith because He wills to give you life.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.920]   So what are all these people doing trying to come up with mechanisms that are going
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.740]   to save people?
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.940]   I saw that.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.640]   It's a bizarre statement about a Christian singer who died that his greatest achievement
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.600]   was leading millions to Christ.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.400]   What?
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.500]   That's not a human achievement.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.560]   I don't know what it even refers to.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.820]   There's only one way that people will ever be redeemed and taken out of their death and
[00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.980]   darkness, and that is by a sovereign, creative miracle of God, which produces in them repentance
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.980]   and faith.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.240]   That's the first way.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.660]   The second way is by a sovereign, creative miracle of God, which produces in them repentance.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:39.660]   There's only one way.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.660]   It's the first way.
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.660]   The second way is by a sovereign, creative miracle of God, which produces in them repentance.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:42.660]   The third way is by a sovereign, creative miracle of God, which produces in them repentance.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   It's not just about the faith.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.660]   It's about the faith and the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:45.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's about the faith that God has for them.
