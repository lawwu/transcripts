[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   As we come now to the Word of God, I want you to turn in your Bible to Ephesians, chapter
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.920]   6.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.840]   We are going to look to the next portion of Scripture in our study in Ephesians.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.840]   We are really coming to the very end after many months in this wonderful epistle.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.200]   And this morning we are going to go back to chapter 6, verses 10 through 17.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.900]   We looked at the first part of it last week, and we'll wrap it up this morning.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.980]   We will be considering the believer's armor, which is a familiar portion of Scripture.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.340]   And I think it was back in 2008 or so I did a series on this.
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.940]   It may have been eight or nine messages, which are available at the Grace To You website.
[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.280]   But for us in this season, I'm just going to consider the armor of the believer in one
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   message.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.180]   And we'll look at it.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.140]   We'll gather it all together this morning.
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.880]   To begin with, let me read, starting in verse 10 of Ephesians 6: "Finally, be strong in
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020]   the Lord and in the strength of His might.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.160]   Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.040]   of the devil.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.880]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.160]   powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spirit of the devil.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.860]   We are the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.060]   Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.920]   evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.400]   Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:58.140]   of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace,
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.620]   in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620]   all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.540]   And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God."
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.340]   This is really Paul's wrap-up on this amazing letter to the Ephesians, after giving us so
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.920]   much information in the opening three chapters about salvation, and so much already in chapters
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.120]   4, 5, and 6.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.100]   And he's talking about the sanctification.
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.020]   He comes to his final emphasis, as he notes in verse 10, saying, "Finally, to draw our
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.640]   attention to the fact that there is a war, and we are in that war by virtue of being
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.700]   a part of the kingdom of light.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.560]   Because we belong to the Lord, we are at war with the devil and his schemes."
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.100]   Now, verse 11 kind of sums up the text: "Put on the full armor of God, so that you
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.440]   will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil."
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.740]   The devil has schemes.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.000]   You want to stand firm.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   You can do that if you put on the full armor of God.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.960]   We need to understand that we have a supernatural enemy, that our enemy is not only the flesh,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   our fallenness, our unredeemed fallenness, but the enemy is the devil, and the Bible
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.400]   says so much about him.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.700]   He originally was the anointed cherub, Lucifer.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.620]   Lucifer may have been the worship leader of heaven and the holy angels before his rebellion.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.700]   He rebelled against God and took with him in the rebellion a third of the holy angels,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.420]   and they became his demon force.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.540]   Scripture identifies him as the prince of this world, the prince of the power of the
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.060]   air, the god of this age, and the prince of the world.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:08.320]   demons." This is a real supernatural force of wickedness in the heavenlies. That means
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.120]   in the spiritual realm. He has personal names. Fifty-two times in scripture he is referred
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.080]   to as Satan, which means adversary. Thirty-five times he is referred to as the devil, which
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.700]   means slanderer. He is called the serpent, the great dragon, the roaring lion, the evil
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:37.880]   one, Abaddon or Apollyon, which means destroyer. He is called tempter, accuser, murderer, liar,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:48.020]   sinner, perverter, and angel of light. This powerful spirit and his demon hosts are set
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.060]   against God, Christ the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.040]   They hate the Holy Spirit and the Father, the triune God. They hate everything about
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.300]   God, about truth. They hate Scripture. They hate Israel. They hate the church. They hate
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.560]   righteousness. They hate the law of God and the Word of God. So he and his demons are
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.040]   making war against God every way they can. They are the spiritual force behind the evil
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:31.920]   the human visible force of evil that we see in the world; they control the world system.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.420]   And in so doing, one of their enterprises is to stalk Christians.
[00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.180]   "The devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour," - stalking Christians
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:51.260]   in order to trip them up, in order to devour them, render them useless, joyless, fruitless,
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.260]   and useless.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.860]   Now obviously, He cannot snatch them away.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.720]   He is a snatcher.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.260]   As we know in Matthew 13, He snatches the Word; but in John 10, no one is able to snatch
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.300]   us out of the hand of the Father and the Son.
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.200]   He cannot ultimately win the victory, because greater is He that is in us than he that is
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.640]   in the world.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.100]   He cannot win the victory, even though He runs the world system of evil, because we
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.480]   have in Christ overcome the world.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.700]   So we don't want to give Him more power than He has.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.440]   He cannot remove us from the hand of the Father or the Son.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.820]   He cannot remove the Spirit from us.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.160]   He cannot take away our eternal salvation.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.780]   Nothing will ever separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, nothing, including
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.200]   Satan and all the demon forces.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:49.700]   But He comes after us in order to, as I said, make us useless in the kingdom, fruitless,
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.960]   joyless, unproductive Christians.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.880]   And Scripture tells us in this passage that our responsibility is to resist.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.640]   You see that that is the verb in verse 13, "resist," or "stand firm," as in verse 11
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.660]   and the end of verse 13.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.060]   We're never told to chase the devil, run after the devil, talk to the devil, denounce the
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.060]   devil.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.920]   In fact, it's clear that that's foolishness.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.520]   You don't bring in a railing accusation against a supernatural being over which you have no
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.700]   power and no authority.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.380]   Christ had authority over all of them; so did the apostles.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.560]   We don't.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.960]   That's why the demons in the book of Acts, when they were being exercised supposedly
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.680]   by the sons of Sceva, said, "Jesus we know, and Paul we know; but who are you?"
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.480]   They know who has the power, and it was Christ and the apostles.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.140]   We don't chase Satan.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.480]   We don't denounce Satan.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.720]   We resist him and stand firm.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.020]   And the question is, with this kind of massive heavenly hierarchy described in verse 12 as
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:08.940]   rulers, powers, world forces of this darkness, and spiritual forces of wickedness in the
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.400]   heavenlies, we have a formidable enemy.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.020]   This is an enemy that is ancient.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.940]   The demons were created originally.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.760]   These holy angels, they fell sometime near the creation.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.780]   They've been around ever since.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.820]   There have not been any creation of angels since the original one.
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.100]   So these demons have plied their trade for millennia in the world.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.680]   They are crafty, they are cunning, and they are relentless.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.780]   And even though they know the end from the beginning because Scripture lays out their
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.740]   inevitable end, they resist and fight against that and fight against God.
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.260]   And they are not able to resist God because they are permanently so evil they can't do
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.200]   anything else.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:03.020]   You'll notice that they are defined or described as rulers, powers, world forces, and spiritual
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.200]   forces.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.860]   These are the different ranks or strata of demons.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:16.460]   Back in chapter 1, verses 20 and 21, the holy angels are described in similar ranks.
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.540]   So these demons are the ones that are the most powerful.
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.300]   The demons have certain roles to play.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.080]   Some are rulers.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.300]   Some are known by their evil power.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.620]   Some are behind the world governments.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.520]   They are world forces.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:40.900]   They are the ultimate globalists who are pushing the world toward one final evil world kingdom
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:46.300]   ruled by antichrist under the full power of Satan.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.540]   People say to me, "Do you think there's a scheme for a one-world government?"
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   Absolutely, and it's not a scheme of men.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.820]   It's a scheme of Satan, and he's moving rapidly in that direction.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.560]   Everything points to that.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:10.380]   The real enemy is behind the human forces of evil, and it is the power of Satan and
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   his demons.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.100]   They are the world forces of this darkness.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   They are the spiritual forces.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.720]   They are the forces of wickedness.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.680]   And the truth is, according to verse 12, we struggle against them.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.060]   Our struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.060]   People are not our enemy.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.600]   They are the mission field.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.100]   They are Satan's dupes.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.380]   They are Satan's agents.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.620]   They are the children of the devil, the Bible says.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:44.100]   They have his desires, and they do his bidding, but behind them, the real struggle is with
[00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.900]   the forces of evil.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:52.380]   of supernatural, spiritual beings who are doing everything they can to destroy the work of God
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:59.740]   and destroy the usefulness of God's people. So this is a severe, serious struggle.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.300]   The word struggle in the Greek is "pole" , and it basically is simply,
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.900]   if you just took it in the literal sense, it means "to swing around back and forth."
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.780]   So it became a word used for wrestling, which is what happens in a wrestling match
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:20.540]   as two opponents grapple with each other. We are in a wrestling match with a very, very
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:27.500]   powerful enemy, not to be taken lightly without sad, sad results.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:35.260]   Now, in the end, the Lord will triumph. Romans 16:20 says that God will crush Satan shortly
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:42.540]   under our feet. Revelation 19 and 20 describe the end of Satan, how the Lord Jesus in His return
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   takes Satan and his demons and throws them forever into the lake of fire prepared for them.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:57.900]   Christ has already won the victory over Satan. And you remember the apostle Paul said in Colossians
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:05.180]   that when He died on the cross, He showed up in the presence of demons and declared His triumph
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:12.300]   over them at the cross. But in the meantime, we are living in what Paul in verse 13 calls,
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.260]   "the evil day." What day is that? That's any day there's evil. And what day is that?
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:24.220]   That's every day. So living in this evil day, understanding this formidable,
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:33.420]   massive, supernatural, global force of spiritual beings set on fighting everything
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   about God and His kingdom and His plan, we have a real challenge, a real struggle.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.660]   And because we can't see it doesn't mean it's not there. So how do we deal with it? Well,
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.300]   verse 11, again, back to the summation statement, "Put on the full armor of God
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.540]   so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes or the methods of the devil."
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:03.900]   You have to put on the armor of God. "Put on" there, by the way,
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:11.820]   is a verb that means "put on and leave on." It's a permanent statement, "Put it on and
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:18.220]   keep it on once for all time, not on and off like some kind of a uniform when you go to play a game
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:27.420]   for a team. This war never ends. There is no time to rest. There is no R and R. There is no leave.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:36.060]   This is constant. And we put on the armor of God to be able to stand
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.580]   firm. He says it twice, once at the end of verse 11 and once at the
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:48.060]   end of verse 13, "having done everything to stand firm." It doesn't matter what you've done
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.380]   if you don't stand firm at the end. And that's a really important word to emphasize.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.660]   There are a lot of people who do a lot of things in terms of the kingdom and kingdom ministry and
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:03.100]   kingdom work and preaching and teaching and serving, but when the dust settles, they're
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:10.220]   not standing at the end. We all know about that. It's a pretty common thing that Satan is able to do
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:19.420]   damage to some in the kingdom and dire damage to leaders, pastors, Bible teachers,
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.700]   et cetera, et cetera, all the way down through the ranks of Christians. The goal is that when
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:31.260]   the battle finally ends, at the very end, having done everything you've done, you're standing firm.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:40.060]   It's what Paul called for in 1 Corinthians 15:58, "Be steadfast, immovable,
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.340]   always abounding in the work of the Lord." Steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:56.140]   of the Lord. Or doing everything, and at the end of everything, you're still standing. And you might
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:04.060]   say, "Is it possible with such a formidable enemy?" And his devices are so massively effective today
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.980]   with the media, the internet, and the culture encroaching on us whether we want it or not.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.460]   Is it possible at the end to be standing? It's not only possible, it's expected of us,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:23.340]   and the reason is because we have the armor. We have the armor. It's a question of putting it on
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:30.300]   and taking it up, as we will see. So I'm going to give you just really an overview of this armor.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.060]   I think this will be helpful to you to do it in one setting.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:40.620]   Paul is a prisoner at this time, and of course, he's surrounded by Roman soldiers because,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:41.340]   and of course, he's surrounded by Roman soldiers because,
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:48.700]   he's imprisoned by Rome. And he's seen plenty of Roman soldiers in his life and ministry traveling
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:56.620]   through the Roman world. And he finds in the Roman soldier a good illustration of what is
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:02.780]   necessary for the believer to be victorious in the battle against the schemes of the devil.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:10.380]   And so he draws his picture out of the vivid reality of a Roman soldier. They're very possibly
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:16.140]   a Roman soldier, and they're very possibly was one nearby, if not in full armor, nonetheless a
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.260]   Roman soldier nearby even when he wrote this under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:31.900]   Now the first piece of armor is in verse 14. "Stand firm, stand firm, for the third time,"
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:40.140]   he says, "stand firm." That's the third time. "Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:46.220]   the strength of truth." He starts with a belt as the first aspect of armor. Why would he do that?
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:54.620]   Well, that's a very common place to start if you're a soldier. People wore tunics in those days,
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.580]   and you would have a tunic that was probably below your knees typically. That was
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:05.500]   what gentlemen did. And if you were going to engage in war, that was the kind of clothing
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.420]   you would wear. You had to do something because you can't go into war with your skirt blowing in
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:09.900]   the breeze.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:15.740]   So this loose piece of material around your neck with armholes wasn't going to
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:21.420]   be an aid to any kind of success in battle. So the first thing they would do is put on a
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:27.820]   leather belt, a wide leather belt, pull up the hem and the edges of their tunic,
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:33.340]   turn it into some kind of a male miniskirt, if you will, so that it didn't encumber them,
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.220]   and somebody couldn't pull it over their head and stab them, and that would be it.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.200]   So,
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:45.500]   they were covered with appropriate undergarments. But the first thing you did as a soldier when you
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.780]   knew you were going to face battle was get yourself in a position with your tunic that
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.260]   it was not going to be harmful to you, it was not going to be a danger.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.740]   "Girding your loins" is an old expression. It appears in the Old Testament, "girding your loins."
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:09.420]   It was a picture of preparation. For example, in Exodus 12, "girding your loins" to leave,
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.580]   "give Egypt" at the Passover time. It was a way to pull in the loose ends is what it's talking about.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:25.820]   Gather everything up. Trim everything down. Get ready. And having girded your loins with truth
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:33.340]   is borrowed, interestingly enough, from the book of Isaiah. Isaiah 11:5 speaks of Messiah,
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.180]   Messiah the branch who will be empowered by the Holy Spirit, who will fear the Lord,
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:45.100]   who will judge righteously, who will slay the wicked. And it says of Messiah, "Righteousness
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:53.660]   shall be the belt of His loins and faithfulness the belt of His waist." So in that case,
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:59.260]   it's a belt of righteousness and a belt of faithfulness. It's that that pulls everything
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:08.140]   together as the Messiah goes to war. It speaks of Messiah's final readiness for the final conflict.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:14.620]   He is prepared for battle. And what is the belt that pulls everything together?
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:23.820]   Well, in the text it says the belt of truth or the girdle of truth. It could be content. It could be
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:30.780]   truth as such, sound doctrine. That's certainly important. But I think it's better understood,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:37.100]   the term eleitheia is better understood as truthfulness, truthfulness.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:45.580]   It is the idea that you're committed. There's no hypocrisy. You know there's a battle. You're ready
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:53.180]   for the battle. It's that notion that is conveyed in girding up your loins. For example, in Luke 12:35,
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:59.260]   we read, "Gird up your loins and keep your lamps lit, ready for the moment your master shows up."
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:06.460]   It's a picture of readiness, readiness to move, to be engaged in something. You need all the
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:16.300]   things you can have. Or in 1 Peter 1:13, "Having therefore girded your minds for action." Girded your
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:23.420]   minds for action. That's what it is. It's getting ready for the action. So that is what I see in the
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:30.220]   belt of truth. It's preparation. It's readiness. It's not so much the content of truth as it is
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:38.220]   truthfulness. It's used in the sense of the absence of hypocrisy, the presence of real commitment.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:45.660]   And so, in 1 Peter 1:13, "Earnestly contending for the faith." Hebrews 12, "Laying aside every weight
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:51.740]   in the sin which so easily besets us. All encumbrances are set aside." Or Romans 12:1,
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:58.140]   "Presenting yourself as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God." Or 1 Corinthians 9, where the
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:06.860]   apostle Paul says that, "I don't beat the air. I fight as one who wants to hit my opponent. I don't
[00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:16.540]   be disqualified by a failure to be serious and committed to the battle." Just a page over in
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:24.860]   Philippians 1, you can see it in verse 9, a similar illustration. "I pray that your love may abound
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.300]   still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment." Then verse 10, "So that you may
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:37.740]   approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ."
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:44.380]   It's about sincerity. It's about saying, "Look, this is the most important thing in my life."
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:51.900]   Paul talks about this in the language of 2 Timothy 2, where he talks about being a soldier,
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:22:00.860]   being a hardworking farmer, being someone who is entering in a race and is ready for the race and
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:07.500]   has no encumbrances and is highly trained. He also talks about it in 2 Timothy 2,
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:14.300]   when he talks about how you have to be a vessel, pure and cleansed for the Master's use.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:20.780]   So that's where we're starting. You need to make a commitment to this battle. That is obvious.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:29.180]   That's presenting yourself as a living sacrifice. That's making your commitment to fight the battle
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:37.260]   with your whole heart. So that's the point of the belt. You pull in all the loose ends
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:43.260]   of your life. You understand the seriousness of the war, and you're all in.
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:50.140]   The second piece of armor is the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:57.820]   You've already put on the belt of truth. That's the past tense. You have already put on the
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:05.820]   breastplate of righteousness. You did that when you were saved, in a sense. But the breastplate of
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.020]   righteousness is the belt of truth. You have already put on the belt of truth. You have already
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.740]   put on the belt of truth. You have already put on the belt of truth. You have already put on the belt
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:07.740]   of truth. You have already put on the belt of truth. You have already put on the belt of truth.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.500]   Has to be understood in a practical sense, not in a forensic sense, and I think I can show you that.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.700]   The breastplate of righteousness is vital. Let's start with breastplate. If you're a soldier,
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.100]   this covers the vital organs. This is critical. This is going to save you at the most
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   critical point of your anatomy. Breastplates were made sometimes out of heavy linen,
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:36.780]   and they would have pieces of hoof linked together on them, or pieces of metal protecting the vital
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:45.660]   organs, sometimes chain metal, sometimes linked metal, sometimes even solid kind of molded metal.
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.060]   And it went from the neck to the waist to obviously protect your vital organs.
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:59.180]   Now, you're going to be able to win if you have already put on this breastplate of righteousness.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:05.340]   And again, if you're a Christian, you already have the righteousness of Christ. So this is not asking
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:13.100]   you to find on your own the righteousness that saves you. This is not that.
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:21.660]   This is the righteousness of practical godliness. You have to put on practical righteousness.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:29.900]   All that Satan needs really in attacking you is unrighteousness. Wherever there is sin in
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.820]   your life, then Satan has an opening, and he can make a thrust, and he can do some serious
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:43.340]   damage. We have the righteousness of Christ imputed to us at salvation, the very righteousness
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:51.820]   of God that is ours by faith in Christ. That's the gift of justification. What we're talking about
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:58.940]   here is something that you don't need to put on because you've already put on that righteousness
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:05.340]   of God through Christ. But this we're talking about is practical righteousness. The point would
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.060]   be better practice. The point would be better practice. The point would be better practice.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.580]   So the second point is that the Lord is not going to give you the opportunity to put on what you need.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.940]   The second point is that the Lord is going to give you the opportunity to put on what you need. So the
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.580]   first point is that if you have sin in your life, you're going to be ignorant of the devil's devices.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:22.300]   Second Corinthians 2, the Apostle Paul warns that if you have sin in your life,
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.380]   you're going to give the devil an opportunity. You're going to be ignorant of his devices.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:35.820]   Back in Ephesians 4, the same thing. If you look at verse 24, "Put on the new self." In
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:44.860]   other words, live consistently with your new life, which in the likeness of God has been created in
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:50.300]   righteousness and holiness of the truth. You have been created that way in a positional sense.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:57.020]   Now you need to live that way. So lay aside falsehood. Speak truth with each one of your
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:03.980]   neighbors for members of one another. Be angry and do not sin. Don't let the sun go down on your anger,
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:11.100]   and don't give the devil an opportunity. So any kind of sin in your life allows the devil
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:19.740]   access to do damage. In 1 Corinthians 15:34, the Apostle Paul said, "Awake to righteousness,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:26.780]   and do not sin." In 2 Corinthians 7:1, he says, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.220]   defilement of the flesh, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:35.340]   So again, when you came to faith in Christ, you were granted righteousness.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.980]   The very righteousness of God was imputed to your account. That doesn't mean you became
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.540]   totally righteous. That's a process of sanctification. And you're in the middle
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:52.060]   of that process responding to biblical commands to be godly and holy, will produce the kind of
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:27:00.700]   righteousness by the Holy Spirit that will allow you to be secure against the assaults of Satan.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.100]   You have to understand that. You can't cultivate sin. You can't
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:11.340]   have areas of your life that are given over to sin, given over to transgression,
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.900]   I don't care what it is, anything pornography to anger and everything in between,
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:22.140]   because you have vulnerability to the powers of darkness if that is the case.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:28.300]   So to start with, you have to go into this Christian life with a complete commitment,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:34.860]   tie up all the loose ends, and realize you're going to have to fight this battle with some sober
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:41.900]   mindedness. And secondly, you need to make sure that you're protected by righteousness,
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:48.380]   by godliness, by holiness. Pursue holiness in the fear of God.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:58.300]   The third piece of armor which is to be put on, verse 15, "Having shod your feet with the
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.620]   preparation of the gospel of peace." And again, you're going to be able to fight the battle,
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:11.100]   if you take up the armor. And if you take up the armor, then you have put on the belt,
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:18.060]   you have put on the shield, and you have put on the shoes. Now shoes in our culture are pretty
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:26.140]   much a fashion statement and not much else, because we live in a hard surface world and not
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:34.380]   like the ancient world. Whenever I think about this passage, I always go back to a memorable moment when
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.660]   I was playing football in my college university days. And we had a game in the Rose Bowl, and it
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.700]   was late in the season. It was a day like today, and it was rainy. And I was back to receive the
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:55.420]   kickoff and to return the kickoff. And I had made a decision to wear some new football shoes that
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.140]   had just come into town. I was the only player on the team that had them. They were made by a
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:04.140]   German company called Adidas.
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:10.300]   That's right. This is the first year they were here. And Adidas is Adi Dassler,
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:17.020]   one of the Dassler brothers. The other one started Puma. So they came from Germany,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.260]   and they developed a soccer shoe into a football shoe, but it had very short studs on it.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:27.820]   And it was a tremendous improvement, because it had a plastic sole that couldn't absorb water.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:33.900]   And up until that time, football shoes were leather, and over a period of a season, they sucked
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.820]   up so much water. It was like having lead feet. But they did have longer spikes. But I thought,
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.660]   "You know, this is the time I'm going to switch over to these exotic new shoes."
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:48.700]   The kick came down. I caught the kick, took three steps, hit a mud spot,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:54.460]   and ended up flat on my back on the six-yard line. Not exactly where I wanted to be.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:30:03.660]   But it stood in my mind that I had made a foolish decision about having ill-prepared my feet. So in
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:09.420]   the interim few minutes, I went to the sideline, and I got the right kind of shoes. I haven't been
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:14.060]   in combat, but you have to have the right kind of shoes. And we have that illustrated to us all the
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:20.540]   time in athletics. You have to have whatever allows you to function in the combat of athletics.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   Footwear is very, very important. And in battle, it was far more important,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:33.420]   because it was life and death. And the Roman soldiers did marches, long, long marches. So they
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:42.380]   had to have tough leather boots. And they would literally take nails and push them through from
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:49.580]   the inside so they had like spikes, so they could move over the terrain, and so they could hold
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:55.260]   their ground when they were in hand-to-hand combat. Believe me, they weren't slipping and sliding in
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:03.180]   sandals. They had to have… It was a matter of life and death, necessary for long marches, durable,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:09.260]   and with the ability to grip the ground in such a way that they couldn't be pushed off balance.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:14.380]   Well, that is precisely what the apostle Paul sees here.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:23.340]   He sees the believer needing some shoes that anchor him or her, that allow him to take the full
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:32.940]   attack and not move – no slipping, no sliding. And what are the shoes? The gossips.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:40.740]   gospel of peace." This is marvelous - the gospel of peace. What do you mean by the gospel
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:46.280]   of peace? Well, let's go back to Philippians - I'm sorry - to Ephesians 2. Back to Ephesians
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:59.440]   2, verse 12: "Remember that you were at that time " - before your conversion " - separate
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:08.980]   from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise,
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:18.340]   having no hope, and without God in the world." That is the condition of a nonbeliever: separate
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:29.100]   from Christ, without God in the world. But what happens in salvation - verse 13: "Now
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world, you shall be a man of the world, and
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:29.140]   in the world, you shall be a man of the world." Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.160]   world. Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world. Now in Christ Jesus Christ,
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.180]   now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world. Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.200]   Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world. Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:29.260]   Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world. Now in Christ Jesus Christ, without God in the world.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:37.300]   Christ Jesus. You who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ,
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:44.120]   for He Himself is our peace."
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:52.240]   That's so important, "He Himself is our peace." So what happened at salvation? What do you
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.120]   mean, "He is our peace?"
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:02.640]   Listen to the language of Romans 5: "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:11.920]   with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." "Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:19.240]   Verse 10 says, "We were enemies; we are now reconciled to God through the death of His
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.680]   Son." So what does it mean to say, "The gospel of peace"? The gospel brings you peace
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.080]   with God.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:33.400]   We're not talking about psychological peace, emotional peace, experiential peace. We also
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:39.640]   are blessed with that as a fruit of the Spirit. But the main issue is that we have been made
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:50.680]   literally children of God. That's the peace that has taken place through Christ. We were
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.640]   enemies. We hated God. God was angry at us.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:02.580]   and the gospel produce peace.
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.520]   So how does that relate to the Christian life?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.480]   It relates to it in a very simple way: God's on your side.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.420]   Rather than being against you, rather than having the devil against you and God against
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:26.600]   you, you now have God for you to the degree that no ultimate harm can come your way.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.780]   There'll never be condemnation.
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.460]   Nothing will ever separate you from the love of Christ.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.540]   You have overcome the evil one.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.660]   Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.940]   You have overcome the world.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.920]   You have entered into triumphant promise.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:45.920]   "I am God."
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.320]   A triumphant covenant with Christ.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.820]   You have made peace with God.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:35:00.480]   Colossians 1, verses 20 and 21: "Through Him," through Christ, "to reconcile all things
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:06.540]   to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:12.360]   You were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds; yet He has now
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.480]   reconciled you."
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.420]   That's the peace we're talking about.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:22.980]   The good news is you have a formidable enemy, but God is on your side.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.860]   The Old Testament Psalms talk about, "God is my shield.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.560]   God is our rock.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.440]   God is our defender.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.800]   God is our deliverer.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.640]   God will never leave us or forsake us.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.480]   Christ will never allow us to be tempted above what we are able, but will always with that
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:44.220]   temptation make a way of escape."
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.820]   "I am God."
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:51.220]   We will triumph in Christ.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.620]   So as you go into this battle, you go without fear in that sense.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   I love this.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.640]   Even if you sin, listen to 1 John 2:1.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.920]   As much as we would like to have the perfect righteousness, we sin.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.820]   What does that do to our vulnerability?
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:14.320]   1 John 2:1, "My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin."
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:23.280]   But if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.580]   And when you do sin, you have an advocate, an intercessor, a great high priest who intercedes
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.460]   on your behalf so that nothing can ever separate you from God.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:37.780]   And so that is to say that all divine resources are yours.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.980]   All the resources in the heavenlies are yours.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.200]   God is yours, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.200]   2 John 2:1.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:48.180]   "I will come to your aid in the battle."
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:54.780]   So the first three parts of the armor: a belt that pulls everything together that speaks
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:37:01.080]   of commitment; a breastplate of righteousness that speaks of living a righteous and holy
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:07.100]   life as protection; and thirdly, being able to stand against anything and everything the
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:14.080]   devil throws at you because you have backing from the eternal God.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:22.400]   God, Creator, Redeemer, and your loving Father.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:30.960]   So commitment to live the truth, pursue righteousness, stand firm, trusting in God to give you strength.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.340]   That's the first part of your armor.
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:42.960]   And by the way, you put this on and leave it on your whole life.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.700]   Now we come to some additional parts of the armor.
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:52.080]   Number four, verse 16: "In addition, in addition."
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.580]   Here are some that you take up.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.940]   The others you have on all the time.
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:38:00.440]   Here are some that you take up at the time of battle.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.780]   First one is the shield of faith.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.380]   Thourion is the term.
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.340]   There are a number of Greek words for different shields.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:12.840]   There was a small round shield that a soldier had on his forearm, on his left forearm, typically,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.080]   and he would fight with a dagger with his right hand and parry blows with his left.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.780]   That's not this.
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:26.180]   This is thourion, which is like a small door, maybe four feet by two and a half feet.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.620]   Full protection, double protection.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:36.160]   On top of the breastplate you had this thick wood, usually covered with leather, and then
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:42.720]   the leather would be saturated with the non-flammable oil because darts, arrows would be shot at
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:48.820]   it, and they should be extinguished when they hit that saturated leather.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.680]   The way these shields were used was in a phalanx.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.760]   That's an old word, but basically the front of the army would put them side by side.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:08.360]   You'd have just wooden shields for many miles sometimes just in front of the enemy.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.600]   It was the double, double protection.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:21.380]   That's confidence in God's faithfulness beyond righteousness, beyond commitment.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.540]   You had this added protection.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.980]   You picked it up when the battle started.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.100]   And what are you defending yourself against?
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:35.560]   Well, he says, "This is how you extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one."
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.560]   The evil one is Satan.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.400]   His flaming arrows are temptation.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.480]   They hit that shield with that shield.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.800]   With that saturated leather, and it extinguishes the arrows.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.080]   What they used to do was take arrows, tip them with pitch, and just before they would
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:57.100]   shoot them, they would light them on fire, and it would just rain down on the opposing
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.520]   army all these fiery arrows.
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.580]   The idea was that if it could hit the man, it would splatter the pitch, and then the
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:12.360]   fire would move across him, and it could be deadly.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.240]   What are we talking about with these arrows?
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.540]   Well, we're obviously talking about temptation.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:21.020]   Satan is shooting temptation at us.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.460]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:35.120]   He shoots sins of temptations of impurity, anger, selfishness, doubt, fear, disappointment,
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.360]   discouragement, lust, greed, covetousness, pride, you name it, whatever is coming at
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.240]   us.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   Satan is shooting temptation at us.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.240]   We have double protection if we have the shield of faith.
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   What does that mean?
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:58.020]   It means that you extinguish Satan's temptations if you believe in God, if you truly believe
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:01.540]   not only in Him, but believe His Word.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.520]   Faith overcomes temptation.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.680]   In what sense?
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:10.220]   Well, what Satan wants you to do in a temptation is to believe that this is what you deserve,
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:12.120]   this is what you need.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.740]   This is satisfying.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.460]   This is something to be desired.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.840]   And the reason that God is withholding it from you is because He's mean, He's narrow-minded,
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.440]   He's legalistic.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.120]   That's exactly what Satan said to Eve in the garden.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.800]   "You can't trust God," he said.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.480]   You can't trust God.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.680]   God doesn't want you to be like Him.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.180]   You eat that fruit, you'll be like Him.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.380]   He doesn't want that.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.600]   God is not good like you think.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.000]   He's withholding a real, true satisfaction from you.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   He's not good like you think.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   He's not good like you think.
