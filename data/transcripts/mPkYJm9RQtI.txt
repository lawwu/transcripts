[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.800]   Emanuel, a listener in London, writes in, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.760]   How should Christians handle failure?
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   For example, failure at school or at work, not necessarily failures that are sinful,
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   per se.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.200]   How does the Bible address this issue, or does it?"
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200]   It does.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.520]   And it does in at least a couple ways.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.920]   I'm sure more, but two that I thought of.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.000]   And I'm thinking of positive, hopeful ways that it addresses Emanuel's issue.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.240]   The first thing the Bible wants to say is that all of us have failed.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.800]   None is without failure.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   If you think you haven't failed, two things are true of you.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.080]   One is you're blind to your failures, and the other is you probably haven't taken enough
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.160]   risks to try enough hard things so that you'd be aware of your failures.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.600]   So the first thing the Bible says about that, about those failures, is that there isn't
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.160]   any sinless failure.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.320]   I know Emanuel asked about, "What about failures that don't involve sin?"
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.080]   So the first thing, I'm going to go there.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.800]   I know what he's talking about.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.200]   But the first thing I want to say is that there aren't any.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.600]   Now that's devastating news and wonderful news.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.880]   Because the gospel exists for all failures.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:43.020]   This is freeing because we don't have to figure out whether we have sinned or not in a failure.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.600]   We can just assume we did.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.980]   I mean, isn't it wonderful that David prayed in Psalm 19, "Father or God, declare me innocent
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.560]   from hidden faults."
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   In other words, David knew that he could confess his sins all day long, and at the end of the
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.720]   day there would be some he didn't know about.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.600]   And I want to say that the Bible calls us to love God with all of our heart, and none
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.880]   of us has ever done that perfectly, and therefore every failure we've ever had of the simplest
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.800]   and most innocent kind has sin mixed in with it.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.680]   And the good news of the Bible is that is not destructive to us.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   We have the gospel.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.480]   We have the forgiveness of sins through the blood of Jesus.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   That's the first thing.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.000]   The second thing is that, yes, there is a kind of innocent failure.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.800]   Things that are owing to our natural incapacities and opposition from outside, and the Bible
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   has wonderful news about this.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.420]   I find great encouragement in this.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.000]   The way the Bible addresses this, at least the way that I've chosen to address it, is
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.520]   from 2 Corinthians 12, 7 to 10, where Paul talks about his weaknesses.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.280]   And I think we could all agree that if you fail at something, it's either owing to your
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.160]   own weakness, and I'm not thinking about sin here now, it's either owing to your own weakness
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.400]   or to other people's opposition.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.040]   And both of those are addressed here.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.120]   So here's what he says.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.920]   This is 2 Corinthians 12, 7.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.040]   To keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.560]   a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from being
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   too conceited.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.400]   Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take this away, and that it should leave me.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.280]   But he said, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.560]   My power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.680]   Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.720]   may rest upon me."
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.680]   This thorn incapacitated him in some way that frustrated him.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.120]   He wanted to do things, and he couldn't do them, and he was made weak.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.560]   Verse 10, "For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses."
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.920]   And then he adds, "insults, hardships."
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.900]   So he knows there's certain things that he's failed at or cannot do, not just because he's
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.600]   got an internal thorn weakness, but there are external hardships and insults and persecutions
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.240]   and calamities.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.920]   And then he says, summing it all up with the word "weak," "When I'm weak, then am I strong."
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.540]   So just here's a few things to notice.
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.800]   Even though Satan may be involved, he's not in control here.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120]   This thorn is to keep Paul from being conceited.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.640]   That is not Satan's goal.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   That's God's goal.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.000]   We know God's in control here using this thorn.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.600]   The second thing to notice is that Christ cares—what he cares about in life is not
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.960]   mainly our achievements for Christ, but our dependence on Christ.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.220]   My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.840]   My power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.560]   Christ's aim here is not that we overcome all our weaknesses and never fail.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.420]   His aim is that we trust him for his grace in our weaknesses, which implies in our inability
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.120]   to do what we'd love to do.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   We might wish we could make an A, or we might wish we could earn more money, or we might
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.080]   wish we could run faster, or that we were more pretty or taller or something, but he
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:53.480]   just wants us to not be devastated by our weaknesses, but rather display the peace-giving
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.600]   sufficiency of Christ.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.880]   And then notice, he wants us to be content with our limitations.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.520]   For the sake of Christ, then, Paul says, "I am content with weaknesses."
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:16.600]   And I'd like to go further and say that we can pray—and I've done this, and I think
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.520]   I might have said this on a previous podcast, I don't know, but it's worth saying again—we
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:31.120]   can pray that our failures not only leave us content in Christ, but that Christ uses
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:41.560]   them to wonderfully advance his cause and produce successes that we couldn't have had
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.880]   if we had been more successful by overcoming our weaknesses.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.880]   Here's the example I used.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   I read slowly, and my memory is not that great.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.120]   So I left academia.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.680]   I quit teaching college, in part, because I knew I could never be a great scholar.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.400]   I read too slow, I remember too little.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.680]   And I often was sad about that and self-pitying about that, which was sin, and I should have
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.980]   listened to this text quicker.
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:22.000]   But now what I realize is, okay, I fail at reading fast, I fail at remembering a lot,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   so what should I do?
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.280]   I should ask God, "Maximize who I am in this weakness for your glory."
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.400]   And so I discovered, well, I could take a small part of the Bible, and I could analyze
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   it enough so that I dug out of it riches that I could then proclaim, and people have gotten
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:53.560]   help from my limited ability, because I've made myself look at small chunks of literature
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.600]   instead of big chunks of literature, like whole books that I haven't had time to read.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.000]   So my point is, when it comes to failure, the Bible has two words.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.560]   Number one, the gospel covers the sins mixed in with all our failures.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:17.440]   And number two, if we trust Him, His sovereign grace will be sufficient, and He'll even turn
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.080]   the failures into gospel successes.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.320]   That's a great way to end.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.520]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.740]   And I usually try to close each podcast with a recommended episode that we've recorded
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.400]   in the past that relates to the topic at hand.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.840]   And today, this discussion about failures reminds me of a podcast we recorded by the
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.640]   title "Is Discouragement a Sin?"
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.200]   That was episode number 137, and you can find it in the archives.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.440]   So how do I know if I love God, or do I just love loving God?
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.320]   There's a subtle but profound difference between those two, and Evan writes in with an important
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.080]   follow-up question from a podcast discussion we started earlier.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.120]   We'll be back with that tomorrow.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.360]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.480]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.980]   [END]
