[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.360]   Speaking of farm, so I read--
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.700]   last week you were telling me about this big New Yorker
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.120]   profile of Wendell Berry.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.920]   So I went on your recommendation, and I read it.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560]   I had to read in the Physical Magazine,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.000]   because Wendell Berry--
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.820]   you got to read a Wendell Berry thing in physical form.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.120]   And that's really interesting.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.920]   Really interesting.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.980]   I mean, I knew about Berry, but it was interesting to hear,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.440]   more of a long form description of what his life was like.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.720]   The thing that caught my attention
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   is that he is a purified instantiation
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.520]   of this deep life philosophy that we talk about on the show.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.020]   I don't know if you had the same reaction, but think about it.
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.480]   This is someone who said, I'm going
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640]   to do exactly what's at the core of our notion of the deep life,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.280]   which we talk about in our core idea video on the deep life,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.760]   if people aren't familiar.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.320]   So YouTube page, core idea video on the deep life.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.120]   We talk about this.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.560]   But at the core of the deep life is making radical change
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.360]   to your life to put it into alignment with the things
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.200]   that you value.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.240]   And that's what Berry did.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   I mean, he moved-- he left New York
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.920]   to move to a farm in Kentucky near where he grew up
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.840]   to cultivate land with horses while teaching
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.280]   at a local college there.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.320]   Built his entire life around incredibly intentionally,
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.280]   here are the things I value, community, connection to land,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.880]   these older ways of living, the idea of writers
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.760]   having a-- being cited in a particular place and context
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.320]   from which they write about, as opposed to, as he talks about,
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.200]   just being in this cosmopolitan abstraction
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   where you live in a city and are of no place.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620]   And he did all those things and built a really unusual life
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.800]   around it.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.880]   But it sounds cool.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.240]   I don't know what your-- was your thought--
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.180]   my thought was, this sounds like kind of a cool life
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.120]   he built out there.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.160]   Well, a couple of things.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.440]   I mean, you read one of his books in the past month.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   I think it was January or December or something
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.420]   like that.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.720]   So I hadn't heard of him until you
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.880]   were explaining in the book that you read about him.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.800]   And then he came up here.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.480]   And he's a prolific writer.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.680]   He's written a ton of stuff.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.000]   I mean, he's probably like 80-something years old.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.360]   And he's written nonstop for--
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.920]   Nonstop.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.880]   --for 50 years.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.600]   Poems, novels, essays, and nonfiction books.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.480]   And he's a professor, was a professor, and a farmer.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720]   But they have no technology.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.320]   Didn't have a computer.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.400]   They weren't on the internet.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.240]   He wasn't on phone.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800]   So maybe it tells you something about you're up at dawn
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520]   to tend your horses, even if you have a teaching job.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.880]   You have a lot of time to write.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.520]   He lives in a town of 60 people, something like that.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   And he's related to half of them.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.080]   I'll tell you the big revelation of the article for me
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080]   was his writing shed.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.320]   I hadn't heard about that before, that he has this house.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.120]   It's overlooking a river.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.680]   Not a house.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   It's like a little cabin up on pillars,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.240]   because I guess the river overflows.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.120]   No electricity, no running water.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.440]   And he goes out there, and he writes.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.160]   And he's out there, and he writes.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.600]   But I love, in this piece, but also in the book of essays
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.120]   I read, how he knows the land, and he has a connection to it.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.200]   And he wanders the land and canoes on his river
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.920]   and is completely connected to his town
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.160]   in that particular place.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.520]   And now his family, multiple generations now, a lot of them
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.680]   all live around there.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.360]   And in the article, his daughter and his granddaughter
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720]   would just wander into their house.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   It really looks like a great case study
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.520]   of the deep life in action.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.000]   Figure out what matters to you.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.920]   Reorient your life around that, as opposed
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.800]   to arbitrary metrics that are nice in the moment
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.320]   or seem just culturally palatable,
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.520]   like just going up the ladder in a career
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   or just seeking distraction.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.280]   And then be willing to make radical changes.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   And what's more radical than leaving a teaching, writing
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.960]   job in New York and move to Kentucky?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.560]   Speaking of which, you do a good job of explaining the radical
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.960]   part, because it's important to do-- you explain it
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.920]   like there being some sort of a test before you do that.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   Because then you gave the example of the one fellow who,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.920]   in your book, who went to become a monk
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.760]   and didn't really work out.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.320]   So I think for new listeners, it's
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.720]   good to explain that briefly, just so they don't think
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.360]   that you jump into the radical part.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.960]   Yeah, radical is important, but it
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.680]   has to be aligned with your values.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.760]   So you have to make--
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.640]   if you really want to live deeply, ultimately,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.200]   you want to make some sort of radical shift,
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.480]   because that signals to yourself that you
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.720]   take this really seriously.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.400]   It makes it an adventure.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   And it allows you to really immerse yourself in that value.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.480]   So if Wendell had just said, I work in New York,
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.520]   but I live in northern New Jersey,
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.480]   but a little bit south, so I have
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.880]   a little bit of a plot of land.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.080]   And I really have a nice garden that I take care of,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.800]   because I find land really important.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.720]   And I take the commuter train into New York
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   and work in New York.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.240]   That's not the same thing as I'm using horses
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.160]   to plow land in Kentucky.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.760]   And there's something about the radicalness of what's important.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.200]   That's the immersion in the value.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.680]   You can make the value that you're
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   orienting towards a guiding direction for your life.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.800]   But radical without prep becomes just change
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.480]   for the sake of enjoying the disruption,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.400]   and that can fade out.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.800]   So you're right.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   It's so good they can't ignore you.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.600]   I talk about the guy who says, I'm going to go become a monk.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.280]   And he's in Mountain Monastery, and he gets there,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.480]   and is like, oh, all right, this is not immediately
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   making my life better.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.800]   And why exactly am I doing this other than the fact
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.600]   it's disruptive?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.200]   And he gave up on that.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.800]   I talked about in the video where
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.280]   we explained the deep life from that Core Ideas playlist,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.080]   the Mark Fredenfaller, where they
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.400]   moved to that island in the South Pacific.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.840]   And it's because of disruption.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.800]   You're like, hey, it's radical.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.560]   Change is radical.
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.480]   It's something to do.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.520]   And they're like, oh, this is terrible.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.400]   And we feel weird about it.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.640]   And our kids have lice.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   And they got ringworm.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.520]   And it was like, this is not great.
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.800]   And they couldn't open the coconuts.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   This is another thing I didn't leave out.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.840]   They imagined themselves just cracking open the coconuts.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.000]   And it turned out it's really hard to open coconuts.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800]   And they're like, this is terrible.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.640]   Why did we do this?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.720]   And then he went back and did make a radical change,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.200]   rebuilt his whole life around DIY, and started a new magazine,
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.520]   and getting back in touch with building things with his hands.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.000]   So that's actually the real story.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.520]   So I think it's a really important point,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.600]   is that you have to do something radical, really,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.320]   if you're going to embrace the deep life.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.880]   But it has to be very much oriented towards things
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   that are valuable to you.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.960]   You have to know why you're making
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.400]   that particular radical change.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.360]   And there's a lot of self-insight involved there.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.480]   And that would be fascinating, to really be a fly on the wall
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.240]   with Wendell Berry in his 20s, when
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.040]   he's trying to figure this out and trying to convince his wife,
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.360]   this is what we need to do.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.520]   A couple of things that come to mind.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.680]   One, the article was written by the daughter
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.160]   of his first editor, who has since passed.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.560]   But that was kind of cool to see the interchange of that
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.480]   throughout the story.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.760]   It was a long article.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.200]   And then talking about what he was like when he was younger,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.760]   there was a quote in there where someone was like,
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.080]   did you tell him to lighten up?
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.400]   I think he was pretty intense.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah, his book seemed to be pretty polemical.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.480]   His nonfiction work can be pretty polemical.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   And his new book, he's writing a book
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.720]   as an 80-something-year-old on racism.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   So that's going to be interesting, I think.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.640]   Two other-- yeah, I think it will be for sure.
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.680]   I don't think he cares.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.640]   He's like, whatever.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.360]   What did he say?
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.920]   He said, I'm 80.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.080]   I have friends.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.520]   I have family.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.200]   I don't care if people are mad at me.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.120]   And so I'll read it.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.440]   I think it'll be interesting.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.120]   Thoughtful guy.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   He's written about that in the past.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.840]   And I think that he's thought a lot about it.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.000]   Yeah, he did a lot of writing about the Civil Rights
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.600]   Movement and trying to understand it as a movement
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.680]   and compare and contrast it to other movements.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.280]   I don't remember the punchline, but I
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.440]   know he had some pretty provocative essays
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.640]   in the book I read that was comparing and contrasting
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.200]   the Civil Rights Movement to the environmental movement.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.800]   So he thinks a lot about movements and how they expand.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.120]   I mean, one of his main critiques, if I remember,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.800]   is the problem with movements is there's a certain place where
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   his real worry, which I think seems really relevant today,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.200]   but his real worry is when movements get
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.400]   separated from personal action.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.960]   So he talks about the environmental movement.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.680]   And he's like, what matters is you're in a place actually
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.840]   stewarding the land in that place
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.040]   and building up from personal experience
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.440]   a respect for land and its interaction with humans.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.920]   What he worries about is that you say, no, no, I just
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:39.880]   live in suburban America, and I give money
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.960]   to these groups that are trying to influence legislation.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.560]   Or today it would be-- and he's talked about this probably more
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.080]   recently--
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.640]   I tweet about things or change my Twitter profile
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.140]   or whatever.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.520]   And he says these movements become
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.720]   professionalized and abstracted.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.120]   And they're identity badges.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.400]   I'm a part of this movement.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400]   I wear the right thing.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.560]   I say the right things.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.240]   No action actually happens.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.720]   And my memory is when he was talking about the Civil Rights
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.080]   Movement, the degree to which I guess this was cited
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.000]   in personal action.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.800]   You were out there sitting at the lunch counters
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.520]   or this or that.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.080]   And so I think he was lamenting about
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.400]   the environmental movement.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.920]   But I think it's a big thing today
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.800]   that social media gives you the ability to superficially
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.000]   be connected with movements.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But it also accelerates the abstraction of these movements
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.600]   into just components of an identity presentation.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.520]   And there feels like there's a lot of crackling energy.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.200]   But that energy is not being conduited into actually
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.640]   any sort of motive force.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.000]   And so actually, yeah, I think this book will be interesting.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.760]   Interesting guy.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.380]   There was a cool part in the book where
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.120]   he was talking about the difficulty of writing.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   He's like, yeah, writing's hard.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.440]   And then he gave the story about when
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.000]   he goes out to change the wires at night and it's cold.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.280]   And he started doing the work.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.580]   And then it was getting better.
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.440]   And then he related that to writing and getting
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.200]   into the groove.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.600]   And yeah, if you're a farmer, you're used to hard work.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.920]   Yeah, writing's hard work.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.960]   That's always my thing is what writer's block
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.600]   is another way of describing what it feels like to write.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.400]   Because it's a weird, unnatural thing you're
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.480]   asking your brain to do.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.160]   So why are you rewarded for doing it well
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.920]   is because you're able to overcome that.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.080]   So the difficulty should be the first thing that you expect.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.040]   But anyways, I think we'll see more of Barry-style lifestyles
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   potentially in this current post-pandemic period
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.320]   where people are reinventing their lives
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:40.480]   and becoming disillusioned with what life was like pre-pandemic
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.320]   and having the disruption give them the space
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.200]   to think about it.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.960]   That's a direction I think a lot of people
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.600]   should consider, which is this hardcore deep life direction.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.760]   Radical changes to align your life with your values.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.260]   You have to know what you value, be very careful about that,
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.000]   but then make the changes radical.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.320]   So don't do radical for the sake of radical.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.720]   You should be very aligned clearly with your values.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.680]   And why not?
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.080]   I mean, Barry did it.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.400]   He has an interesting life out there.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.520]   So I think we need to move this podcast to a farm.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.320]   I want video.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.040]   We should be on horses.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.280]   I think we should be on horses as we do the podcast.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.240]   Here's an AV challenge for our contractors.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.680]   We want to record this podcast from horses.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.440]   We're just sort of walking over our land
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.280]   and sort of chatting about life.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   We can do that the 201st episode because the 200th episode
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:33.780]   will--
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.960]   We're going to South Africa.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.320]   And then after our treatment for black mamba venom,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.360]   we'll go to a farm.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.280]   We'll do this from a farm, and then we'll get the next headline.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.880]   Minor podcaster hilariously bit by mamba in South Africa,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.000]   immediately trampled by horses on farm,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.320]   ruining the land and the financial future
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.320]   of the landowner, Wendell Barry, who has now
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.960]   been forced to move to New York to become a TikTok
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.360]   influencer in hopes of salvaging his waning fortune.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.240]   It's a long headline.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.720]   And he couldn't pack his typewriter.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.000]   Yeah, couldn't pack his typewriter.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.240]   So now is using virtual reality goggles
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.920]   and living mainly in the metaverse.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   And it's all going to happen.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.240]   It's a long headline.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.800]   The headlines are long these days.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.500]   You have to-- because you've got to pack
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.480]   a lot of information into them.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.000]   Oh, well.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.360]   All right.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.200]   Well, enough of that nonsense.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.280]   We got calls today, right?
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.920]   So we got to--
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.240]   Yeah, we got some good calls.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   Listener call episode.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.640]   (upbeat music)
