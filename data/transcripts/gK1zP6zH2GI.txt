[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   We're just a few days from Christmas now and no doubt many last minute presents are being
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.560]   purchased and shipped and wrapped as we speak and perhaps your multitasking gifts as you
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.400]   listen to this podcast. Of course, this is the biggest holiday in the States, at least
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.000]   for giving and receiving gifts. And I just read that the average American shopper will
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.520]   drop a thousand bucks on gifts this Christmas season, which is incredible. And of course,
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.400]   you can send your gifts to Pastor John and me at 2112 Broadway Street. I'm joking, don't
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.980]   send us any gifts. Your audience is our gift. But seriously, this leads to a question especially
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.480]   valuable now and it's from a podcast listener named James. Pastor John, hello and thank
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.000]   you for the podcast. I often hear that we are to love God for who he is, not for what
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.680]   he does for us. To love the giver more than the gifts. How can we know that we're doing
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960]   this, especially during Advent and the Christmas season? When I examine my own heart, so much
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.440]   of what I know about God seems to be in relation to what he has done for me, like in the sending
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.720]   of his son in the incarnation. How do I interact with him on the basis of him and not simply
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.160]   on the basis of the gifts he has given to me?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.160]   Well first, I think it is absolutely crucial in pursuing that interaction with God in that
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:36.280]   way to get really clear in our mind and in our heart that there is a huge and important
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:45.840]   difference between enjoying a person who gives gifts and enjoying the gifts instead of the
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.120]   person or more than the person. And I think we need to clarify this and get it fixed in
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.680]   our minds, both from experience and from Scripture. Let me give you an example of what I mean
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.000]   from experience. What if you give an engagement ring? So you've been in love for two years
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.560]   maybe and now you're going to move this thing decisively forward. You give a ring, I'm assuming
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.080]   you're a man, but gals, you apply it in an appropriate way. You give your fiancÃ© a beautiful
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.200]   diamond ring, and she spends the rest of the night and then the following weeks bragging
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.560]   about this gift, taking it, showing it to everybody. She never calls you, she never
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.120]   looks at you, she never takes you by the hand and looks you in the eye. She's just thrilled
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.120]   with this diamond and your intent in giving her that was totally missed. How would you
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.080]   feel about that? You wanted her to look at it. Oh yes, you wanted her to love it. You
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.320]   wanted her to be thankful for it. You wanted her to enjoy it. And then you wanted her to
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:15.000]   put it on her hand, take your hands across the table, and look you in the eye and say,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   "I would love to spend the rest of my life with you. You are 10,000 times more precious
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.240]   to me than this beautiful ring." We understand from our own experience what it means when
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.160]   gifts are loved more than the giver. We get that. There's no excuse for not getting
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.480]   that. We get it in our experience. Then we get it from the Bible when it comes to God,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.000]   because it's all over the place. So 1 Peter 3, 18, "Christ also suffered once for sins,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.120]   the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God." That's why he died,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   bringing us to God. Or Romans 5, 11, after saying that we rejoice in the hope of the
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.440]   glory of God and we rejoice in tribulation, then he adds this in verse 11 of Romans 5,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.960]   "More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.640]   we have now received reconciliation." Or Psalm 16, 11, "You make known to me the
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.520]   path of life. In your presence there is fullness of joy." In your presence, fullness of joy.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.880]   "At your right hand, pleasures forevermore." Or Psalm 73, 25, "Whom have I in heaven
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.600]   but you? There's nothing on earth I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.640]   but you are the strength of my heart and my portion forever." Or the story of the 10
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:59.560]   lepers healed by Jesus in Luke 17. Remember, all 10, no leprosy, awesome, healed, run away,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:08.840]   one of them, a Samaritan, comes back praising God and falling down at Jesus' feet. What's
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.560]   the point? The point is, they missed it. They just missed it. This is about Jesus, this
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:24.280]   is about God. Leprosy deliverance was a means to that end. So we know from experience, we
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.160]   know from the scriptures that there's a difference between enjoying a giver through
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.440]   his gifts and enjoying gifts instead of the giver. We know that, we get that. We know
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:46.000]   that the goal of all God does for us is designed to make it possible for us to be with him
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.680]   and him to be with us, does everything for us to be with us as our all-satisfying treasure
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:03.540]   and father and friend and savior. Getting that clear is the key, I think, to experiencing
[00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:11.920]   God in and through all his gifts. And here's one more key to help us experience God this
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.940]   way during Christmas season. We should realize that every gift, every good thing that comes
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.200]   into our lives of any kind as a token of God's everlasting kindness, all of it, all of it
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.840]   was bought by the sacrifice of Jesus, the blood of Jesus. Here's the logic of Romans
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.720]   8:32, "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:49.480]   with him graciously give us all things?" So all things are coming to us as believers
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.600]   because he didn't spare his son. Here's the effect this has. All giving and getting,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.320]   especially at Christmas time, becomes a reminder of the death of Jesus. Now what effect does
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   that have? What effect does God intend for his son's death to have on us when we think
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:20.240]   this way? On the one hand, Christ is the Father's indescribable gift, Romans 8:32 and 2 Corinthians
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.520]   9, 15, and Christ is his own gift. Over and over the New Testament says, "Christ gave
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.280]   himself, Christ gave himself." Matthew 10, 45, Galatians 1, 4, Galatians 2, 20, Ephesians
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.120]   5, 2, Ephesians 5, 25, 1 Timothy 2, 6, Titus 2, 4, Christ gave, gave, gave himself. Think
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:53.720]   of it. If God gives his son and the son gives himself for you and to you, it doesn't even
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:00.800]   make sense to say we love the gift more than the giver. The gift is the giver. The giver
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:09.520]   is the gift. So since every gift shared at Christmas time is possible only because of
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:17.240]   the death of Christ for us, and thus directs our attention to the death of Christ, therefore
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:29.800]   every gift takes us through the cross to the gift who is the giver. Or, here's the other
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:37.000]   way of seeing it. In Romans 5, 8, Paul says, "God shows his love for us in that while we
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.880]   were still sinners, Christ died for us." So behind every gift that we get or give at
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.480]   Christmas time is the death of Christ, and that means that every gift is the overflow
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   of the gift of God's love, because that's what he shows when Christ dies. When you think
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   of God's love, it is inseparable from himself. When John Piper talks about enjoying God,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.400]   I don't mean, "Oh, but you can't enjoy his love." In a sense, his love is not a gift.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   It is what he is. When real love binds two persons together, they don't say, "Hey, where's
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   the gift?" They say, "You're the gift. You're the gift. You are my love. Your love is yourself
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.640]   given to me." So it seems to me that Romans 8, 32 is the key to Christmas God-centeredness
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.680]   in giving and getting gifts. Every good in our life as Christians is owing to the death
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:48.360]   of Jesus, according to the logic of Romans 8, 32. And that death is the gift of God himself
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:56.700]   for our everlasting joy, and the gift of God's love, which is also the giving of himself
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.700]   to us.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:05.620]   Amen. What a great season to meditate on this precious fact that the gift is the giver,
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.420]   and the giver is the gift that is so precious. Pastor John, thank you. And thank you for
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.140]   preaching this message year-round, not just seasonally. I appreciate that about you. And
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:21.600]   James, thanks for this very excellent question. Well, Christmas anticipation is very thick.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.840]   It's getting thicker as Christmas music is on the radio, and the smells of pumpkin spice
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:35.260]   are in the air, and the beautiful lights brighten the dark night sky. And in less than one week,
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:41.420]   Christmas will all be over. All the gifts will be unwrapped. They'll be worn or played
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.740]   with or returned to the store for cash or credit. Trees and lights will come down. We'll
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:52.100]   put them back into the attic. And it seems to happen every year. There's a subtle sense,
[00:10:52.100 --> 00:11:00.060]   a little pang of letdown. Something tells us that the hype never quite matched the buildup.
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.940]   What explains that sensation each year that many of us feel? That's the question that
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.260]   we're going to look at on Friday. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.420]   the Ask Pastor John podcast with pastor and author John Piper. We'll see you next time.
