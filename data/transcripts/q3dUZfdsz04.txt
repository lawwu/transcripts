[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   So if you're really trying to use your spend to get Delta status,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.240]   getting multiple Delta cards to get multiple headstarts
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.480]   and then spending on the reserve cards is going to be your best way to do it.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.620]   But I would push back and say at some point,
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.440]   if you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a Delta card
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.560]   to try to get Delta status,
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.300]   you got to ask yourself what the opportunity cost of that spend is.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.480]   And I went through an email exchange with someone who was asking me about this.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.400]   And it turns out that by not using, let's say, a 2.625% cashback card,
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.480]   they were effectively spending $4,000 on Delta status each year
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.160]   to try to get all the way to Delta Diamond.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.580]   If you think that that's worth it
[00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.640]   and you understand the benefits and the perks, awesome.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.560]   But if you're actually thinking, wow, I don't fly Delta that often.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.380]   If I just took that $4,000 and just paid for Comfort Plus
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.280]   or paid for business class, I'd probably be a lot happier.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.700]   And maybe I wouldn't even fly Delta all the time.
