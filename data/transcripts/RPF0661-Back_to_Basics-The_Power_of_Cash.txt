It's very unusual for somebody to pull out their wallet and pull out a $20 bill. Generally, I'm the only one who does that. And I don't do it all the time. Sometimes I run out of money. But generally, if there is somebody who does it, I'm usually the only one who does it. And there are a number of arguments that people present. There are a number of arguments that many of my friends would give as to why they use a credit card for everything that they do.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:43.060]   and some of them really make a lot of sense. For example, a lot of people would say, well, I like to use my debit card because then I can track how much money I'm spending. It's very easy. Most of our banks have some kind of built-in software where they analyze the transactions in our account. And so we can look at the end of the month and we can kind of see, hey, here's where all my money went. Or perhaps you're using some online tool such as Mint or using YNAB or something like that.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:06:11.720]   Or perhaps you're using some other piece of software and all your transactions are automatically imported from your credit card and automatically categorized because of all the rules that you have. And so you can pull up a nifty little spreadsheet and show exactly how much money you're spending. That's a reasonable thing. A lot of people use credit cards and debit cards simply because they're convenient. They don't have to worry about making sure they have enough money in their pocket. They don't have to worry about going to an ATM machine and taking cash out. And so they just like the convenience of it. And so I think it's a great way to do that.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.740]   That's a great way to do that.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.740]   That's a great way to do that.

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:41.620]  actively. You can't just use a card to pay for your credit cards. But here is what I observed at one point in time in my own life when I used to make those arguments and exclusively use digital forms of plastic cards for my spending mechanisms. I wasn't actually getting ahead. I wasn't actually making much progress with regard to building wealth. And if I had to do an informal survey of many people, I would say that many people feel the same way. If I were to look at five or six people, I would say that many people feel the same way.

[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   If you have a mortgage payment, you can't pay a mortgage payment in cash.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   Maybe, well, maybe there's an exception.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   Unless perhaps your mortgage is drawn with your local bank that you physically can go in and you can physically make a mortgage plan.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   That's a good example.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   But if you have a mortgage,
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:34.380]   you can't pay a mortgage payment in cash.

You can take your cash and you can turn it into physical paper money or a check that you could then put in an envelope and send off to your mortgage company. Is that a hassle? Certainly. I don't think that most people need to do something like that for an ongoing period of time. But if somebody is trying to turn their life around and they're doing what I described, they're learning how to budget, I would be thrilled to see somebody who's deep in debt not budgeting
