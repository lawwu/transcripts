[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.520]   It's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:09.600]   And in this episode, I want to talk about the 2023 housing price forecast.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.640]   There are definitely more bears than bulls, and I am one of them.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.960]   But don't worry, I don't think it's gonna be that bad.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960]   But I don't think prices are going to go up.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.600]   So the 2023 housing price forecast range from down 22% to up 5.4%.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.080]   So there's no consensus, but the bias is towards the downside.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.200]   There's also the issue of forecasting the national median home price and the price of
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.520]   your local housing market.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.240]   While we care about the national median home price forecast, we care way more about our
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.880]   local housing market forecast.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.560]   Personally, if I'm looking at buying houses in 2023, I'm looking for house prices that
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.600]   are trading at least 10% off its high.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.160]   And I'm also looking for deals where, you know, maybe the sellers have to relocate to
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.660]   another part of the country or another part of the world.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.720]   So they're more motivated to sell.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.240]   This is especially true if you're listing during the winter.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960]   Or maybe the sellers are trying to sell because they went through a divorce and they just
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.320]   really couldn't care less about maximizing prices.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.220]   And they just want to get rid of another asset, simplify life and split the proceeds.
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.920]   There are always opportunities out there, folks.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240]   You just have to make the effort to go search for them.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.040]   For background, I expected the median sales price in the United States to rise by 8 to
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.360]   10% in 2022.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   My estimate was less bullish than the majority of firms expecting closer to 12 to 18% price
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.400]   increases.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   So in the fourth quarter of 2021, according to the St. Louis Fred, the median home price
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.320]   was $423,600.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.020]   The latest pricing data available third quarter 2022 shows the median home price of $454,900
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.240]   or a 7.4% increase.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.880]   So that's pretty close.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.200]   What I obviously underestimated was the rise in mortgage rates.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.980]   I did not expect mortgage rates to break five, five and a half percent.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.440]   They went all the way up to 7% for the average 30 year fixed rate mortgage.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   And that was a surprise.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.720]   Obviously, that's going to put the brakes on the housing market.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.360]   However, the median home price still went up about 7.4%.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.060]   We'll see what the fourth quarter 2022 housing price data will be.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.920]   And that'll come out in the first quarter of 2023.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.220]   I would think the price would decline a little bit in the fourth quarter of 2022.
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.280]   But let's just wait and see.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.920]   Now on to the house price forecast.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.640]   On the most bearish end, we've got John Burns Real Estate Consulting down 20 to 22%.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.080]   Zonda down 10%.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.640]   Goldman Sachs down 5 to 10%.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.680]   Redfin down 4%.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.760]   The most bullish housing price forecast for 2023, Realtor.com plus 5.4%.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.360]   CoreLogic up 4.1%.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   And the National Association of Realtors up 1.2%.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.800]   And then there's a bunch of other forecasts like from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, basically
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.480]   plus or minus 1%.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.100]   And it's just not very exciting.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.160]   So I wanted to focus on the most bearish call and the most bullish call.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.240]   When you're doing forecasts, you want to look at the tail ends to see who's delusional and
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.440]   what you're missing.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.360]   Because every one of us who has money at stake in the real estate market, stock market, any
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.120]   risk asset needs to have a thesis.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.760]   We need to understand where things are going so we can better prepare and make more optimal
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760]   decisions.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.520]   That's the whole theme of buy this, not that, how to spend your way to wealth and freedom.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.800]   The more optimal decisions we can make over time, the wealthier we will get and the happier
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.040]   we will be.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.520]   So the most bearish call is by John Burns Real Estate Consulting.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   I like their work.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.520]   I've sourced their data in many posts before.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.320]   Good data, good stuff.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.460]   However, seeing a 20 to 22% decline in house prices in 2023 is way too pessimistic.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.120]   That would bring the national median home price to about $364,000.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.880]   A 20 to 22% price decline would mean a greater decline than the one during the global financial
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.560]   crisis.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.200]   Back in the first quarter of 2007, the median home price was $257,000.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.280]   And it declined to $208,400 in the first quarter of 2009.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.160]   So that's an 18.9% decline.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.140]   And that took two years for national median home prices to decline by 18.9%.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.960]   So for John Burns Real Estate Consulting to say that home prices will decline by a greater
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.400]   amount in half the time is completely off.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.160]   I don't understand where they're getting this forecast from.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.920]   The data is not that bad.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.440]   Credit standards are much higher than they were before the 2008 crisis.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:14.400]   We all know anybody who's bought a home since 2008 and since 2012 know how difficult it's
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520]   been to get a mortgage.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.900]   The average credit score for a successful mortgage applicant is over 720.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.080]   Before that global financial crisis in 2008, the average credit score was in the 600s,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.340]   by 600s.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.880]   So the credit quality of mortgage borrowers is much higher.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.240]   Meanwhile, the vast majority of homeowners locked in mortgage rates below 5%.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.840]   It's like 95% of mortgage, people who have mortgages are at 5% or lower.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.140]   And further, a great percentage of homeowners just simply don't have a mortgage at all.
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.240]   If you want to forecast house price declines, one way is to think how bad is the current
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.280]   environment versus the environment in 2007, 2008, 2009.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   And if we say the current environment is let's say half as bad, well, the price decline would
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.160]   be half of 18.9%.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.760]   So we'd say something like 9.9%.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.480]   We could say that, but I don't think this current environment is half as bad.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.180]   Maybe a third as bad, 30% as bad.
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.600]   So we could see a 5.7% house price decline.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   This is just one way of thinking about potential declines in 2023.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.400]   But the thing is, as I just summarized, there is a 5.4% housing price forecast by realtor.com.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.640]   That's the most bullish call.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.200]   And I think it's absolutely wrong.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.880]   Realtor.com is a website that helps you find a realtor to buy or sell a home.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.720]   I remember looking on realtor.com to look for homes in Hawaii, when I've been searching
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.440]   for the past three to four years.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.340]   And they put me together with a realtor, and then the realtor pays a referral fee.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.880]   So the stronger the housing market, the more business realtor.com will generate.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.900]   And I don't think it's a coincidence that CoreLogic, expecting 4.1% increase, the National
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.700]   Association of Realtors expecting a positive 1.2% increase, the Mortgage Bankers Association
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:22.920]   expecting a 0.7% increase, and Zillow expecting a 0.8% increase are all bullish and are all
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.800]   part of the real estate industry.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.480]   Now the outlier to the bullish calls is Redfin.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.840]   Redfin is obviously a real estate company, and they're expecting down 4%.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.520]   But Redfin, my gosh, have you seen the stock price of Redfin?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.120]   It's similar to Zillow.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:47.800]   The stock is down a whopping 85% year to date, because it too went into the institutional
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.640]   eye buying business, lost a lot of money, and volume is way down because everybody's
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.260]   taking a wait and see approach.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.600]   If you're a seller, you've got a low mortgage rate, you're just waiting and seeing how things
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   are going to turn out, whether mortgage rates are going to come down and demand is going
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.700]   to come back.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.440]   And if you're a buyer, well, you're waiting to see if mortgage rates are coming down.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.800]   And you're waiting to see if there are better deals ahead.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.040]   All right, so here's my forecast with a 75% conviction level, pretty high.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:24.520]   I expect the median housing price for 2023 to decline by 8% to $419,000 if we assume
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.320]   home prices and 2022 at about $455,000.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.520]   And the reasons include one a global recession by the end of 2023, thanks to the Fed, the
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.840]   Fed insisting on hiking to a 5 to 5.125% terminal rate, even though inflation is clearly declining
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:50.280]   and annualizing under 2% now, three, the inescapable correlation between risk assets as the S&P
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.560]   500 goes nowhere in 2023.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.720]   Again, real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 25% in 2022.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.240]   Finally, a higher risk free rate makes investing in risk assets less appealing.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.640]   I talked about how I'm actively investing over 60% of my cash flow and cash into short
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.880]   term Treasury bonds, three months, six months, nine months, one year, I like one year especially,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.960]   because you could have got 4.7%.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.380]   Now it's like 4.55%.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:27.260]   And that looks amazing, compared to the 10 year bond yield now at only 3.45%.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.440]   So that yield curve inversion is completely out of whack.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   And it's telling the Fed to stop.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.240]   And if the Fed doesn't stop, you know, it just doesn't seem like that based on its recent
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.560]   December 14 discussion saying, oh, the terminal rate, we think should be at 5.125%.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.200]   I mean, where did that come from?
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.480]   We're all expecting 5%.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.400]   And many of us were hoping lower given October and November inflation data that came out
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.060]   in November and December were below expectations.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.600]   Now I know down 8% isn't great.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   It's disappointing.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.440]   We always want to make money.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.760]   But look, real estate has outperformed the S&P 500 by a lot in 2022.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.520]   And real estate prices have gone up a lot since 2020.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.000]   So giving back 8% is not that bad.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.040]   I think it's actually pretty healthy.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.960]   You want that froth to get out of the system.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.720]   You want more people with great credit scores and great down payments to be able to afford
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.120]   comfortably afford to buy property, hopefully using my 30/30, three to five home buying
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.240]   rule.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.880]   You want a greater and greater percentage of the population to be able to comfortably
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   afford homes and have home buying security.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.680]   That's great for society.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.600]   And it's great for a stable economy.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:52.140]   Crazy home price increases of 20/30% a year, completely unhealthy.
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.280]   So I'm kind of glad that the froth is out of the system.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.520]   Now here are reasons why I don't expect home prices to decline by much more than 8% in
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   2023.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.200]   One, 30 year fixed rate mortgages should decline by two to 3% from their peak of 7% by mid
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.280]   2023.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.400]   I'm looking at this chart, which is in the post if you click through that shows how mortgage
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:29.920]   purchase applications rose by 13.8% in December, after mortgage rates fell from 7.08% to 6.3%.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.320]   The 6.3% sound great.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.240]   I mean, it sounds okay, but it's pretty high compared to a year ago.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.620]   However, there was a huge uptick.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:47.220]   So the elasticity of demand for homes when mortgage rates fall is very, very high.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.720]   And if that's the case, if mortgage rates do indeed decline to let's say an average
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:59.000]   of four to 5%, that pickup in demand could be greater than 25%, maybe 30%.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.260]   And the longer there's this inactivity in the real estate market, the more pent up demand
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.260]   there will be.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:12.920]   So if you have pent up demand plus lower mortgage rates, I don't know, maybe my 8% downside
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.800]   scenario is too bearish.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.760]   Another reason why I don't expect home prices to decline by much more than 8% the Treasury
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.600]   bond market has stopped listening to the Fed.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.640]   The 10 year bond yield did not move at all after the Fed raised by another 50 basis points
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.560]   on December 14, 2022.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.320]   So we're now at 4.25 to 4.5% on the Fed funds rate.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.120]   And the yield curve is hugely inverted.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.720]   And thankfully, the 10 year Treasury bond is what dictates mortgage rates.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.080]   More so than the Fed funds rate.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.600]   All right.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.360]   Consumers still have excess savings, thanks to tremendous stimulus spending in 2020 and
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.580]   2021.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.240]   That excess savings is getting spent for sure, but we still got it.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.460]   Another positive data point, there will still be a continued under supply of homes.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.360]   The vast majority of homeowners have a 30 year fixed rate under 5%.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.960]   Therefore, there's really no need for most to sell.
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.560]   And if you look at the post and you look at the inventory chart, we're still like 30,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.960]   40% below 2015 to 2020 averages, 2019 averages.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.860]   So we still got a ways to go to get back to that normalized demand supply scenario.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:39.080]   More reasons why home prices won't decline by more than 8% there will be a continued
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:45.480]   capital shift towards real assets and away from funny money assets like stocks, cryptocurrencies
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.300]   and anything else that provides zero utility.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.920]   This is a theme that I've been discussing since I started Financial Samurai in 2009,
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.160]   because I saw funny money blow up in people's faces back in 2000.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.700]   One minute you are worth 2 million and you were going to quit your job and the next minute
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.640]   you lost it all and had a huge tax bill and you got to go back to work with your tail
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.320]   between your legs.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.240]   I think this is another really big long term trend where more and more capital will be
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:21.960]   converted into real assets that hold its value better, that provides utility and that provides
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   joy.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.160]   Finally, there's this great chart in the post that highlights how much home equity has been
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.600]   built over the years, especially since 2012.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.960]   Once home prices started going up again, that amount of equity compared to the amount of
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.680]   debt is huge.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.880]   It's much larger than the amount of equity compared to the amount of debt back in 2006
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.360]   and 2007.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:57.040]   Back in 2006-2007, the spread was it looks like around $5 trillion.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.000]   There's $5 trillion more in home equity than in home debt.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.320]   Now, the spread is let's say, let's see $32 trillion in home equity minus about $12 trillion
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.840]   in home debt.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.680]   So the simple math states that there is a $20 trillion difference between equity and
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:26.320]   debt in 2022 versus only a $5 trillion difference buffer in about 2006-2007.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:33.280]   In other words, the average or median homeowner can withstand economic shock much greater
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.880]   than the ones 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:43.840]   So there you have it, my thoughts and everybody else's thoughts about house price forecasts
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   in 2023.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.280]   I do want to conclude by saying that I had a really great hour long conversation with
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.200]   Ben Miller, CEO of Fundrise on Friday.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   We more or less agree with most of my points in my 2023 housing price forecast post.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.680]   What I did learn, however, was their Sunbelt properties are continuing to see 5% plus rent
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.400]   price growth, which will help negate price declines.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.960]   Therefore, if you're a fund investor, I would expect continued outperformance actually,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.480]   if you have a fund that is investing in the heartland of America real estate.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.360]   The main question I wanted to ask Ben was with availability of 4% plus risk free returns
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.680]   through treasury bonds, what should investors be doing in real estate?
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.480]   And he said, look at credit opportunities, credit funds.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.880]   So Fundrise's fixed income fund, for example, is yielding 8% after fees.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.640]   He also mentioned there are some deals because they've declined in price where they're trying
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   to take advantage and whose yields are at 12 to 14% as they find more opportunity.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.440]   In terms of timing, we both agreed summer could provide some of the best buying opportunities.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.920]   But it was interesting because he was kind of surprised that I agreed with him on the
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.920]   summer.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.880]   So then he started thinking, well, maybe he should start being more aggressive and looking
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.680]   earlier in the year because we're both thinking summer's the time.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   And if we're both thinking summer's the time, other people are thinking summer's the time.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.720]   And then if everybody's thinking summer's the time to really pounce, then will it really
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   happen?
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.760]   It probably won't.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.960]   And my thesis on why summer could be a great time is because I think mortgage rates will
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   decline by 2 to 3% by say June 2023.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   And with pent up demand, and hopefully a Fed that pivots a little, I think after, you know,
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:45.560]   any desperation selling there is during the winter, demand could rebound relatively quickly.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.280]   And it's interesting with all risk assets, whether it's stocks, real estate, and especially
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.200]   cryptocurrencies, is that there's tremendous amount of FOMO where we don't want to miss
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.060]   out on that rebound.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.680]   So many of us, many investors just nibble, nibble, nibble on the way down and try to
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.280]   time it so we go all in once there's that inflection point.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.200]   But as we all know, it's very hard to time.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.760]   I really appreciate my call with Ben Miller, founder of Fundrise, because we had a call
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.520]   at the beginning of 2022.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.240]   And he said he believed inflation was going to go beyond 8% and the Fed was going to hike
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.640]   aggressively.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.380]   I didn't think that.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.360]   And so he has been spot on.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.320]   And it's always great to see other points of view.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.240]   Because again, when we are thinking about the future, we need to look at every single
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.160]   angle to try to make better investment decisions.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.840]   So if you want to invest in Fundrise, you can go to financialsamurai.com/fundrise.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.020]   About 20% of their assets under management is in cash, and they are looking for deals
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.420]   right now.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.760]   And if you have a moment, please spare a positive review on this podcast and for my book on
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.320]   Amazon or wherever you purchased it.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.680]   I haven't worked this hard in a long time over the past couple of weeks.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.480]   And I think partially the reason why is I was sick off and on for two and a half, three
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.660]   months, and I finally got the energy back to do more podcasts and to write more.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:19.000]   And I wanted to utilize my time left to do my best to work my hardest.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.320]   Because who knows when that energy will fade.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.600]   And I do wonder as we approach the end of life, is this what happens?
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.320]   Do we end up doing as much as possible to minimize regret?
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.640]   I think so.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.240]   I hope so.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.080]   Because we are all rational actors in the end.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.840]   And I really hate regret.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.720]   So thank you everyone for your great reviews on this podcast and for my book.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.760]   It helps keep me going no matter how sick and tired I feel.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.960]   For the remainder of the year, I'm going to do a lot of reflecting and thinking about
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:59.720]   how, how to make life better, simpler, more joyful in 2023.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.480]   So thanks for sticking with me all year,
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.440]   and I'll speak to you folks soon.
