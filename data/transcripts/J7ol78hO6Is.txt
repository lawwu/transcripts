[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.320]   Welcome back Portfolio Rescue, as always I am joined by producer extraordinaire Duncan
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   Hill.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.440]   Duncan, last week the show was a little downer, I think, we had a lot of recession talk, and
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   basically the idea was history has shown that the only way to get inflation down from current
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.000]   levels of like 8%, really high inflation, is to see a recession to pull that back.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.080]   So let's play one of my favorite Austin Powers clips before we get into what I'm going to
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.080]   say here.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.960]   "Allow myself to introduce myself."
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.000]   Alright, so allow myself to contradict my self.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.520]   So I don't know if we're going to go into a recession, I was laying out the historical
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.880]   precedent for it, but let me contradict my self on this one.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.560]   So consumers could cut back in the face of higher inflation, right?
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.640]   Higher costs mean I'm going to spend less on certain items, they could pull it back,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.600]   or they could lever up and borrow or spend down their savings.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.520]   If you think about it, inflation has really only been above trend, and I call trend 3%
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.680]   or so, which is what it's been for the last 100 years, since last April.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040]   So we're talking about a year with high inflation, higher than average inflation.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   Let me share some anecdotes from this week, see if this sounds inflationary to you.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   Delta's CEO this week said that they had the busiest two days of history for sales
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.640]   for the airline, ever.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.640]   Ever.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400]   Busiest two days ever for sales.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400]   My Disney trip a few weeks ago just slammed with people.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600]   Ever since I started talking about that trip, I've been getting some tips and stuff from
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.180]   my DMs and email from Disney insiders.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.920]   They said in March they think the park could have its biggest week ever.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920]   Ever.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.560]   Places are packed.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.760]   And let me tell you, inflation at Disney, if you think inflation is bad everywhere else,
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   it's in the stratosphere there.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.040]   Here's what people do not care.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   When we got back from Disney, we were kind of on the fence about doing something for
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.000]   spring break in April, and right when we got back from Disney, we said, "All right, let's
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   book a trip."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Basically, the entire state of Florida was sold out.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.580]   Obviously, we waited a little too long, but there was nothing.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.680]   No hotels, no resorts, no Airbnbs.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.160]   Those are just kind of minor anecdotes.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.280]   The housing market is still on fire.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.200]   Two-thirds of Americans own a home, right?
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.480]   And rates are going up, right?
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Mortgage rates.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.840]   If you bought a home before the last year or so, you've built up a ton of wealth in
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   your house.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.620]   My point is, there's a ton of pent-up demand from the pandemic.
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.280]   Consumers have spent the last two years repairing their balance sheets, paying down debt, building
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.200]   up savings.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.760]   What if inflation is just this thing that was caused by exogenous shocks like the pandemic
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.880]   and a war?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.520]   What if those things kind of improve in a couple months?
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   I still believe the probability of a recession is higher today than it was a month ago, but
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.120]   I'm not 100% certain about that.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.000]   I know we'll see one at some point, but I don't know.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   When will it be?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.380]   Jerome Powell yesterday, my colleague at the Fed, said the probability of a recession in
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.440]   the next year is not particularly elevated.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.440]   So I don't know.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   Is it this year, next year, four years from now?
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.960]   I honestly have no idea.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.040]   I do know that this is the craziest macro environment I've ever seen.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.240]   So if anyone tells you who knows how this is going to play out and a recession is going
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.880]   to start here or not going to start here, they're either delusional or lying because
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.360]   no one really knows, especially with the setup we're going through.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.720]   So that's where I am, and I know we're going to talk about recession talk today on the
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.160]   show again because we had some questions to follow up from this.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.680]   I saw someone in the comments on Animal Spirits telling you guys that Kiyosaki turned out
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680]   to be right.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.020]   I think they were being serious.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.360]   All right, so that's where I am on recession talk.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.520]   So let's get into the first one because I know some people in the comments last week
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.000]   were asking after I kind of gave a little doom and gloom.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So where are we at?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.920]   Yeah, I love the first one here.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.360]   We're starting off with a super, super brief one.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.240]   So first up we have what are some of the moves you're making to prepare for the recession?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   And they're saying it like it's a foregone conclusion, right?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   The recession.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.000]   I think this was a comment actually last week on last week's show from YouTube, so we're
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.520]   getting some good questions in there.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.840]   Let's do a little recession history lesson.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.680]   So John, give me a chart on of the dates for recessions here.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.320]   So this is since World War II, so we're talking about the last, call it 80 years.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.280]   We've had 13 recessions.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.960]   That means you have one every five and a half or six years.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.640]   Now, of course, that's on average.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.600]   That's not, it doesn't come on a schedule like the train, although Duncan, it sounds
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   like your train.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.500]   The schedule doesn't really matter.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.920]   So again, every five and a half or six years now, even though we just had one in 2020,
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.800]   you think, okay, it's going to be a while, but there have been recessions that happened
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.320]   pretty quickly, you know, back to back.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.160]   So there was one that happened in the late 1950s and it happened again in 1916.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.120]   There was a recession started in 1980, and it was six months long.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.600]   Then in 1981, we had another one again, that was actually caused by the Fed to get rid
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.040]   of recession or to get rid of inflation, ironically.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.120]   So it's not out of the question to have them relatively quickly in succession with one
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.760]   another, but even if we don't go into recession this year or next year, eventually it's going
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.400]   to happen.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.640]   But I think preparing for recession is not what people think.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.480]   Duncan, remember last week you asked me, when you got hit in a football game, was it better
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.080]   to know it was coming or be blindsided so you could tense up, right?
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.720]   I think that idea of tensing up is actually worse when you're thinking about a recession.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.600]   So Peter Lynch had his quote where he said that far more money has been lost by investors
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.960]   preparing for corrections, trying to anticipate them, than lost in the corrections themselves,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   right?
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   And I think the same is true of recessions.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   How do you prepare for one?
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.880]   The same way you prepare your finances for anything else.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.120]   I don't think you change your portfolio because you think a recession is coming.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.760]   You create a portfolio that's durable enough to handle a recession because you know it's
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   going to happen at some point.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.640]   And the other thing is, if you had the headline, "Recession is going to start in June of 2023,"
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   even knowing that date, the idea of when to time your portfolio to get out of the market
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.800]   and then get back in, the timing on this stuff is really difficult because guess what the
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.360]   stock market is for looking?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.400]   It could go into a bear market before a recession happens.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.560]   It could not even go into a bear market because the government's going to step in.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   Who knows?
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.080]   How else do you prepare?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.880]   A high savings rate is always a good cushion.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.720]   But do you do that because of a recession or because having a high savings rate is good
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   for you regardless?
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.320]   You do it because it's good regardless.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.680]   You have an emergency savings fund.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.420]   God forbid you lose your job, right?
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.440]   And the other thing is, we're talking about recessions like a contraction in GDP.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.400]   You could always have a personal recession that has nothing to do with the economy having
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   a contraction.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   You could lose your job.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.200]   You could incur a huge expense because you have a big medical expense.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.400]   You have something wrong with your house.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.220]   You have a tree fall off your house, whatever.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.320]   Your car breaks down.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.320]   You could lose money on a bad investment.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.240]   Plenty of people have lost 60 or 70% of their money investing in tech stocks in the last
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.240]   few years.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   And guess what?
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   There hasn't been a recession.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   They just lost that money.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.000]   So what am I personally doing to prepare for a recession?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.840]   The same thing I'm doing outside of a recession.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   I'm saving money.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   I'm automating my investments.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.840]   I'm spending on things that matter to me.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.600]   I'm keeping my credit score up by paying down my bills.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.880]   I'm only carrying intelligent debt, like mortgage and my home equity line of credit.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.320]   And I'm making sure my credit score is up to snuff if I want to borrow some more money.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   Here's what I'm not doing.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   I'm not changing my portfolio because I think a recession is coming.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.400]   I'm not burying gold bars in the backyard.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   I think the idea of trying to time this stuff, it sounds intelligent and it's like, I should
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   prepare.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   I should get ready.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.320]   But you should always have your finances prepared for a recession, whether it's the economy
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.880]   itself going into a tailspin, or your local economy, or your personal circumstances, right?
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.400]   So I think you just build that into your plan that something is going to go wrong eventually.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.720]   You just don't know when.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.120]   If not your backyard, where are you burying your gold?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.040]   No, just kidding.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.280]   I keep my gold on the blockchain these days, actually.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   That's safer.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   All right.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   Let's do another one.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   Okay.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.560]   So up next we have a question from Jeff, who writes, "You guys often say that down markets
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.360]   are good for young investors with long time horizons, but can't they be good for early
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.480]   and regular retirees too?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.040]   If I have a 60/40 portfolio with comfortably on a 3% withdrawal and have two years in cash
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   to ride out a down market, can't my yearly rebalance help me buy low?
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.920]   I'm hoping to have a 40-year retirement and I'm 15 years away from max social security.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.100]   Ben wrote a great post, as usual, on sequence risk, and by withdrawing from either my stocks
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.040]   or bonds for expenses and rebalancing, depending on what's up or down, a retiree can do fine.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.200]   It seems like a down market could be my friend too."
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.800]   Duncan, we have some very astute viewers here.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.680]   This is a great question and brought up some very good points, right?
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   So I think that a lot of people say, "Why in the world would I own bonds right now?"
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.480]   If bonds are paying 2% for 10-year coverage.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.520]   We've had a lot of those questions over the last months.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   Right.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.900]   So bonds are paying 2%, inflation is at 8%.
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.240]   Why in the world would I ever own bonds?
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.060]   I think there's four reasons to own bonds.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.340]   The first one is that bonds hedge against market volatility, and then for some people
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.080]   that means they hedge emotional volatility.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.600]   So put this chart up here of when bonds outperform stocks, when the stocks fall.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.640]   So this is every year going back to the late 1920s when the stock market fell, and the
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.600]   average down year in the stock market when it's down is about a 13% loss.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.400]   Obviously the range is all over the place.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.680]   But in those years when stocks fall an average of 13%, the bond market is up 5%.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.060]   So this is the S&P 500 in 10-year treasuries.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.480]   So bonds are a great hedge against a falling stock market.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.560]   And guess what you don't want to do when they're falling?
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.560]   Sell your stocks.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.880]   And that's as a retiree, if you don't have savings coming in anymore, you don't have
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.760]   that human capital anymore, you're gonna have to spend your portfolio down.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   So you don't want to sell your stocks when they're down and have a double whammy of stock
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.880]   losses and selling.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.240]   You have those bonds for that stabilizer.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.760]   And actually I looked at this, the only time that both were down in the same year, it's
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.080]   happened four times previously, 1931, 1941, 1969, and 2018.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.240]   Right now, bonds and stocks are both down this year.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.280]   So 2022 could be the next one.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.280]   It's possible.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.960]   Number two, bonds are a hedge against deflation.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   Deflation sounds like the furthest thing in the world from us right now since inflation
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   is so high.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.680]   Inflation is bad for bonds as a risk over the longterm.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.920]   Deflation is actually, that's why you hold bonds.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.560]   It's actually a good thing because your money's going up that you're being paid back.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.080]   So no one thought inflation was going to happen until the pandemic hit.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.760]   No one right now thinks deflation is going to happen.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.640]   I tell you what, it's going to happen at some point, we don't know when.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.760]   As our listener pointed out here, bonds can be used to rebalance, right?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.520]   So you can either, when stocks fall, you can either spend your money from bonds and leave
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.000]   those stocks alone so they have time to come back.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.200]   Or you can take those bonds, if you're not selling at all, and use it as dry powder.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.080]   The whole point of buying low comes from having some dry powder.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.920]   If you don't have savings anymore and you're a retiree, then bonds are your dry powder.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   And it makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.140]   And of course, you're not going to spend all that 40% down.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.760]   And now let's look at the, so of course, bonds as the spending, let's look why that's going
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   to be the case.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.320]   So let's put up this chart about how long it takes a stock market to break even.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.080]   So this is historical bear markets, again, going back to the 1920s and it goes back to
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   the Great Depression.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.120]   And I looked, how long from the peak of the market to the trough and then break even,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.120]   right?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   How long does it take?
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.620]   And the longest one ever is the Great Depression.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.720]   It took 13 years.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.380]   That's with dividends reinvested.
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.360]   But the average, even including that really long period, was two years, roughly, 2.2 years.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.960]   Take the Great Depression out of there, that long one, that's your worst case scenario.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.440]   It's more like 1.7 years to break even.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.800]   Since 1950, call it more modern times, it's about 1.3 years on average from the time the
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.080]   bear market begins until you make your money back in the stock market.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.620]   And so if you have bonds, that year-long period can seem like it takes forever.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.520]   You don't want to be selling your stocks while they're down, while they're underwater.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.240]   So that's the whole point of bonds, right?
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.600]   And the idea here, this reader said that they have a 3% withdrawal rate, right?
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.720]   I think one way to think about bonds for people in terms of, well, how do I set my asset allocation,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   especially retirement?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.240]   I don't know what's the mix between safe assets and these assets I want to grow, because guess
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.200]   what, you have two, three, four decades left once you retire to still grow your assets.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.960]   So this person has 40% in bonds, they're spending 3% a year.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.420]   Taking out the whole inflationary thing of your spending, that's roughly 13 years of
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.200]   current spending in bonds.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.440]   So that's how much of a buffer that this person has built in to allow stocks to come back.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.400]   And I think that's the idea here, is that bonds can help you offset and not have to
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   sell stocks.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.240]   That's the biggest thing, is you don't want to make a bad situation worse when stocks
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.580]   are down by selling them.
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.060]   And that's what bonds can do.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.700]   And so I think this person, great points, makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.360]   That's kind of how you can think about bonds, though, in the current environment.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.860]   Yeah, good take.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:06.180]   And so up next we have a question that is another long one.
[00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.000]   So this one is, "I've been a long proponent of directing my own investments.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.200]   I do quite a bit of research and use a basic strategy primarily built on utilizing index
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.440]   funds with a splash of diversification into more fun and alternative investments as well.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.480]   As my nest egg gets larger, I'm starting to worry that I'm leaving value on the table
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.600]   by largely ignoring tax strategy beyond funding my 401(k) and trying not to sell assets within
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.880]   the first year.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.120]   I feel really confident in the allocation of my portfolio, but tax strategy seems like
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.880]   a mysterious thing that rich people use to get richer.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   At what point is there enough value to be gained through tax planning to make the cost
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.140]   of an advisor worthwhile?"
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.840]   I have my own little bit of follow-up question, like a noob whale question.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.160]   What exactly do they mean by the cost of an advisor?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.560]   Could you maybe just go over that?
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.460]   I think they're trying to determine when does it make sense to hire an advisor and then
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.840]   bring in some sort of tax planner to help?
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   When is your situation?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.060]   And so I think we're going to talk about that in the answer here.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.160]   So we've talked about this before, Duncan.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.000]   Taxes are one of the biggest question categories we get, by far.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.500]   People hate paying taxes.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:16.400]   So we needed to grow our tax team in the last couple of years, and we put out something
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.120]   on LinkedIn and we said, "Hey, we need someone named Bill, because our other guy, Bill Sweet,
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.120]   we need to keep it the same."
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   So we got another guy named Bill.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.120]   We were so lucky.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   Let's bring him in.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   Bill Artzaronian.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   Hey, Bill.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   Hey, guys.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120]   A tax professional at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.240]   Bill, how do you quantify the idea of tax planning when meeting the clients?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.480]   What is a reason someone can reach out?
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.940]   Because obviously this person is thinking, "My life is getting a little more complicated.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.440]   When does it make sense to talk to a professional and figure out if it makes sense for me?"
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   Right.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.360]   And it is really hard to quantify.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.040]   We can quantify a portfolio through returns, but with tax planning, it's like, "Did I pay
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040]   less tax?"
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.040]   And that's not always the best answer.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.360]   Sometimes, and I'll give you an example of this later, sometimes paying more tax in a
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   given year might be the right decision.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:03.880]   But I've identified three tax events that make tax planning worth it.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.600]   Number one is market events.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.380]   We may be living through one right now, but let's take you back two years, February, March
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.380]   2020.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:18.060]   Aside from having an advisor to help walk you through a 35% drop in the market in 30
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.180]   days, there were tax savings opportunities in that window through tax-loss harvesting,
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.100]   through some other strategies that we can discuss.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.100]   And so these market events come up every couple years.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.260]   If you have a tax plan in place, you're there to take advantage of those.
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.540]   Number two is life events.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:40.100]   So this is marriage, having a child, maybe a career change with equity compensation that
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.060]   you don't quite understand.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:46.180]   Having an advisor or a team around you of professionals makes you more prepared for
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.180]   those types of events.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.940]   And number three is policy changes.
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.020]   And these happen every, maybe twice every decade.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:57.820]   But if you have a team around you to prepare and know your specific situation, these policy
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.380]   events, you can be prepared for them without having to read the legislation.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.020]   Nobody wants to sit through tax documents and read what's new.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.380]   You want to rely on a team of professionals to have you prepared for those moments.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.860]   And maybe you could talk about the difference of hiring a CPA to do a tax return for you
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.260]   versus having an advisor who has a tax element to their firm, right?
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.820]   Because that's two different things as well.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.380]   Historically, these two functions have been totally separate.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.780]   You've had an advisor, you've had a CPA, and they don't really communicate.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.740]   They don't talk to each other.
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.360]   And I've noticed a lot of CPAs and tax professionals out there, they focus on tax and that's it.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.100]   They bang out hundreds of tax returns each year.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.380]   They talk to you once a year, they get you your tax return, they say, "Okay, call me
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.500]   in 10 months, we'll talk again."
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:45.480]   But what we do at RWM and some of our tax offering involves the portfolio, it involves
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.100]   a financial plan and we're now offering tax prep to some of our clients.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.780]   And when you have those two things hand in hand, it makes your financial plan part of
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.580]   the tax planning process and you're able to achieve a lot more.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.780]   And I want to give you a few examples of that.
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:06.820]   We started working with a small business owner in last year, 2021, and maybe I shouldn't
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.820]   say small business owner.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.980]   This is a family that their small business net's $3 million in profit each year.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.780]   And I took a look at their tax return and they were missing out on a huge deduction
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.460]   for small business income.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:23.500]   It's a qualified business income, QBI, it's basically a 20% deduction on the net profit.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.940]   But there are limitations to it.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:31.220]   So this client, their CPA was not planning for these limitations and the CPA would get
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.280]   their information every January, give them a tax return and say, "Cool, that's it."
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.820]   But I looked at the tax return, I said, "All we have to do is make a few very minor changes
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.620]   and we can get you a much, much larger deduction."
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:48.360]   And the total tax savings for this family in 2021 alone was $150,000.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.300]   So that's example one.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.060]   Example two, and this is more common, 150 grand, that's an outlier.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.500]   But more common, you know, we had a family that we were working with that was charitably
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   inclined.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.220]   They were giving away $10,000 to $15,000 a year, but they weren't receiving any tax benefit
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.540]   because they were still under the line between standard deduction and itemized deduction
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.100]   because they didn't have a mortgage, so they weren't itemizing their deductions.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.940]   So they were taking the standard deduction each year while giving away $10,000 to $15,000.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.180]   So what we used is, we used a donor advised fund, which is basically just a middleman
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.180]   in the form of an investment account where you put charitable contributions and then
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.380]   the donor advised fund sends out cash to the charities of your choice.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.940]   And we bunched five years of their charitable contributions into a single year so they could
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.460]   itemize with a large itemized deduction in that first year.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.540]   And then years two, three, four, and five, they were going to take the standard deduction
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.540]   anyway.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.860]   So the total tax savings on this strategy was about $35,000 over that five-year period.
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.660]   And these things will not happen unless you have a team around you that knows what they're
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660]   looking for.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.700]   And these decisions are not made in a vacuum.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.780]   So working with an advisor, working with an advisor with some type of tax background or
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.700]   a professional team who understands your very specific situation, it puts you in a position
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.540]   where you can take advantage of tax planning that you otherwise probably couldn't.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.840]   So yeah, I think your point is like, if you do go to an advisor who does tax planning,
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.500]   the idea is not just they're going to find a bunch of mistakes you've been making.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.820]   It's probably possible that you could find a bunch of stuff you're not even thinking
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   about yet.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.500]   And you haven't even thought to build into the plan and how it works together with the
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.100]   rest of your investments in your portfolio and all those other things, right?
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.220]   It's like this holistic thing where you can look at everything.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.220]   That's right.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.420]   And it may be once every five years that you find something.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.580]   It's not going to, it probably is not going to be an annual thing where you're saving
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.260]   a bunch on taxes because you're working with an advisor, but working with an advisor puts
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:39.740]   you in a position where when the opportunity comes, you're there to strike on it.
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.820]   So I think for this person wanting to know it doesn't make sense, I think it makes sense
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.260]   to reach out to someone and understand what are you going to be able to do for me tax
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.260]   wise?
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.260]   So here's my situation.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.260]   What are you going to do for me?
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.260]   I think so.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.260]   Having that conversation probably makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.260]   All right, Duncan.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.140]   Let's do the next one.
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   Okay.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.140]   I just learned something new.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.140]   Donor Advised Fund.
[00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.580]   That's a new thing I can drop when I'm around finance people so they know I know what I'm
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.580]   talking about.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.580]   DAF.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.580]   Add it to your acronyms.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.580]   Okay.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.020]   So up next we have a question from Gregory who writes, I like this one.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.540]   I got on the ARC train at exactly the wrong time earlier this year.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.300]   I don't believe in it and I'm tired of looking at my portfolio.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.460]   So I'm interested in tax loss harvesting.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.380]   Can you explain tax loss harvesting and how it works?
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.260]   I vaguely get the idea, but I want to make sure I'm selling my losses in the most efficient
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.260]   manner.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.420]   Only in years when I want to offset short term capital gains, does it have to be short
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.860]   against short or long against long?
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.860]   Okay.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.380]   Now this is probably something that a decent amount of people are going through right now
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.380]   if they got into this late.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:43.380]   So as of right now, the ARC Innovation Fund is down 53% from all time highs and that probably
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.940]   is a little more than a year ago.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.780]   So I'm sure a ton of money poured into this one.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.100]   So there's a lot of people thinking right now if I, and I think I like the way that
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.580]   this viewer is thinking about this because they're saying, all right, I don't want to
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   stick with it.
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.060]   I timed it wrong.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.980]   Geez, I got to get out, but can I do it in an intelligent manner?
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.620]   So Bill, start off, what are the considerations here?
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.740]   What is tax loss harvesting in the first place that people don't know?
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.500]   And then what are some of the things that you can think about when trying to pull this
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   off?
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.060]   So first, honestly, if you're sick of looking at this position, whether it's ARC or whatever
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.660]   else, you're probably better off without it in your portfolio rather than looking at it
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.660]   every day.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:21.100]   The psychological benefit of dumping it is probably going to be greater than any tax
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.100]   benefit you could see.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   Yes.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.140]   The whole, "I'm going to wait until it breaks even," could just have you just pulling your
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.300]   hair out until it happens or maybe never happens.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   Right.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.300]   Exactly.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.580]   So tax loss harvesting, very simply, is selling an asset for less than you paid for it.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.380]   When you capture a gain like that, when you realize, I'm sorry, when you realize a loss
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.380]   like that, they can offset your capital gains.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.220]   Now if you have net losses, up to $3,000 of net losses each year can be used to offset
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.940]   your ordinary income, your wages, your other income on your federal tax filing.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.340]   Excess losses carry forward into future taxes.
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:57.060]   By the way, can the government increase that amount because inflation?
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.060]   Let's put it up to $4,000.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   $4,000.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.320]   I mean, this $3,000 limit has been in place since 1978.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.820]   So we're talking probably close to-
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.820]   Is it really?
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.820]   Holy cow.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.820]   Jeez.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   I don't know.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   I can't do that compounding in my brain.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.700]   It's been 35 years.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.780]   So yeah, it may be time for a change.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.180]   So with tax loss harvesting, let's play with your ARC position.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.020]   Say you have a $10,000 loss on the ARC position.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.020]   You have no other activity for the tax year.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:28.420]   $3,000 of that loss is going to be deductible on your tax filings, and then $7,000 is going
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.780]   to carry forward into the next year.
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.420]   Now let's say you have the $10,000 ARC loss, but you also have an Amazon gain of $15,000
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.660]   that you realize.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.920]   So your net gain is $5,000.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.820]   So the ARC losses are there to offset the gains from the Amazon position.
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.340]   In terms of ordering, now we haven't gone into short-term long-term, so let's do some
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.340]   ordering.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.900]   First, your short-term losses offset your short-term gains.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.820]   Next, your long-term losses offset your long-term gains, and long-term is a holding period of
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.580]   365 days or more.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.840]   If there are excess losses of one type, they can offset the net gains of the other type.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:10.140]   So back to our example, $10,000 ARC loss, $15,000 Amazon gain.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.540]   The ARC loss, let's call it a short-term loss.
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.940]   The Amazon gain is a long-term gain.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.960]   You still have a net $5,000 gain.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.980]   That's going to be a net $5,000 long-term gain because you had $15,000 of long-term
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.900]   gains versus $10,000 of short-term losses.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.780]   Where this is most effective is probably in a portfolio that's mixed between passive and
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.780]   active.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.900]   We do this through direct indexing through our Canvas platform.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.000]   That's our passive investing platform.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.960]   Other robo-advisors like Betterment do a nice job of this.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.720]   But you find losses in your passive portfolio to offset gains in your active portfolio.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.200]   So if you're able to do that, if you're able to have passive losses, you're less likely
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.400]   to worry about the tax on the gains in your active portfolio because you're trading in
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.220]   the active portfolio, but you have losses to soak up any gains.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.220]   So that's where it's most effective is if you have kind of a mix and you're able to
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.600]   realize the losses in the passive side of the portfolio.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.300]   Let's talk about one tax thing I know about.
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   Let's say the wash sale rule.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.980]   Let's say this person was a believer in ARK and they said, "I've got this huge loss, but
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.160]   I want to do something where I can sell these stocks, but I want to stay in the innovation
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160]   game."
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.980]   So there's a bunch of ARK imitators now, right?
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.020]   I found another fund.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.020]   So I sell ARK.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.480]   I lock in this gain.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.220]   I buy another ARK imitator from someone else that's these innovation stocks.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.860]   How long do I have to hold that fund until I can then sell it and buy back into ARK
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.400]   without having some weird taxable thing that messes with my taxes?
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.860]   If you want to buy back ARK, and it sounds like our listener here does not, but if you
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.220]   want to buy back ARK, it's a 30-day waiting period.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.620]   So you can't just sell for a loss and then immediately pick it back up.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.580]   Right now you can do that in crypto, and that's kind of a little bit of a crypto loophole,
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.380]   but for an ARK position on a stock, you can't just sell it for the loss and pick it back
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   up and reset your cost basis.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   There has to be a 30-day waiting period.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:01.260]   And you have to be careful because if you sell ARK and you buy a substantially identical
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.780]   security, that would be a wash sale as well.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:12.060]   Now that substantially identical ruling, that has not been challenged very much in tax breaks,
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.500]   so there's not a long history.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.700]   But the IRS does have language to say you can't buy the substantially identical security.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.480]   Duncan, are you ready to tax loss harvest some of those Robinhood holdings?
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.140]   I think I am.
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.140]   I think I've been doing it.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.140]   All right.
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.140]   Bill, that was great.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.140]   By the way, it's St. Patrick's Day and the first day of March Madness, and my one question
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   is, why is this not a half-day holiday?
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.140]   Everyone's done working at noon.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.140]   We need some time.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.140]   I mean, there's probably 10 basketball games today.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   Duncan said he wanted to drink Guinness for the show.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.140]   It was a little before noon, so we're not quite drinking yet.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.140]   Bill, is that a signed basketball behind you?
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.140]   It's signed by Bill Hertz-Rooney, and so I play basketball with him.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.140]   You know, I don't play with him.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:25:01.380]   It's up for sale, if anyone wants to buy, it's up for sale.
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.260]   On that note, I've actually seen a video of Bill dunking a basketball on a regulation
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   board.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.260]   Oh, that's right.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.260]   Yes.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.260]   Bill, how tall are you?
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.260]   I'm 5'8".
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.300]   A CPA at 5'8" and can dunk.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   Wow.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   Wow.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.300]   That's impressive.
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.300]   Not bad.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   All right.
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.300]   Thanks for all your tax help.
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.740]   We'll have to have Bill back on the show again because, again, we get so many tax questions.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.340]   Keep those questions and comments coming.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.340]   Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:31.540]   If you want to go to idontshop.com, we have a new compound hat in there, I believe.
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.540]   We do.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.660]   It's a flat brim, so Michael can't wear it.
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.580]   Tomorrow, Compound and Friends.
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.580]   Who's on, Duncan?
[00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.580]   Yes.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.620]   So today we have Leanna Hawkins and Dan McMurtry.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.620]   Awesome.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.060]   Animal Spirits will be back on Monday and Wednesday.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.820]   Everyone enjoy all the games, enjoy your weekend, and we'll see you next time.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.460]   See you, everyone.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   Bye.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   Bye.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.460]   Bye.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.460]   Bye.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:55.460]   Bye.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.460]   Bye.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.460]   Bye.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:58.460]   Bye.
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:25:59.460]   Bye.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.460]   Bye.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:01.460]   Bye.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:01.460]   Bye.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.040]   (upbeat music)
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.120]   (upbeat music)
