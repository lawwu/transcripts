[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]   I've seen a lot of entrepreneurs do this
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.800]   where they start off and say,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.240]   okay, I know I've got my day job,
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.000]   but I have X number of hours outside of that work.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   How do I divide it up?
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520]   So one, I don't get burned out
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.600]   and two, I can really check off
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000]   those other really important boxes
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.960]   and have that adequate family time.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.040]   And I think what it is,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.860]   is coming down to a couple of things.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.580]   One is making sure that you always have
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.640]   that work-life balance.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.120]   So there should be a set of non-negotiables
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.320]   that you have in your life on the personal side
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.400]   that are, take care of me first.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   And the second thing is, cut out the frivolous stuff.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.240]   Make time for family first, obviously.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.200]   Set aside that date night once per week
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600]   with your partner to get out there
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.760]   and make sure that you give them
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.160]   your undivided attention.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040]   And then the rest of that free time,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.560]   go and pursue those passion projects
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.080]   with the aim of actually having a measurable,
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.640]   deliverable of launching something
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.000]   so you can see how the market reacts to it.
