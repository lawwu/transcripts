[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   through the ACBC counseling exams.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.120]   I trust that you're all doing well
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.200]   and rejoicing in the goodness of our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.600]   And we just look forward to a wonderful time tonight
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.720]   looking at the study of God's word
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.840]   in relation to a very practical subject,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.520]   which is dealing with sinful anger.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.200]   This is a topic that is related to many counseling issues
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.680]   and you will find this study to be applicable
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.560]   to many counseling sessions that you will be part of
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.360]   if you continue with the ACBC training.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000]   And it is also an issue that is relevant
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.720]   to each of our lives as we are seeking to be more sanctified
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.720]   and become more like Christ.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.440]   We need to learn to put off sinful anger
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   and to put on the fruit of godly character,
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880]   which is always characterized by kindness and patience,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.120]   long-suffering, gentleness, peaceable nature.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.720]   These are the character qualities
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.520]   that we are called to in scripture.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.960]   So just a wonderful topic tonight.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   I'm so glad that you're able to join us.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.560]   And I pray that this will be a blessing to your life
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.840]   and that the Lord will multiply the fruitfulness
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.040]   of our study tonight and that we will be equipped
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.040]   not only to grow ourselves in our own pursuit of Christ,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.960]   but also to be equipped to help others
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000]   in their sanctification.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.100]   So let's pray together.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.480]   Let's devote our time to the Lord
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.420]   and we'll dive right into the notes tonight.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.540]   We're looking at counseling exam number four,
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.560]   dealing with sinful anger.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.800]   So let's pray together.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.080]   Father, we thank you so much for the work of your son,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.760]   Jesus Christ, and for his perfect work
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.360]   that was accomplished on our behalf.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.360]   His life that was lived in full obedience to the law of God,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.720]   for the death that he died on the cross
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.280]   and standing in our place for our sins
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.600]   and his glorious resurrection from the grave.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.680]   We thank you that it is in Christ and through Christ
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.400]   that we come into your presence
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.680]   and that we receive the grace and the mercy
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.200]   that flows into our lives,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   a help in our time of need for we come to you,
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.000]   not on the basis of our own works,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.880]   but on the basis of Christ
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.760]   and his perfect work on our behalf.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.320]   We thank you for the ministry of your spirit
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.680]   who lives in us and who produces
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.320]   the fruit of Christ's likeness in us.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080]   And we thank you for your word,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.880]   the sufficient written word of God,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.700]   the 66 books of the Bible,
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.840]   which is sufficient for life and godliness.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.800]   We pray that as we study your word tonight,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.620]   that you would produce the fruit of godliness
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.360]   in our own lives,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.200]   help us to identify sinful anger and expressions of anger
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.160]   and to repent of our own anger
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.040]   that we may bear the fruit of patience and kindness,
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.520]   gentleness, and that we may be known as peacemakers
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.120]   in our everyday lives.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.600]   So we just devote this time to you.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.720]   Thank you for each student who's joining us on this webinar,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.120]   pray that you would bless each one.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.420]   And we ask this in Jesus name, amen.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.360]   - Amen, well, if you look at your handout for tonight,
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.240]   we are on page one.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   And I just wanted to give you an overview
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.960]   of some of the great resources that are available to you
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.960]   as you study this subject, dealing with sinful anger.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   We just wanna note the practical significance of this topic,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.220]   dealing with sinful anger, as I mentioned,
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.120]   an issue that is relevant
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.720]   to so many different counseling scenarios
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   from marital conflicts to parent-child relationships,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.240]   to dealing with coworkers in the workplace,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.160]   to just dealing with sitting in rush hour traffic.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.640]   Anger is a very prominent issue in counseling ministry.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.440]   And it is an issue that we need to think through
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.960]   with biblical discernment.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.280]   This exam topic is prompting you to articulate
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.920]   in your own words, your view of the issue of sinful anger
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.120]   and how you would go about counseling someone
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.880]   who is dealing with this issue.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.600]   So let me go ahead and read the question tonight.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.200]   Counseling exam number four
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   is provide a biblical definition of anger,
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.660]   describe manifestations of anger
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.980]   in both the inner man and outer man,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.940]   explain the biblical factors that drive anger,
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.940]   detail several biblical strategies to respond to anger.
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.100]   This is a great opportunity to think deeply on this topic.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.660]   I do wanna encourage you as counselors in training
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.860]   to think deeply about the subject of sinful anger
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.200]   as it is addressed in the scriptures.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.080]   I wanna encourage you to take the foundations
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.680]   that were given to you in the year one training
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   of biblical counseling and to apply them
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.280]   to the issue of sinful anger.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.640]   I wanna encourage you that the deeper that you go
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   in your understanding of the subject,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.120]   the more skillful you will be
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.760]   in addressing this issue from scripture.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.560]   And I also wanna make you aware
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.640]   that there is no shortage of people
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.700]   who need help in this area.
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.840]   There seems to be no shortage of people even in the church
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.960]   who are seeking to overcome sinful anger
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.760]   and seeking to put on the sweet characteristics
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   of godliness as described in the fruit of the spirit
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.860]   in Galatians chapter five.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.820]   And so if you become equipped to address
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.560]   the issue of anger in counseling ministry,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.860]   you will have no shortage of opportunities
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.660]   to minister in this area.
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.620]   Now, fortunately, as you look at page one of your handout,
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.000]   there are a number of good resources on the subject
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.580]   that are written from a biblical counseling perspective.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.680]   Now, you don't need to read all of these resources
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.180]   in order to write this essay,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.340]   but I am gonna encourage you to read as much as you can.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.620]   My goal in this session is to stir each of you up
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.620]   in your own heart to have a passion to read more
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.660]   on the subject of dealing with sinful anger
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.700]   and bearing the fruit of the spirit.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.200]   The truth is that you and I need to be better equipped
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.340]   in this area.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.360]   We need counselors in the church who are equipped
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.640]   to minister to those who are seeking
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.860]   to overcome sinful anger.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.720]   Every family in your church is dealing with this issue
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   to some degree in some way.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.840]   And if that family has a two-year-old in their home,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.580]   they are definitely dealing with this issue in some way,
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.900]   not only the anger of the two-year-old,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.280]   but the anger of the parent who is trying to keep
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.080]   the two-year-old under control.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.560]   Every family in the church is dealing with this issue
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.120]   to some degree in some way.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   And so I wanna just encourage you to read as much as you can
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   on this subject, be equipped as much as you can,
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120]   make it a lifelong goal and pursuit to be better equipped
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   to counsel those who are seeking to overcome anger.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.220]   Dr. Robert Jones has a very good work
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.620]   that I would highly recommend.
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.020]   It's entitled "Uprooting Anger,
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.240]   Biblical Help for a Common Problem."
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.740]   That's a very readable book.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.780]   It's a book that you can put in someone else's hands.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.460]   It's very practical, pastoral and biblical.
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.920]   And I just love that title,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.820]   the language of uprooting anger.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.580]   Not just managing behavior,
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.320]   but addressing the root causes of anger,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.080]   which as you know, we have emphasized in this class,
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.920]   the root issues always relate to the issues of the heart.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   And so Dr. Jones models an approach
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.040]   to counseling those who are dealing with anger
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.800]   by using the scriptures to address heart issues.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.920]   And the title "Uprooting Anger" is very helpful
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   to summarize our approach to ministering this area.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.700]   You will find that much of the material
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.040]   coming from secular psychology addresses the issue of anger
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.400]   in seeking to manage outward behavior.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   You'll hear the language of managing anger
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.080]   or managing one's behavior.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.920]   Secular psychology seeks to limit the full expression
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.320]   of a person's anger,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.080]   or at least seeks to give a person healthy avenues
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.920]   to vent their anger.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.360]   But secular psychology does not seek
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.000]   to address the root causes of sinful anger,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.640]   which are always related to a worshiping heart.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.480]   The heart is always relating either rightly or wrongly
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.940]   to the true and the living God.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.520]   And anger is always related
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.480]   to how the heart is relating to God.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   And secular psychology cannot address those issues
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.320]   apart from divine revelation.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.360]   Secular psychology can describe
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.480]   how an angry person behaves.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.280]   And you'll find in secular literature
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.920]   that secular psychology does describe accurately
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.800]   in many cases, how an angry person behaves.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.840]   And secular psychology can give tips and techniques
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.640]   to possibly limit in a temporary manner,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.200]   the full expression of a person's anger,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   but secular psychology cannot address the root issues
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.040]   that give rise to angry expressions.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.120]   And secular psychology cannot help a person
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.360]   become more like Jesus Christ.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.400]   When is an angry person no longer angry?
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.800]   It is when that person loves Jesus Christ,
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.960]   worships Jesus Christ,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.400]   and begins to grow in character qualities
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.240]   that are like Jesus Christ.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.360]   And secular psychology is powerless
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.280]   to affect that type of heart transformation and life change.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.120]   And so while we would concede
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.800]   that secular psychology accurately describes
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.280]   how angry people behave,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   secular psychology cannot make a person more like Christ.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.560]   And that is the goal of biblical counseling.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.200]   So all that to say that Dr. Robert Jones
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.720]   does a wonderful job dealing with the idea
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.840]   of uprooting anger and addressing the root causes
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.180]   of sinful anger.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.040]   Then you have David Powelson's work
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.760]   that is entitled "Good and Angry."
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.920]   The subtitle is "Redeeming Anger, Irritation,
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.880]   Complaining, and Bitterness."
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.520]   Now, dear friends, just think for a moment
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.920]   of how much you and I would be more sanctified
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   and how our relationships would be so much more healthy
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.980]   if we were able to be sanctified from these issues,
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.540]   anger, irritation, complaining, and bitterness.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.400]   And I think that subtitle gives that helpful connection
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.000]   between those issues.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.480]   Maybe there is one person who says,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.680]   "Well, I'm not an angry person,
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   but I'm just complaining all the time."
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.480]   Or, "I'm not an angry person,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.080]   I'm just filled with longstanding bitterness."
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.200]   And they might claim to be able to separate those issues
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.680]   of anger, irritation, complaining, and bitterness.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.640]   But generally those issues go together
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.240]   because they are related to the deeds of the flesh.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.640]   And so anything by David Powelson is worth reading,
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.640]   but that book, "Good and Angry" is a very helpful treatment
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.020]   on the subject of anger.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.640]   Then you have Lou Priolo's "The Heart of Anger,"
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.120]   which is an excellent resource.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.760]   The subtitle is "Practical Help for the Prevention
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.800]   and Cure of Anger in Children."
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.680]   So I remember when my son was two or three years of age,
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.320]   he was playing with his cousin
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.240]   who was also two or three years of age,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.680]   and they were playing with Legos
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.960]   and one boy took a Lego from the other,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.480]   the other boy didn't like it.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.800]   And so one of them hit the other person
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   and they both started crying.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.920]   And so here they are, two toddlers,
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.680]   and they're both crying because they wanted the same Lego
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.800]   and they got angry.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.700]   And I realized that as these children grow to be adults,
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.600]   that the heart issues don't change.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.400]   The only things that change is that the Legos get bigger
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.080]   and maybe more complicated,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.260]   but the same heart dynamics are at work.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.040]   You are in a conflict because you want something
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.440]   that you are not getting.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.280]   You want, maybe not a Lego,
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.560]   but you want respect or you want approval
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.680]   or you want a certain promotion
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.640]   or you wanna be treated in a certain way,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.760]   or you want your life to be a certain way.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.280]   You are not getting what you want.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.280]   And that is why you become angry and enter into a conflict.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.280]   And so anything that is written
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.380]   in order to address the heart issues of children
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.880]   is also applicable to ministering to adults
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.880]   because the heart issues really are no different.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.240]   The issues in life are different,
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.940]   but the heart dynamics are very much the same.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.720]   And Preola does a good job diagnosing
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.080]   the root causes of anger in that book.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.200]   Stuart Scott's "Anger, Anxiety, and Fear"
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.560]   is a booklet that we use often in counseling ministry.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.260]   Anything by Dr. Scott is helpful
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.120]   and written with much wisdom.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   And then a book you might wanna star,
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.560]   it's a book that we use often
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.440]   in the counseling ministry here at Kindred.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.920]   It's Ed Welch's little book that is entitled
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.960]   "A Small Book About a Big Problem,
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.980]   "Meditations on Anger, Patience, and Peace."
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.500]   That has become a go-to book
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.660]   in the Kindred Counseling Ministry.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.800]   We assign it frequently.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.460]   It has 50 short readings on the subject of anger
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.300]   that is designed to be read over the course of 50 days.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.180]   And so that book is meant to be read a little at a time.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.980]   And it is a 50-day assignment for a counselee
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.300]   to read one chapter a day
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.820]   and to interact with the contents of that book.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.860]   Just a very helpful resource.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.580]   We have found that counselees who do read that book
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.820]   make great progress in overcoming sinful anger.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.460]   And so a very good resource that I want to recommend to you.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.500]   I would encourage you to read the three journal articles
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   by David Powelson that I've sent via Dropbox to you.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:56.380]   That's excellent material on the subject of anger.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.380]   And in addition, I've listed two booklets
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.340]   and also three lectures that I would recommend to you
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.580]   for further reflection.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.060]   Just a lot of good material on this subject
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.220]   that I want to put in your hands
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.300]   and hopefully stir up in you a desire
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   to make this a subject or a focus of lifelong study.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:25.380]   Much material there that is very helpful.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.900]   Now let me move to page two of your handout
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.620]   and just talk through the importance of this subject
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.840]   for a moment.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.640]   Dealing with sinful anger.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.340]   Why should you be motivated to write an essay
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.360]   on this subject?
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.180]   And why should you be motivated to study well
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.760]   on this subject?
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.420]   Well, Jim Neuheiser has said this.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.360]   He said, "I believe Jay Adams said that anger is a factor
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.620]   "in 90% of counseling cases."
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.780]   And my only response would be,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.420]   I don't know what the other 10% are
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.500]   in which there is not an issue of anger.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.580]   People in the midst of conflict, people in relationships,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.520]   sometimes even people, they're depressed
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.100]   because they're angry.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.900]   They're anxious because they're fearful.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.740]   Anger is a reaction of judgment
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.900]   when I don't get what I want.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.380]   It's very rare I would have a situation
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.060]   where someone's come for counsel
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.100]   where anger is not involved in some manner.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.460]   So anger is very common in counseling cases,
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.780]   especially relating to marital or family issues.
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.780]   It seems that the closer sinners live in proximity
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.080]   with each other, the more you see anger put on display.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.020]   We note the relation here between anger
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.740]   and other counseling issues, fear, anxiety, and depression.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.380]   Oftentimes those issues tend to go together.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.780]   People who are angry also live with anxiety.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.340]   People who are angry also tend to experience depression.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.540]   We're not surprised by that.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.900]   Anger is ultimately an indicator
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.180]   that a person is not walking in close relationship
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.500]   with Jesus Christ.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.420]   And so when the heart is not submitted to Christ
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.860]   and his word, a person will experience sanctification issues
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.900]   in many areas of life.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.780]   The heart is not submitted to Christ,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.100]   and many deeds of the flesh begin to show themselves.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.220]   And so Galatians 5, verse 19 names the deeds of the flesh,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.260]   which are sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.940]   idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy,
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:51.940]   fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, and divisions,
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.940]   and so forth and so on.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.060]   When a person walks in the flesh
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.820]   and is not filled with the spirit,
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.740]   a number of different expressions of the flesh
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.940]   can be found in that person's life.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:11.900]   And so you'll find that anger is often associated
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.620]   with other sins and other counseling issues.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:22.420]   You'll find that people are often blinded to their own anger.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.940]   Anger always feels completely justified in the moment.
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.940]   Because anger is related to a negative moral judgment
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:40.420]   that is being made upon another person or upon an event.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.220]   So much of counseling ministry
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.940]   is just helping people see what they are doing
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.740]   when they are expressing their anger.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.500]   It's just helping them come to their senses
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.620]   in seeing that they're destroying the relationships
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.780]   that are around them.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.940]   Just getting people to acknowledge the gravity of their sin
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.940]   is really half the battle in dealing with anger issues.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:16.860]   Jesus said that anger is a form of murder in the heart.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.220]   And this anger is expressed in destructive words
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:26.220]   that tear people down and destroy relationships.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.620]   Oftentimes, anger is related
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.780]   to the sin of self-righteousness.
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.660]   I'll just share an example from my own life.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.740]   My wife and kids know that I tend to get
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.740]   quote unquote irritated or quote unquote frustrated.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.140]   You'll remember from our year one training,
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.180]   those are just words that we use to describe sinful anger.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.340]   We use other words
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.420]   because we don't wanna say I'm sinfully angry.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.300]   So we say I'm irritated or I'm frustrated
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.940]   or I'm miffed or whatever the language is,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.060]   we just substitute because we don't like to say
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.500]   I'm sinfully angry.
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.260]   Well, I tend to get quote unquote irritated or frustrated
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.140]   when I come home from work at the end of the day
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.580]   and find that the house is in a bit of a mess.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.820]   And by the way, my wife and I have four children.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.580]   So you might be saying,
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.980]   Dan, what are your expectations
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.020]   with four children living in the house?
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.860]   How can you expect the house to be completely clean
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:29.820]   when you come home?
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.540]   And that is a fair response to my illustration.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.060]   But the point is I would tend to get upset when I come home
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.300]   and I see that the kitchen is a mess
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.340]   or the living room is not tidy.
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:47.820]   And it is interesting what would come out of my mouth
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.060]   in those occasions.
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.060]   It wasn't just, well, children,
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.580]   could you please clean up the kitchen
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.100]   or children, could you please clean up the living room?
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.060]   Oftentimes it is something along the lines of
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   I've worked hard all day and this is what I come home to.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.340]   Now, what is that?
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.700]   That is the language of self-righteousness.
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.180]   It is the language that says,
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.740]   I deserve to come home to a cleaner house
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.780]   because of what I have done all day.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:33.820]   And you'll find that type of language when people get angry.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.340]   It is not just that they want the situation to be different
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.180]   or they want to be treated in a different way,
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.100]   but you will find that the issue of self-righteousness
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.100]   arises in their hearts.
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.700]   Self-justification, because I have done this or that,
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.460]   or because I have behaved in a righteous way,
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.860]   I deserve to be treated in a different way.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.700]   And so anger is oftentimes related to
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.740]   this type of self-righteousness,
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.740]   which is a form of pride instead of simply acknowledging
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   our need for grace in every area of life.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.420]   And so that's something that can be explored
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.580]   in greater detail, but just note that,
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.420]   that anger can be related to self-righteousness
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.980]   as well as to other sins and other deeds of the flesh.
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.500]   Also note that the quietest personalities
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.260]   can also have the angriest hearts.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.940]   Anger is not a personality issue.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.340]   It's not a cultural issue.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.460]   It really is a spiritual issue.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.820]   It is a heart issue.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:51.060]   And so anger cannot be defined by mere personality type.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:56.540]   No one can say, well, I just have an angry personality
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.940]   and that excuses me because it can be found
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.220]   on a personality chart somewhere.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.780]   The bottom line is that if you're angry,
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:11.020]   you are not being like Christ.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.820]   And the issue is that we need to repent of our anger
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.100]   and submit our hearts to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.580]   The sin of anger is often related to critical
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.420]   and abusive words.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.980]   James says in James 3, verse six,
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.140]   that the tongue is set among our members,
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.620]   staining the whole body, setting on fire
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.620]   the entire course of life and set on fire by hell.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.340]   The point is that we speak out of the overflow
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.660]   of what fills our hearts.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.740]   And so if our hearts are filled with anger,
[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.740]   then our words will be critical and destructive.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.740]   Angry words tear down and cause great harm.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.740]   Note here that a subcategory of this topic
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.020]   is dealing with a person's anger at God.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.980]   I'm not gonna have time to get into that subtopic,
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.100]   but Robert Jones and David Powelson
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.300]   have done some good work in this area,
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.540]   just working through how to help a person
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   who says that he or she is angry at God.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:32.420]   And so the Bible speaks much about the sin of anger.
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.940]   David Powelson does a good job surveying this issue
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.740]   as it is found in Scripture,
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:42.580]   from the blame shifting of Adam and Eve
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.060]   in the Garden of Eden,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.300]   to the murder of Abel by his brother Cain,
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.300]   to the anger of Moses displayed in the wilderness
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.100]   when he struck the rock instead of speaking to it,
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.740]   to the brooding temper of Saul, the self-willed king.
[00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.740]   Powelson says both by precept and example,
[00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.580]   the Bible continually enlightens us about anger
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.980]   intending to change us.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.020]   The motivations for sinful anger
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.260]   are exposed within Scripture.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.180]   Why do the Israelites grumble repeatedly in the wilderness?
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.260]   The Bible doesn't leave us in doubt.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.420]   They didn't get what they wanted,
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.220]   and they didn't believe that God was good,
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.180]   powerful, and wise.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.540]   In all cases, the cause of sinful anger
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.260]   boils down to specific lies and lusts
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.220]   that rule the human heart.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.100]   You and those you counsel are no different.
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:55.020]   Why is this essay topic so important?
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.900]   Dear friends, it is important
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.900]   because the sin of anger is an issue of the heart
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.340]   that reveals what we truly love and what we truly worship.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:14.820]   If I worship my job, I will be angry at my competitor.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.100]   If I worship my own comfort,
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.180]   I'll be angry when I'm stuck in rush hour traffic.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.060]   If I worship my bank account,
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.340]   I will be angry when the economy goes south
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.300]   or when a business fails.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.860]   If I worship my own reputation,
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.260]   I will be angry when others do not treat me
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.220]   with the respect that I think I deserve.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:42.260]   Show me what makes you sinfully angry,
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.740]   and I will show you what you truly love,
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.940]   what you truly trust, what you truly treasure,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.420]   and ultimately what you truly worship.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.620]   And so when we're dealing with our own sinful anger,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   we are not dealing with an issue
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.460]   that can be viewed in isolation.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:08.460]   Dealing with this issue in our own sanctification
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:13.220]   is really a way of drawing us to worship
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   the true and the living God.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.620]   It is an issue of submitting our hearts
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.660]   to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:28.540]   It is an issue of asking God to purify our hearts,
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.980]   to cleanse our hearts,
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.820]   so that he will rule over our hearts
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:39.820]   and over every desire and treasure of our hearts.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:44.700]   And when our hearts are purified and transformed in this way,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.100]   we become more like Christ.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:53.020]   And we begin to demonstrate the character qualities
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.900]   that are beautiful in his sight,
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.180]   patience and kindness, gentleness,
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:06.740]   and those issues that, those characteristics
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.220]   that reflect the loveliness of our savior.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.940]   Secular psychology can't do that.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.060]   Can never deal with the root issue.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:21.060]   Secular psychology cannot deal with the worship issues
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.540]   in a person's life.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.340]   If you read the DSM-4 or the DSM-5,
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:30.060]   you will find accurate descriptions of how people behave.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:35.340]   You will find accurate descriptions of how people behave
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.700]   when they are angry.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.700]   In the DSM-5, there are more than 32 disorders
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:46.820]   that list anger, aggression, or irritability as a symptom.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.740]   What you will not find in the secular literature
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.740]   is a description of the root issues
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.780]   that cause people to become angry
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   or the solutions to those root issues that give hope
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.660]   and the help for change.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.460]   One of the things that I like to say to people in counseling
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.660]   when they're dealing with the issue of anger,
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.620]   especially if I'm assured that this person is a believer,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.140]   is just to say, "Brother, you don't need to be a slave
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.620]   "to anger.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.940]   "You don't need to destroy the relationships
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.780]   "that are around you.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.340]   "You don't need to hurt your wife in this way.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.740]   "The Bible says you are not a slave to sin,
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.980]   "and you can repent.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.020]   "You can grow.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.740]   "You can bear the fruit of patience and kindness
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.260]   "and faithfulness and self-control.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.300]   "You can love Christ more than you love
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.220]   "whatever you are worshiping in your life right now.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.180]   "By God's grace and through the work of Jesus on the cross,
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.420]   "you have been freed from the power of sin,
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.220]   "and you can grow.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.300]   "You don't need to be a slave to anger."
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.380]   And I say this as one who was enslaved to anger
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.220]   in my unbelieving life.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.060]   Before I came to Christ, I was a slave to the sin of anger.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:18.860]   And by God's grace, through the work of Jesus on the cross,
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.260]   I've been freed from that sin.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.140]   And although I still am tempted to anger
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.660]   and struggle with anger, I am not a slave to this sin.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.340]   I have been, by God's grace, able to grow in this area
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.340]   and overcome anger in my life.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.380]   Secular psychology can't do that
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.740]   for any of our counselees.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.860]   And so we have noted that one example
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.700]   of how the secular world describes anger
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.660]   is using the diagnosis of IED,
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.860]   or Intermittent Explosive Disorder.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   We've covered that in year one.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.420]   What I find interesting about the DSM's description
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.580]   of Intermittent Explosive Disorder
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.260]   is that there really is no hope for life change.
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   This disorder can be managed,
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.340]   and hopefully over time it will go away.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.340]   But the secular world can't give solutions to this issue.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.660]   At the bottom of your handout,
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.420]   you have the Mayo Clinic's 10 tips to tame your temper.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.900]   Number one, think before you speak.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.140]   Once you're calm, express your anger, get some exercise,
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.660]   take a timeout, identify possible solutions,
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.540]   stick with I statements, don't hold a grudge,
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.620]   use humor to release tension, practice relaxation skills,
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.220]   and know when to seek help.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.780]   Now, I am not doubting that some of those help,
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.220]   some of those tips may be helpful.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.220]   In temporarily restraining the full expression
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:00.020]   of a person's anger,
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:05.300]   you might find that some of these things may help you
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   not explode when you're in traffic on a certain freeway.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.460]   They may be helpful in a very limited temporary way,
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.940]   but none of those tips will help a person
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.580]   become more like Jesus Christ.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:25.540]   And so the secular world can only manage behavior.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.780]   I've noticed on, I've noted on page two,
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:36.780]   the three approaches that the secular world seeks to use
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.900]   in addressing the issue of anger.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.900]   And I'll just note this just briefly for your reference,
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.220]   'cause I do think it's helpful
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.540]   in contrasting what the Bible says
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.380]   versus what the secular world says about anger.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.060]   The psychodynamic approach is basically the idea
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:58.660]   that anger is sort of this neutral energy fluid
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.700]   that builds up inside of you.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.700]   And the way you deal with it is you let it out.
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.340]   It's sort of this idea is that there is this pressure
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.740]   that is building up inside of you.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:13.620]   So you have to vent all that pressure out.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.260]   And if you release it, then the issue will be solved.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.780]   Well, the problem with that is that the Bible says
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.540]   that anger is not neutral.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.940]   Anger is a form of murder in the heart.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.940]   And so you don't wanna be releasing murder in the heart
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.940]   out into the world.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.100]   You wanna be dealing with that heart issue before the Lord.
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.340]   But that is the psychodynamic approach.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.420]   There is the behaviorist approach,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.060]   which says that anger is learned from people in society.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.100]   And so your father was angry,
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.340]   therefore you learned your anger from him.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.780]   And there is some truth to that.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.860]   I mean, there is some truth that if you go
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.980]   with an angry person and you spend time
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.260]   with an angry person, that you will learn
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:07.260]   that person's ways, Proverbs 23 warns against that.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.140]   And yet this approach does not account for the fact
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.540]   that a two-year-old who has wonderfully sweet parents
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.220]   will still throw a temper tantrum.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.780]   Even though that two-year-old has not observed
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.060]   his father or mother throw temper tantrums,
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.420]   he has somehow learned to do a temper tantrum
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.580]   all by himself.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.260]   I never had to teach my children lessons
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.700]   on how to become angry.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.940]   I did have to teach them lessons on how to be selfless
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.260]   and how to serve others.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.140]   But the behaviorist approach can't account
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.820]   for the fact that anger is not only learned.
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.460]   Anger is an issue of the heart and sinners are born
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:54.620]   into this world knowing how to be angry.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.460]   And then there is the cognitive approach.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.420]   This again is the secular world seeking to deal
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.020]   with this issue, which says that anger is based
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.580]   on beliefs and expectations.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.700]   Again, there's some truth to that.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.820]   Anger is related to what we believe.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.340]   And yet the cognitive approach does not account
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.420]   for the fact that we live in relationship with God.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.820]   A secular approach to dealing with anger can't account
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.580]   for the heart's relationship with the true
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.020]   and the living God and how we either relate
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.620]   to God rightly or wrongly.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:38.620]   And so the secular world cannot transform a person
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.900]   and make that person more like Christ.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.900]   So just simply stated, the goal in biblical counseling
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.300]   is not to manage behavior.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.380]   We learned that in year one.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:58.300]   The goal in biblical counseling is to help an angry person
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.860]   become a worshiper of Jesus Christ so that the fruits
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.860]   of the spirit begin to grow in that person's life.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.260]   With that said, let me move to page three of your handout
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.260]   and give you a biblical definition for anger.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.020]   Robert Jones has written this,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.980]   "Our anger is our whole person's active response
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.980]   of negative moral judgment against perceived evil."
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.740]   That's a good definition you'll find
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.060]   in his book, "Uprooting Anger."
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.620]   It's also a very quotable definition
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.620]   that really encompasses a lot of things
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.060]   that the Bible says about the sin of anger.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.620]   Our anger is our whole person that is both heart
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.340]   and body, both immaterial and material,
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:53.820]   both soul and body are involved in anger.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.460]   It is a heart issue, a form of murder in the heart,
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.220]   but you will find that it affects what we say,
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.460]   how we behave, it affects our emotions.
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.460]   And so our anger is our whole person active response.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:12.820]   That is to say that we're not just passively letting out
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.460]   neutral pressure that is built up inside of us
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.380]   when we are angry, we are actively sinning
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.460]   when we are angry.
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.740]   And so he says, "It is our whole person active response
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:34.260]   of negative moral judgment against perceived evil."
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.660]   Now that last part of the definition is very helpful
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:42.180]   and I just wanna camp on that for a moment.
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.500]   When you and I are angry, we are making a moral judgment.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:55.700]   Our hearts are declaring that a certain person
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.140]   or certain event is morally wrong.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:06.420]   So it's wrong that that person took my parking spot
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.940]   on a Sunday morning.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.220]   Or it's wrong that this person sat in the seat
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.860]   that I saved on a Sunday morning.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.740]   Or it's wrong that that person took the donut
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.140]   that I wanted to eat on a Sunday morning.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.300]   So there's lots of temptations to become angry
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.580]   just on a Sunday morning.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.340]   We haven't even gotten to Monday yet.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.900]   The point is that the heart is always making
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.540]   these moral judgments.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:42.980]   I am angry because my heart has declared a certain situation
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.500]   or a certain person to be wrong.
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   It is wrong that the dishes are not cleaned by my children
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.460]   when I come home.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.060]   Or it is wrong that this person does not treat me
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.700]   with the respect that I think I deserve.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   It is wrong that my parents won't give me what I want.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.300]   That is the dynamic, the heart dynamic at work in anger.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.220]   It's just helpful to recognize that,
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   that your heart is making a negative moral judgment
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.340]   against perceived evil.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.500]   And let me apply that for just a moment.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.660]   Let's take the example of when a married couple fights
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.620]   or has a conflict.
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.180]   My wife, Mina, and I have been married for 24 years.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:35.180]   And I like to tell people we have no practical experience
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.540]   at this at all.
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.780]   And I'm being totally humorous.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:44.140]   Of course, we have experience at being in conflict
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.980]   and having to resolve conflict.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.620]   I hope you know me well enough to know
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:54.020]   that my wife and I experience conflict.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.580]   We are two sinners who have our share
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.620]   of differing viewpoints in life.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.700]   But we have learned to recognize that when we are
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.660]   in a conflict and when anger is involved,
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.540]   that generally what is happening is that the two of us
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:15.100]   are making a moral judgment of the other person.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.660]   What is happening in the conflict is that we are trying
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:23.660]   to justify ourselves and blame the other person
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.140]   for what is wrong.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.740]   Conflict Resolution 101 says this,
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.900]   "Stop trying to justify yourself.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.500]   Stop trying to show the other person
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.820]   where the other person is wrong.
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:47.140]   Instead, confess your sins to the other person
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   and show the other person where you are wrong.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:58.140]   Turn your moral judgment upon yourself
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.260]   and allow that moral judgment to lead you to repentance.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.340]   Before the Lord."
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:12.580]   The point is that whenever anger is involved in a conflict,
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.460]   a certain moral judgment is taking place.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:23.220]   You are standing as the judge upon a person
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.820]   or a certain situation.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.780]   And in that sense, you are taking the place of God
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.660]   because there is only one true judge
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.700]   who makes a righteous judgment all the time.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.900]   And so I think that last part of the definition
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.140]   is very helpful.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:47.020]   Our anger is our whole person's active response
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.620]   of negative moral judgment against perceived evil.
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.420]   Now, if you look at page three of your handout,
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.340]   you have the forms of anger listed.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.860]   This is based off of Ephesians chapter four, verse 31.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.220]   Paul says, "Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.620]   and clamor and slander be put away from you
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.940]   along with all malice."
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.940]   He uses a number of different words for anger.
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:19.660]   It's the put off.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.900]   "Let all bitterness, wrath and anger be put away from you."
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.260]   And then verse 32, he talks about the put on.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.740]   "Be kind to one another, tender-hearted,
[00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you."
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.940]   When is an angry person no longer angry?
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.940]   Not only when that person puts off sinful anger,
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.580]   but an angry person is no longer angry
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:54.420]   when he or she is kind, tender-hearted
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:59.420]   and fulfilled with forgiveness for other people.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:05.500]   And so you have the forms of anger listed there.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.940]   I won't take the time to walk through all of that,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:12.940]   but just note that Paul says that all bitterness
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.140]   and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.660]   is to be put away from us.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:24.220]   This is a call to deal with the sin of anger,
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.900]   decisively and radically.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:33.900]   Let me move to towards the bottom of page three
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   on your handout
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.740]   and just walk through some elements of this definition.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.840]   We noted that anger is an active response.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:49.220]   You and I are actively sinning when we are angry.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.100]   If we can actively sin,
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.460]   we can actively repent of that sin.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.360]   Colossians 3, verse eight,
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.660]   "But now you must put them all away."
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.660]   The word put away refers to a decisive, definitive action
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:17.200]   that needs to be carried out with a sense of urgency.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:23.040]   You don't need a blow off steam.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.140]   You don't need to cool off.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:30.100]   What you need to do is put your anger away.
[00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   Repent of that sin and do it immediately.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.500]   Ephesians four talks about,
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.020]   "Do not let the sun go down on your anger."
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.200]   This is not a call to vent your anger.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.140]   It is not a call to release your anger.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.020]   It is a call to repent from your anger.
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.380]   Don't vent what's in your heart.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.020]   Submit your heart to the Lordship of Christ.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.020]   Just say to the Lord,
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.300]   "Lord, my anger is revealing a heart
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.700]   "that is in rebellion against you.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.920]   "And I don't wanna live in rebellion against you,
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.580]   "unsubmissive to your word.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.180]   "Soften my heart, Lord.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:21.180]   "Bring my heart in submission to you."
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.060]   James one verse 19, "Know this my beloved brothers,
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.020]   "let every person be quick to hear,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.020]   "slow to speak, slow to anger."
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:39.660]   Did Jesus become righteously angry in his earthly ministry?
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.760]   He did.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.160]   There is a place for righteous anger in the Christian's life.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.880]   But even when Jesus became righteously angry,
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.880]   he demonstrated in his earthly ministry a slowness to anger.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:02.560]   How many times did he put up with the disciples questioning
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.960]   and their failures and their weaknesses
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.860]   without becoming angry with those men?
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.500]   And James calls us to be slow to anger.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.340]   Why?
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.480]   Anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   You accomplish nothing good when you become sinfully angry.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.700]   Therefore, James says, here's the word again, put away.
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.000]   Now that is a call to action.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.880]   Put away, again, the comprehensive term,
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:40.280]   all filthiness and rampant wickedness.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.000]   And receive with meekness the implanted word
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.700]   which is able to save your souls.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:54.060]   The connection between dealing with anger
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:59.060]   and hearing God's word, dealing with sin
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:03.300]   and receiving the word of God into our hearts
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.260]   is noteworthy in this text.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:10.860]   You and I don't hear the word of God well when we are angry.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:15.040]   If our hearts are filled with pride
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.280]   and arguments against other people
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.220]   and self-righteousness and self-justification,
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:26.440]   then we are not able to hear the word of God taught
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.080]   and preached, at least not with great profit.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:36.000]   And James says that we are to put away our anger
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.960]   as well as filthiness and wickedness
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.040]   so that we may receive the word of God.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:49.800]   The word of God would bear fruit in our lives.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.560]   So anger is an active response,
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.240]   which in some ways is a hopeful truth
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.520]   because it means that we can actively repent from anger.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.840]   Let me move to page four of your handout
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.020]   and just note here that anger is a hard issue.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.480]   We have used these verses often in our year one training.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:13.900]   I'm just applying it here to the issue of anger.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.000]   Anger is a hard issue.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.280]   Matthew 15, verse 19,
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.320]   "For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.200]   "murder, adultery, sexual immorality,
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.820]   "theft, false witness, slanders.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.940]   "These are what defile a person,
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.680]   "but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person."
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.900]   Proverbs 4, verse 23,
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.440]   "Keep your heart with all vigilance
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.400]   "for from it flow the springs of life."
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.680]   Matthew 5, verse 21,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.380]   "You have heard that it was said to those of old,
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.240]   "you shall not murder
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.720]   "and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.860]   "But I say to you that everyone who is angry
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.180]   "with his brother will be liable to judgment.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.840]   "Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   "Whoever says you fool will be liable to the hell of fire."
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.960]   Anger is a hard issue.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.940]   Remember from year one, the dynamics of the heart.
[00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.460]   I'll just place this on the slide here.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.300]   We looked at the fact that the heart has thoughts.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.020]   Scripture talks about the thoughts
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.700]   and the intentions of the heart.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.780]   The heart has desires.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.020]   Scripture talks about the desires of the heart.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.100]   And the heart also has treasures or values.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:33.420]   Jesus said where your treasure is, your heart will be also.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.460]   So we have these dynamics that relate to the heart.
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:40.000]   The heart is always thinking, desiring, treasuring,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.280]   valuing, declaring something or someone
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.300]   to be worthy of its affections.
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:52.260]   And so out of the heart flow the issues of life.
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.840]   Anger reveals what is in your heart.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   And so out of the heart's thinking and desiring
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.200]   and treasuring and worshiping come external actions,
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.920]   emotions, and words.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.320]   And so what we find is that secular psychology
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   is seeking to manage behavior from an external perspective.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.080]   Secular psychology is seeking to address actions,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.400]   emotions, and words without dealing with the dynamics
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.040]   of the heart, the thoughts, and the desires,
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   and the values which are characteristic of the heart.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:38.020]   And so we don't wanna be merely managing behavior.
[00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.620]   We want to be instruments that are used by God
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.120]   to affect spirit-led transformation of the heart.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   That brings us to the key text that is on page three,
[00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.440]   James 4, verses one to two.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.040]   James says, "What causes quarrels
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.680]   "and what causes fights among you?
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.620]   "Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:08.720]   "You desire and do not have, so you murder,
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.120]   "you covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.640]   "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.480]   That's the heart issue that is related to the sin of anger.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.000]   It goes back to the two toddlers
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.260]   who were fighting over the Legos.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.860]   You want something that you do not have.
[00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.820]   You want something that you are not getting.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:34.620]   You want something and someone is in the way.
[00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:38.500]   And so you're angry at that person
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.800]   for standing in the way of your heart's desire.
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.540]   You are angry because you are wanting something
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.800]   more than you want the glory of God.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.740]   Some potential things that you may want
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.580]   are listed by Jim Uheiser in the homework sheet
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.420]   that I sent to you.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.220]   That's a good sheet to just give to a counselee.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.280]   Potential things that people want,
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.760]   that they become angry when they don't get it.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.660]   I wanna be respected, appreciated.
[00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:11.540]   I want to be comfortable.
[00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:13.860]   I want to be successful.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.380]   I want to be treated fairly.
[00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:19.020]   I want to be free from problems and pressures.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.520]   I mean, that's something that you will notice
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:27.520]   that in my case study, when I come home from a day's work,
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.140]   and I believe that because of my day's work
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.720]   that I should enter into a hassle-free zone.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:40.460]   My house should be a place with no problems and no issues.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.880]   And when I don't get what I want,
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.540]   I'm willing to become angry over it.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:48.060]   That's just helpful to see how the heart dynamics
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.720]   are interacting with the issues of life.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:56.420]   I want to have a life which is free from difficulty.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.220]   I want to have a spouse who is affectionate.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.220]   I want to have a spouse who is not late.
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:06.540]   That's a issue that may apply to many families
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.100]   on a Sunday morning or even a weekday morning.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.420]   I wanna have children who make me look good.
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.180]   I want to get my own way.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.100]   I wanna be happy, be safe, be pain-free.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.500]   I want to be thought of as intelligent and witty.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.240]   Just, Neuhauser is doing a number on us.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.860]   He's just listing a number of things
[00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:32.860]   that the heart can desire in an idolatrous way.
[00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:37.380]   How do you know that those desires have become idolatrous?
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.560]   You become angry when you don't get them.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   And so, as I said, this issue is a way
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:52.920]   of seeing how our hearts are truly worshiping.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:59.880]   We note here that it's possible to want a good thing
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.040]   in a wrong way.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.600]   Is it wrong to want my wife to respect me?
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.040]   No, not necessarily.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.440]   But if I want that respect so much that I'm willing to sin,
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.080]   if I don't get it, then that desire
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.840]   has become an idolatrous lust.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.760]   So on the screen here, I put the throne staircase diagram,
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.440]   which you'll find in Robert Jones's materials.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.840]   We use this in counseling ministry.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.580]   Sometimes it's helpful with a counselee
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.440]   to just write out or draw out some diagrams
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:34.240]   that help them to understand basic biblical concepts.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.040]   And basically, here you have on the throne
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.520]   what should be happening, which is Christ
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.240]   should be on the throne of your heart,
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.920]   ruling over every desire.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.120]   And yet there are some desires that begin
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.940]   at the bottom of the staircase that ascend the staircase
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:56.120]   and then occupy the throne
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.040]   and they begin to rule over the heart.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.720]   And that's what James is talking about,
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.320]   that the source of your conflict is a desire
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.360]   that is in your heart.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:11.520]   And so we use this diagram just to illustrate for counselees
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.280]   there are desires that really should be at the bottom
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.480]   of the staircase that may have ascended
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.040]   to the throne of your heart.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.720]   And now they are seeking to take the place of Christ
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.120]   on the throne of your heart.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.480]   We want Christ to rule over every desire.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:35.540]   The cure for an idolatrous heart is repentance and submission
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.760]   before the Lord, James 4, verse 8.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.560]   Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.980]   Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts,
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.400]   you double-minded.
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.800]   Be wretched and mourn and weep.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.880]   Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:55.160]   Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:58.440]   So we cover that anger is an active response.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.840]   Anger is a heart issue.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.480]   And thirdly, anger involves a moral judgment,
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.640]   James 4, verse 12.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:11.360]   Who are you to judge your neighbor?
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.080]   Jones says our anger, in essence,
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.320]   involves a negative moral judgment that we make.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.480]   It arises from our judicial sense
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:23.400]   and functions under the larger dynamic of judgmentalism.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.560]   In the sense, we may call anger a moral emotion.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:31.920]   Anger protests what you did was wrong.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.880]   It pronounces that action is unjust.
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.520]   It pleads this must stop.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.880]   Anger objects to wrongs committed.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.360]   So what we do in biblical counseling
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:51.920]   is we help people reflect on what they are
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.000]   doing when they become angry.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   We give assignments.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.840]   We dialogue.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.660]   We ask questions.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:02.880]   And what we are trying to do is help
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.300]   people reflect on their own conduct
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:10.360]   and reflect on what it is that their hearts are
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.160]   doing when they become angry over a certain situation.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.040]   I sent you a homework assignment that was written out
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:18.200]   by Lou Priolo.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.680]   It's very helpful.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   It asks the questions, what circumstances
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.520]   led to my becoming angry?
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:29.000]   What did I do when I became angry?
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.760]   What is the biblical evaluation of what
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.380]   I did when I became angry?
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.760]   And what should I have done when I became angry?
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.400]   And that's just a homework assignment
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.680]   that is designed to help a counselee reflect
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.120]   on their own behavior and what are the heart issues that
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:50.400]   are leading to this expression of anger.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.880]   And we're seeking to help the counselee bring their heart
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   to submission before the Lord.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.520]   Very quickly on page 5 of your handout, just a brief note.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.720]   I'm not going to go over this in great detail.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:09.880]   But just the question asks about the whole person.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.680]   So just note that, as we've talked about,
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.120]   the heart issues that give rise to anger,
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.560]   that anger also affects the outer man, the body.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.200]   You see this in the example of Cain and Abel,
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.960]   that Cain became angry and his face fell.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.080]   And so anger shows itself in what a person
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.360]   does with his or her body.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.140]   It affects the outer man.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.640]   And then we see that anger expresses itself
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.200]   in destructive words and actions.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.920]   As I mentioned, I think I mentioned Keith Palmer, who's
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.800]   my friend and who oversees the counseling ministry here
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.920]   from a distance.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.120]   He's an ACBC fellow and board member.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.000]   He did an excellent seminar on sword words or verbal abuse
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.920]   that is found at the ACBC website
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.080]   and relating that to the heart issue of anger.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.120]   Just a very helpful seminar that you
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.520]   might want to listen to in preparation
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.200]   to writing this essay.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   Strategies to deal with sinful anger.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.800]   There are many that we could name here,
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.920]   but the three main ones that I would highlight
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.720]   is, just very practically, so much
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.520]   of working with a counselee is helping
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.140]   them not to be self-deceived.
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.040]   A person who is angry feels justified in his anger.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.880]   As it's been said by others, I've
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.200]   never lost an argument in my own mind.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:51.240]   When you are angry, you will feel also
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.600]   righteous in that anger.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:58.640]   And you may even feel that you are righteously expressing
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.800]   that anger in a way that is making a situation move
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.960]   from wrong to right.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.800]   And James says that your anger is not
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.540]   accomplishing anything helpful.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.440]   The anger of man does not accomplish
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.240]   the righteousness of God.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.520]   So just helping people not to be self-deceived
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:18.620]   about what they're doing.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.800]   And it requires a lot of patience
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:26.240]   in asking good questions, good homework assignments.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.000]   But helping people just recognize their anger,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.280]   and then also seeing the seriousness,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.160]   the gravity of their anger, is one of the first ways
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.440]   to deal with the issue.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.320]   Identifying ungodly desires.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:45.520]   What do you want right now that more than you
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.240]   want the glory of God?
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.880]   If you do counseling long enough,
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.280]   you find that people will tell you exactly what they want.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.720]   They will say exactly what they want.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.320]   I just want my wife to treat me in a certain way.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.400]   The key is to bring those desires in submission
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.040]   to the Lord.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.400]   And then actively pursuing Christ-like character
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.700]   is helpful.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.880]   I want to leave you with an illustration
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.760]   that I found very helpful from the writings of Paul Tripp.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.940]   And I hope that this will give you some hope in counseling
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.440]   ministry.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.240]   And it's also a great example of how powerful counseling can be.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.080]   And he has this--
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.880]   I think it's on his blog, so it's very public.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.160]   He writes, "I was a very angry man.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.800]   The problem is that I didn't know I was an angry man.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.440]   My wife, Luella, knew I was angry.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:46.120]   My kids knew I was angry, but I didn't know.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.040]   Luella was very faithful in bringing that anger before me
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.280]   with this result in failures to love my family.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.680]   She did it often and with much grace, but I wouldn't listen.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.920]   Again and again, I would wrap myself in robes of righteousness
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   and tell her what a great husband I was.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:08.240]   I said I would pray for her problem with discontentment.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.720]   I was a man in the midst of destroying my marriage, family,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:14.200]   and ministry, and I didn't know it.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.600]   This is embarrassing to admit, but there was an occasion
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.800]   when Luella was confronting me, and I
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.320]   said these deeply humble words.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.440]   95% of the women in our church would
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.200]   love to be married to a man like me.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.200]   I bet that helped the problem.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.160]   Luella very quickly informed me that she was part of the 5%.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.760]   I was convinced that no one had a more accurate picture of me
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.520]   than I did.
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:38.600]   In my blindness, I also failed to see and fear the disaster
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.640]   that I was heading toward.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.360]   Now, here's where the counseling comes into play.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.440]   On the way home from a ministry training weekend,
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.360]   my brother Ted suggested that we should
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.160]   make the things we learned practical to our personal lives.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.800]   He then began to ask questions about my marriage.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.080]   As he asked, it was as if God was ripping down curtains,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.160]   and I saw and heard myself with accuracy
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.280]   for the first time in years.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.480]   Praise God for the specificity of the convicting ministry
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.920]   of the Holy Spirit.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.760]   As my eyes were open, I couldn't believe what I had said and
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.260]   done.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.960]   I was broken and grieved.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.880]   It was hard for me to believe that the man who I was seeing
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.920]   was me.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.240]   I couldn't wait to get home.
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.660]   When I entered my house that night,
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:25.560]   Luella could tell that something was up on my seriousness.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.760]   I asked her if we could talk.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.800]   After we sat down, I said, I know for years
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.760]   that you've been trying to talk to me about my anger
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.960]   and my failure to love you and the kids as I should,
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.120]   and I've been unwilling to listen.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.320]   I can honestly say tonight that I'm ready to listen.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.720]   I want to hear.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.280]   He writes that the next several weeks were extremely painful,
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.120]   as I saw that anger everywhere.
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:50.840]   But I experienced the transformative pain of grace.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.520]   God was causing that anger to become so repulsive to me
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.360]   that I would never want to be there again.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.000]   By God's grace, that life-dominating anger is gone.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.880]   Grace has removed the power of that old anger from my heart.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.720]   He's not talking about perfectionism there.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:11.880]   He's just saying that his eyes were opened and convicted
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.400]   to repent of that sin, and now he can make progress
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.200]   in his sanctification.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.960]   I share that story for a couple of reasons.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:25.600]   One, Paul Tripp is a very recognized biblical counselor.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.440]   And so if he struggled with anger,
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.360]   then all of us need to do the work of looking at ourselves
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.440]   first before we would try to counsel others in this area.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.600]   Number two, you see how blinding anger can be,
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.840]   that you can feel completely justified
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:53.480]   and be completely blinded to the issue of anger in your life.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.760]   And so much of the work is praying for the Holy Spirit
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.360]   to help people see the issue in their lives.
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.080]   And then I share that story, number three,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:08.160]   because Paul Tripp had a good brother named Ted
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.400]   who knew how to counsel and knew how to ask the right questions,
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.480]   who knew how to draw out the purposes of the heart
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.440]   and then to address biblically the sin of anger.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.000]   And I share that story because God used Ted
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.760]   as an instrument in the Redeemer's hands
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.600]   to help his brother grow in sanctification
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.360]   and possibly saved a marriage, a family, a ministry,
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:39.160]   and brought many blessings to bear in a person's life
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.000]   and possibly in the church's life.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.920]   And I just want to commend that example to you
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:50.600]   and pray that you and I may be one day
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:53.400]   that counselor in someone else's life,
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.440]   to be used in a person's life
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.640]   to bring about that sanctification,
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.520]   that a marriage may be healed, a family may be healed,
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.880]   that blessings may be brought to the church,
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.640]   that you and I would become skilled in counseling
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.240]   in the area of dealing with sinful anger.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.000]   I want to trust that to you and trust that to the Lord
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.400]   and pray that this was a helpful study
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.760]   as we prepare for counseling exam number four.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.720]   Thank you all so much for being here tonight
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.520]   and for joining us for this study.
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.960]   We look forward to seeing the fruits of this study
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:36.280]   in your counseling exams and in your further training.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.800]   What I'm going to do, there's some questions coming in.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.520]   I'm going to go ahead and close this in prayer.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.760]   If you want to stay on, I'll stay on for five minutes or so
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.960]   to answer any questions that might come in,
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:51.320]   but we'll dismiss you tonight and let you go if you need to go.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.480]   Let me pray for us.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:56.680]   Father, thank you so much for our study.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.640]   We pray, Father, that you would help us
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.200]   to do the hard work of repentance ourselves,
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.440]   that we would repent of not just some forms of anger,
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.480]   but all of it, that we'd put it away,
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.880]   all bitterness, wrath, clamor, slander,
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.240]   that it would all be put away,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:17.320]   that we may receive with meekness the word of God,
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.240]   and that it may bear fruit in our lives.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.000]   I pray that you would train each of us
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.920]   to be instruments in the Redeemer's hands,
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.800]   that you would use us as you used Ted Tripp
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.520]   in his brother's life
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.080]   to bring about life transformation
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.680]   for the glory of God.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.840]   And we trust you for these things
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.360]   and pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.480]   Amen, God bless you.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.600]   If you have any questions,
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.040]   I'll hang on for a few more minutes.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.480]   Otherwise, you may be dismissed,
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.960]   but I'll answer some of the questions
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.440]   that are coming in on the Q and A.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.720]   The question came in,
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.240]   how do we truly submit anger and not stuff it inside?
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.760]   We may think we submit,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.080]   but in reality, we stuff the anger.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.360]   It's a great question.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.520]   I think that the question is relating to
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.200]   how do we truly deal with the anger
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.880]   that we have inside and not store it up,
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   I think would be the language that we might use.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.720]   And I do think that where we need to go
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   with James chapter four is asking that hard question
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   of what is the desire that is not being met
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.760]   here that is causing the anger.
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.080]   And I'm trying to think of some other examples in real life.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.320]   I'm giving you a lot of my own stories
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.240]   with the lasagna story and other stories.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:54.480]   But typically when you're angry,
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:59.040]   you are wanting something that you are not getting.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.040]   And the issue of dealing with that anger
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   is to submit that desire to the Lordship of Christ.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.880]   It's praying not my will, but your will be done.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.040]   And it may be that God's will for me
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.320]   is that I come home and the dishes aren't done
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.120]   or the living room is not clean.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.360]   I mean, that may be God's will for me as a father
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.200]   and to submit whatever desire that I have to the Lord
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.400]   and humble myself before him,
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.880]   I think is really the key to dealing
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.080]   with that type of sinful anger.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:48.120]   I'm not sure if that's answering the question,
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.680]   the specific issue there.
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.520]   But I do think that dealing with desire
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.920]   is the heart of life transformation.
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.920]   By the way, you need to view your corporate worship,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.640]   what you do on a Sunday morning
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   as a battle for sanctification.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.280]   That's what we're doing
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.080]   when we're singing these songs of worship,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.960]   reminding ourselves that only Christ is worth
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.440]   all of our heart's desires
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.400]   and all of our treasuring and valuing of our hearts.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.600]   Christ deserves it all.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.320]   And when you worship Christ in that way,
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.720]   then you can go home to possibly a family member
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.720]   who doesn't respect you
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.880]   and you can respond with grace and with kindness
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.120]   because you're not worshiping your own comfort
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.520]   or your own reputation.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.680]   You're worshiping Christ
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.360]   and out of the overflow of your relationship with Christ,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.240]   you can give to someone who is not giving to you.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:57.400]   So I hope that's a helpful answer to the question.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.000]   Well, God bless you all.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.080]   Have a wonderful week.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.760]   We'll be back here next Sunday at 5 p.m. Pacific time
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.160]   and looking at counseling exam number five.
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.160]   Have a wonderful week of study.
