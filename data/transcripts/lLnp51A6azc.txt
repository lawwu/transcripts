[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.400]   - So I know you believe as many do
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.680]   that we're far from creating
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.820]   an artificial general intelligence system.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.240]   But say once we do and you get to ask her one question,
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.760]   what would that question be?
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.020]   What is it that differentiates you and me?
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.460]   (laughs)
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.040]   (gentle music)
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.620]   (gentle music)
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.200]   (gentle music)
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.780]   (gentle music)
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.360]   (gentle music)
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.940]   (gentle music)
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:58.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
