[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   Today and Friday we field two different questions about premarital pregnancies, one involving
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.820]   a believer and an unbeliever, and another scenario involving two professing believers.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.700]   First this one, "Does a premarital pregnancy nullify Paul's unequally yoked prohibition?"
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.160]   The question arrives from a listener named Patrick, a pastor himself.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for how this podcast serves me as a pastor."
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760]   Love that.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.880]   "A young couple at my church is unmarried and they have a child together.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.120]   They're now living in a state of chastity apart.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.280]   The man is not a believer, she is.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   They plan to marry, though I have advised her not to marry him unless he becomes a believer."
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.600]   Based on Paul's words in 2 Corinthians 6, 14-18.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.120]   Categorically speaking, am I correct here, or does the bringing of a child together into
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.600]   the world override Paul's unequally yoked principle?
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.640]   Pastor John, what would you say about my pastoral instinct here?
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.920]   I think Patrick's interpretation and instincts are correct.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.480]   And I would simply add a few passages of Scripture and draw out some practical implications.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.280]   Patrick refers to 2 Corinthians 6, 14, "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers."
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.000]   Even more direct to this issue of marrying an unbeliever is Paul's instruction in 1
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.560]   Corinthians 7, 39, "A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.500]   dies she's free to be married to whom she wishes only in the Lord."
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:58.280]   So that's Paul's explicit statement, Christians only marry people in the Lord who are Christians.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.000]   And of course, behind these two commands for believers, "only to marry believers," is the
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.560]   wisdom that marriage ought to be built on the foundation of faith in Christ with all
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.840]   the challenges and goals of marriage shaped by the Lordship of Jesus Christ, which it
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.360]   can't be in a unity where one does not submit to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.560]   So I think these commands from the Apostles stand as the perpetual guide for marriage
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   in the Christian church, and that the fact that a person has had sex before marriage
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.920]   or even given birth to a child before marriage does not change this instruction.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.000]   Now in support of that conviction, I would point to 1 Corinthians 6, 15 following.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.280]   It goes like this, "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.760]   Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute?
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.840]   Never.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:18.320]   Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.480]   For as it is written, 'The two shall become one flesh.'"
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.960]   That's a quote from Genesis 2, 24.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.880]   But "he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him."
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.520]   Flee from sexual immorality.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   Now it seems to me that we can infer from this warning against sex outside marriage
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.080]   that Paul does not believe that such a sexual union creates a covenant.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:02.240]   And this is all the more striking, isn't it, because he says it does create a kind of one-flesh
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.200]   union even with a prostitute.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   And to support that, well, this is verse 16.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.440]   "Do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her?
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.320]   For," and then he quotes this amazing text that applies to marriage, "for the two will
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.880]   become one flesh."
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.200]   So if anywhere Paul is going to say that a person is bound to marry someone with whom
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   they have had a one-flesh union, this would be it.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.360]   Say it, Paul.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   Don't you mean that?
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.480]   And he doesn't.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.680]   He doesn't mean that.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.880]   Sexual union is precious, unique, profound, and intended by God as the consummation of
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   a marriage covenant, but by itself, isolated out there in some brothel or in some house
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.880]   at the beach as teenagers.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.040]   That isolated sexual encounter does not create a covenant.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.800]   Isolated from the marriage covenant, it doesn't create a marriage covenant.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.840]   And I think we can go one step further.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.240]   If a one-flesh union does not create a marriage covenant, then the fruit of that one-flesh
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.920]   union, namely a precious child, does not create a covenant either.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.500]   It doesn't create a marriage.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:39.320]   So it seems to me that the biblical instruction to only marry in the Lord stands, even though
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:48.600]   there has been a sexual union and even though there has been the fruit of that sexual union,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.080]   a child.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.760]   Now, of course, this raises enormously difficult issues.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.520]   Now the couple that Patrick refers to have already evidently walked through some of these
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.640]   difficulties.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   They've kept the baby alive and evidently are publicly known as having had sex together
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.880]   and produced this child, all of which, of course, must have been painful.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:27.760]   And now there are legal issues, of course, as a moral and legal question of who will
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.880]   be the primary parent of this child if they don't marry.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.760]   What kind of financial responsibilities are there for the parent who's not immediately
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.400]   raising the child if they don't marry?
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:50.080]   What kind of access will both parents have to the child if they don't marry?
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.920]   But here's the greatest pastoral challenge, perhaps.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:05.040]   Can you help this couple, especially the Christian woman, see 20 or 30 years into the future
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:14.000]   and what a 20 or 30-year marriage with an unbeliever will be like, or whether the marriage
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.720]   will even survive?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:24.520]   The present problems look much bigger to them right now than those distant problems.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   They're not.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   They're not.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   It is very difficult, probably, for this Christian young woman to imagine two or three years
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.680]   from now falling in love with a different man who's a Christian and having a 50-year
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.720]   marriage of unity and common faith with him.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:52.680]   But that is what she should dream about, or, if not, waiting prayerfully for the Lord to
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.880]   give new life to this child's father.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.640]   There are no easy answers to the circumstances created by sin.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:10.540]   So may God give you, Patrick, great wisdom as you counsel them, and may he give this
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:19.920]   Christian woman, especially, grace and courage and far-seeing vision to act wisely.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.560]   Very good, measured counsel for a principled question.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.200]   And Pastor Patrick really serves as a model of how to ask a question to us.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.780]   We can't untangle the personal dimensions of all these questions, but we can address
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.880]   the biblical principles that could be in play in any given situation.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.720]   And of course, it's always great to hear that this podcast is serving pastors of local churches.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.880]   That is just a phenomenal answer to prayer.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.280]   Thanks to all the pastors who listen out there.
