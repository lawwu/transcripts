[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   I'm sure that I'm expressing the feelings of all of us who are visitors here this afternoon
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.200]   when I say that it's a great privilege to all of us to be invited and to be asked to
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.400]   come here and to share with the friends in this church and our friend the Minister in
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.600]   particular the happiness and the joy of this unique occasion and I'm sure that I'm further
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   expressing the feelings of my fellow visitors when I say that we shall endeavour to remember
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   you who worship here regularly both Minister, officers and people in our prayers that your
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:57.200]   witness may be a very powerful one in this new episode, this new period in the history
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.400]   of this church. It is indeed something for which all of us who stand for the faith at
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.160]   a time like this should thank God and in which we should rejoice.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.640]   Now I'd like to call your attention on this occasion to the words that are to be found
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.080]   in the book of Joshua in chapter 4 beginning to read at verse 21 and going on to the end
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.120]   of the chapter verses 21 to 24 in the fourth chapter of the book of Joshua and he spake
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.400]   unto the children of Israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.560]   come saying what mean these stones then ye shall let your children know saying Israel
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   came over this Jordan on dry land for the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.500]   from before you until ye were passed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea which
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.240]   he dried up from before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:29.440]   know the hand of the Lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the Lord your God forever.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.840]   Now these words come in this chapter which of course is a very important and vital chapter
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.520]   in the history of the children of Israel. You remember how the children of Israel had
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   had to go down to Egypt because of a famine that had arisen in their land and they had
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.760]   dwelt there and for a while had been very prosperous but times had changed and they'd
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.680]   become slaves in the land of Egypt and were completely helpless but God had raised a man
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.400]   called Moses and he had led them out of the bondage and the captivity. It was a very precarious
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.360]   enterprise because they were soon face to face with the Red Sea and they had to cross
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   it and they could not do so. There was the Red Sea and the armies of Pharaoh behind them
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.040]   and the situation seemed not only desperate but impossible. Then God worked a miracle.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.400]   He divided the Red Sea as we are reminded here. The children of Israel crossed on dry
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:45.920]   land but the moment that Pharaoh and his hosts and chariots and horses tried to do the same
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.600]   the waters closed in again and they were all drowned and finally discomfited. Then God
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.880]   had led these people for 40 years through a wilderness and had fed them in a miraculous
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   manner by giving them the manna and now here comes in many ways the climactic point. They
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.520]   are on the verge of entering Canaan, the chosen land, but they've got to cross the river
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:22.320]   of Jordan and it seems to have been in flood at this particular time. But God again worked
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   a miracle. He divided the river Jordan exactly as he divided the Red Sea and the people were
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.060]   able to cross over on dry land and enter into the promised land. But God did a very interesting
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:49.600]   thing here. He commanded Joshua to call out 12 leaders of the 12 tribes of Israel and
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.520]   that he was to command these men, each one of them, to pick up a stone from the middle
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.560]   of the bed of the river Jordan and each man was to carry this stone on his shoulder into
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.600]   the new land, Canaan. Then they were to set up these stones as pillars outside a place
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:20.720]   called Gilgal and this was done. And in the verses that I'm going to consider with you,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.720]   we are given the reason why this was to be done, why these men were to take up a stone
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.560]   each and why these 12 stones were to be set up outside Gilgal. And the reason is this,
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:43.040]   it's to be done because when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   what mean these stones? Then you shall let your children know saying, Israel came over
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.660]   this Jordan, which was there quite near on dry land. For the Lord your God dried up the
[00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.120]   waters of Jordan from before you until you were passed over as the Lord your God did
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.400]   to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us until we were gone over. Why? That the
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:16.920]   people of the earth, that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:25.640]   that it is mighty and that you might fear the Lord your God forever.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.820]   Well now, I feel that this is an appropriate incident in the life and the story of the
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:40.780]   children of Israel for us to consider on this interesting occasion. Here is a new building
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:47.020]   and people will be walking around here and passing by and in a few days probably and
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.940]   in the years to come, people will stand outside and look at the building and at the notice
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:05.300]   board and they will say, what is this? What is this building? What is this Immanuel Evangelical
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   Church Baptist? What does it mean? What is it about? There are many buildings in Newport
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:21.020]   and there are many new buildings which have been put up in Newport in these last years.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.900]   And people pass by and they look and they say, well, what is this for? One is called
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:33.180]   a Masonic Lodge, another is called an Institute and so on. But here is this building, this
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:41.700]   new building. And they will ask the question, what mean these stones? What is the message
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.720]   of this building? If any one of you who are members here should be asked by somebody passing
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:55.180]   by, what mean these stones? What is it to be the answer? Well, I suggest that the answers
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.340]   are these and they are all here. I am not going to impart any. I am simply going to
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:08.060]   expound what we are told in these verses for I believe that what we are told here is exactly
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:15.380]   what we should be saying in reply to the same question that is put to us at this present
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:23.220]   time. What does this building represent? Well, the first answer is exactly like those stones
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:35.900]   outside Gilgal, they point to history, to certain historical events and happenings.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.140]   And this I sometimes think is perhaps one of the most important things of which we need
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:50.980]   to remind ourselves at the present time. Our Christian faith is based entirely upon
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:58.840]   history. And this is where the Christian faith differs from everything else that is being
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.260]   offered to men and women in the midst of our modern troubles. Let me put it to you like
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:13.660]   this. Christianity is not a philosophy. What is a philosophy? Well, a philosophy is ideas
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:19.940]   put forward by men in an attempt to try to understand life and our problems and how to
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:27.020]   deal with them and how to solve them. It is a matter of ideas, of thoughts and of teachings.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.840]   The point is that while there is obviously a teaching and a doctrine which is a vital
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.140]   part of Christianity, that is not the first thing. What differentiates this is that it
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:47.260]   is first and foremost a record of historical events and historical facts. What mean these
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:54.060]   stones outside Gilgal? Oh, what they mean is that certain things happen to these people,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:59.940]   history. Let's be clear about this. There are so many people today who talk about the
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:08.580]   Christian attitude towards war and peace, Christian attitude towards education, Christian
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:18.900]   attitude towards art and drama and literature. Now all that tends to turn it into a philosophy,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:26.660]   into a teaching, into a theory, into a point of view. But that is rarely not to be true
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:33.020]   to our position. So Christianity, we must remember, is not one of a number of theories
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:40.100]   and ideas and philosophies with respect to life. It is quite unique because it is teaching
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:46.160]   which is based upon history. I can go further and I can say this, that this is the thing
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:55.780]   which differentiates the Christian faith from religion, from any kind of religion. You take
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.220]   these religions that people, some of them are turning to at the present time, Buddhism
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:08.420]   or Confucianism or Hinduism or any one of these isms. What are they? Well, they are
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:17.580]   all something invented by men. They are all teachings. They involve a kind of worship,
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:24.340]   but they are not based upon facts and upon events. They are all based upon ideas and
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.620]   they are ideas that are supposed to lead you and to help you to arrive at the particular
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:38.480]   deity that you want to worship. Now here again you see our Christian faith is entirely different.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:46.700]   It calls attention to facts and that is why this building in a sense is going to do exactly
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:54.100]   the same as the bread and the wine do in a communion service. They again are calling
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:02.300]   attention to facts. So we must start with this all important matter, principle, and
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:10.860]   realise that it is vital to our whole situation. The uniqueness of the Christian faith depends
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:20.780]   upon a series of historical facts and events and the teaching which results from that.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:29.500]   But let me hurry to the second point which is this. These facts, these events on which
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:40.580]   our whole position are based are not the result of man's action, but God's action. You see
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.620]   the stones outside Gilgal are not to call attention to anything the children of Israel
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:52.020]   did. They are to call attention to what God did with the children of Israel. They are
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:13:01.220]   memorials pointing people, reminding people of actions, events, historical happenings
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:10.540]   which have been produced by Almighty God. The whole emphasis is upon that. And so you
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:17.180]   see we need to be reminded of this and we need to remind others of this. People still
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:24.460]   persist in thinking that you can make yourself a Christian and that it is as the result of
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.660]   certain good actions and deeds that you've done that you become a Christian. That if
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.340]   a man is going to arrive in heaven, well it's going to be the result of the life he's
[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:39.500]   lived and what he has done. This of course is the great characteristic of the age in
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:46.540]   which we live. It not only forgets and doesn't believe in God, it doesn't believe in the
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:53.660]   supernatural at all. The whole emphasis is upon man and the achievements of man and we
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:14:01.060]   are glorying in what man does scientifically, putting people on the moon. These wonderful
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:07.580]   discoveries man, great man, and what man has done. That's the whole trouble with the world
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:13.340]   today isn't it? That it's only interested in men and interested in what men has done
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:20.220]   and what men is doing and what men can do and what men we hope is going to do. The whole
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:28.060]   emphasis is upon man and his actions. The uniqueness of our position, the unique message
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:35.000]   of this building is this. That though men have erected this building, what it's pointing
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.420]   to is what God has done. What the Almighty has done, not man. It's a record of the activities
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:49.780]   of God. So the Bible you see starts by saying in the beginning God, not in the beginning
[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:58.100]   man, in the beginning God. And the Bible is rarely nothing but a great record of what
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:04.900]   God has done. So this building is to point to that. And you see this building can be
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.880]   a very powerful evangelistic force therefore, if we only give the right answer to the questions.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.580]   When the man or the boy asks outside, "What's the meaning of this building? What mean these
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:22.540]   stones?" "Ah," you say, "this is a monument to what God has done. The activity of God
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:29.780]   in the midst of this evil present world as in the past." But let's go further. Let's
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:39.100]   go on. Let's analyze what we are told in our statement. It's a record in particular of
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:47.220]   God's redemptive acts. Not only his acts in general, it does, as I've just quoted, it
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:53.780]   does tell you about creation. But you know the real theme of the Bible is not creation,
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:59.700]   it's redemption. You have the preliminary account of course of creation in the fall
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:06.300]   as I'm going to show you, in order in a sense that you might know why redemption has ever
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.860]   become necessary. But the glory of the message in this book and what this building is going
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:22.860]   to proclaim is God's acts of redemption, deliverance, and of salvation. That's what we are told
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:28.820]   here. Israel came over this Jordan and dry land for the Lord your God dried up the waters
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:34.420]   of Jordan as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea when he dried up from the forest until
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:41.300]   we were gone over. What's it mean? Well, as I told you in my little brief synopsis at
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:50.580]   the beginning, it's the story of the deliverance and the redemption of the children of Israel
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:57.540]   from the bondage and the captivity of Egypt. It's customary and rightly so for us to regard
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.860]   that story as a kind of picture and a foreshadowing of the great redemption in Christ Jesus. Now
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:14.900]   you remember the essence of that story. Here as I say, were these children of Israel. They'd
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:21.220]   become slaves. They were suffering under a cruel bondage. The cruel taskmasters with
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.340]   their whips were whipping them and getting them to produce more and more bricks without
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:32.740]   providing the straw that was necessary. It was a sad, it was a sorry condition. They
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:38.420]   were helpless and they were hopeless. They could do nothing at all. They were under a
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.900]   very powerful monarch, the Pharaoh, with all his chariots and his horses and his military
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.460]   men and all their great culture. And yet were these poor people, the children of Israel,
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:59.500]   completely helpless, absolutely hopeless? But the story is that God intervened. God
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:06.300]   did something and what he did was to deliver them and to bring them out of that and take
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.580]   them through the Red Sea and the Jordan and to put them in the land of promise, the land
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:19.620]   flowing with milk and honey. Now then, that's what these stones are saying outside Gilgal.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.420]   And you and I must make clear that people understand that that is what this building
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:30.900]   is announcing. This building is a proclamation of the fact that God has acted and intervened
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:39.420]   in this world in the salvation of men and women. But we don't merely make a statement.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:46.860]   We've got to start by saying, "Why has God done this? Why was it ever necessary that
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:54.420]   it should be done at all?" Because it's no use just going to people and saying, "Jesus
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   loves you. Jesus saves you." They don't know they need to be saved. The Bible is very
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:06.220]   careful to tell us this. We know how the children of Israel had got into their miserable condition
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:12.780]   of bondage and of captivity. And it is our business to tell the modern men why he is
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:19.620]   in such grievous trouble, why his world is tormented this afternoon, why we are in a
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:28.260]   state of great crisis. What's it due to? Well, our answer is that all this is due to
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:35.620]   the fact that men and women are the slaves of the devil, that they're being governed
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:42.180]   and controlled by the God of this world, the Prince of the power of the air, the Spirit
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:48.900]   that now worketh in the children of disobedience. How have they ever got into this condition?
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:54.580]   This is the condition. Men and women are not free. They talk about freedom. Never have
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:02.540]   there been such slaves. Slaves to the newspaper, slaves to the television, slaves to the wireless,
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:08.700]   slaves to the thing to do, slaves to advertising, like sheep, all doing the same thing. That's
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:16.380]   sheer slavery. Well, how did they ever get into that condition? The history gives us
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:23.900]   the answer. It was because men whom God had created in his own image and likeness, in
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:31.740]   his folly, in his arrogance and pride, rebelled against God and wanted to be equal with God
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:38.580]   and thereby fell and put himself in bondage to Satan. He listened to the suggestion and
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:46.100]   the temptation of Satan and so he became the slave of Satan. And the whole of humanity
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:52.100]   is born in sin and shaped in iniquity. This has been the sad story of the human race,
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:57.500]   conscious of some strange bondage, anxious to get out of it but never able to do so.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:06.740]   The whole world is in slavery to the devil and sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:13.820]   And we must tell them further that we, by nature, are all as helpless as the children
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:22.780]   of Israel were in their physical bondage in Egypt. No man can conquer the devil. Our Lord
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:28.820]   describes him as the strong man arm that keepeth his goods at peace. Men have tried to liberate
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.260]   themselves from the devil. Men try to put an end to bad habits and practices. You can
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:41.220]   take any resolutions but you can't keep them. We are weak. None of us can do this.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.220]   The law was given to the children of Israel. They couldn't keep it. The law could not do
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:52.460]   because it was weak in the flesh. Try as it will, mankind can't emancipate itself. Oh,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.520]   the tragedy of the last hundred years when people in their folly thought that education
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.100]   would set us free, that emancipation was to be found in greater knowledge and greater
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:10.220]   travel facilities and so on. But it all proved to be useless. The slavery and the bondage
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.020]   are as great this afternoon as they've ever been.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:19.500]   Well, now, here is a world in an apparently hopeless condition governed by what? Greed
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:26.380]   and envy and jealousy and envy. We are seeing it today. It's true of everybody. It's not
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.460]   true of one class of society only. There are politicians who would have us believe that
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.780]   it's only the working men who's greedy and wants more money. The others at the other
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.900]   end are equally guilty. They all love money. The millionaire loves money. The man who'd
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:48.980]   like to be a millionaire loves money also. And the whole trouble is that we are in bondage
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:55.540]   to sin and to sit and we are slaves to the lusts and the passions of the flesh and of
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:03.820]   the mind and we cannot set ourselves free. What's this building for? What's it pronouncing?
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:09.980]   The message of this building is this, that God has done something about this bondage
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:16.920]   of ours exactly as he did with the physical bondage of the children of Israel of old.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:25.460]   This is Christianity. God's acts of redemption, God's eruptions into time, God coming in
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   and delivering us there amongst the flesh pots of Egypt and in the utter hopelessness
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.420]   of our spiritual despair. And this is the great message, of course, and the great record
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:45.220]   of the Bible as I've said. Let me just note to you some of these great acts of God. What
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:50.140]   mean these stones? Oh, what these stones mean is this, that God brought the children of
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:56.220]   Israel through the Red Sea on dry land. He's brought them through this Jordan on dry land.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.580]   God's done it. The facts. What are the facts of God's redemption in a spiritual sense?
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:11.060]   Well, the first, of course, happened in the Garden of Eden itself. The woman and the man
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:18.220]   have listened to the subtle temptation of the devil and they've acted and they've rebelled.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:25.780]   And at once they know they're wrong. And then they suddenly hear the voice of the Lord God
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:33.700]   in the garden in the cool of the day. And he called out to them, "Adam, where art thou?
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:42.960]   God has come down to man in his folly, his shame, his misery, his bondage. God has come
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.100]   down." He didn't leave him there. He didn't say, "Very well, carry on, let things go on
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:57.020]   as they are." And they would have festered to putrefaction. God came down. Why did he
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.700]   come down? Well, he came down not only to tell them the punishment he was going to mete
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:09.340]   out upon their sin and their folly. He came down to tell them that he'd got a plan of
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:16.100]   redemption for the whole race. There's not only going to be warfare and strife between
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:22.060]   the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, the great promise, the protovangel,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:27.860]   the first intimation of God's salvation, the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.660]   head. But God came down. He came into history to make the declaration. Now that's the first
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:39.260]   one. I'm only going to pick out some of the most striking ones. You remember the history
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:47.160]   of the flood. That's fact. That is history. The ancient world had got into such a state
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:53.040]   that God said there's nothing to be done but to judge it. And the whole world was condemned
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:03.820]   and destroyed apart from eight souls, one family. God condemned, destroyed. God gave
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:12.700]   a new start, a new beginning in this great story. And on it goes. Think then of what
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.820]   happened at the Tower of Babel. When men thought again they were going to be equal with God
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:25.860]   and they could arrive in heaven, God shattered it all and confused their languages. And the
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:32.060]   whole world was in a state of confusion. But God again did an amazing thing. He acted.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:38.500]   He intervened. He took hold of a man whose name was Abram, who lived in Ur of the Chaldeans,
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.260]   and who was a pagan. He took hold of this man and he said, "I'm going to turn you into
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:48.540]   a nation. I'm going to make my own people out of you. And you are going to represent
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:54.260]   me. You're going to bear a message. And ultimately, through you and your seed, all the nations
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:01.460]   of the world are going to be blessed." God intervening. This is salvation. This is Christianity.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:07.380]   God is now going to form a nation so that through this nation he can teach all other
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:13.580]   nations and condemn them and eventually offer them his great salvation. So it's again, you
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:19.660]   see, an act and an action of God. This is Christianity. Not some vague philosophy or
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:25.580]   some idea or some attitude, but God coming down and coming in. I'm simply picking out
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:32.340]   the salient features. The children of Israel came into being. God's people. They were different
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.860]   from every other nation. But as I've reminded you, in their folly, they didn't appreciate
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:43.260]   that. And they wanted to be like the others. And they became like the others. And the result
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:49.100]   of that was that God not only abandoned them, but he raised an enemy to conquer them. And
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.580]   they were carried away as captives to Babylon. And there they are again, in utter and complete
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:00.940]   helplessness and hopelessness and bondage. Slaves in Babylon. And you'd have thought
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:06.460]   that that was the end of them. And it would have been, were it not that God acts. And
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:13.380]   God delivered them. And he brought back a remnant. It's the action of God once more.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.060]   And then he raised those great prophets to encourage them and to tell them that a great
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:25.180]   deliverer was going to come. God sent them. These men didn't have a sudden idea. The prophets
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.780]   were not philosophers. They didn't suddenly have a brilliant theory. God gave them a message.
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:37.020]   The burden of the Lord came to me. This is what they all say. It's God acting. And it
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:44.860]   leads up, of course, to that amazing man, John the Baptist. And remember the way in
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:53.660]   which the Bible introduces John the Baptist. Emphasizing the point I made at the beginning,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.900]   that we're dealing with history, my friends. This is how John the Baptist is introduced.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:03.220]   In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. This is not a theory. This is not
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:09.420]   a story. This is not a fairy tale or a romance. It's something that happened in the fifteenth
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:15.380]   year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. Pontius Pilate being governor of Gibeau. And you get
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:21.420]   all these other men. Tetrax in Galilee and Aeturaeus and Trachonitis and all. The word
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:30.660]   of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. God spoke. It's God acting.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:38.780]   And he gave that man that message. And he was the great forerunner. But that is entirely
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:50.540]   eclipsed by something else. When the fullness of the times had come, God, it's always God.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:56.980]   God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   the law. We are not here to say what man has arrived at in his thinking and theorizing
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.040]   as to how we can serve God and please him. It's the exact opposite. It's God seeking
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:15.500]   lost men. It's God bringing and putting into operation his plan of redemption and of salvation.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:21.660]   And here is the supreme act. He sends his own son into the world. In the fullness of
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:29.060]   the times, it was all predetermined, but it's arrived. God so loved the world that he gave.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:37.180]   He sent into it his only begotten son. I mustn't keep you, my friends. But I'm so anxious that
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:43.780]   we should realize that our whole position depends upon these facts. It's not a teaching.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:50.740]   It's facts primarily, historical events, which have their teaching inevitably. And so you
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:54.260]   must go through all the facts about our Lord. When a man asks you, "What's the meaning of
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.540]   this building? What's the meaning of this word evangelical? What's the meaning of Emmanuel?"
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.860]   "Ah," you say, "this is the only hope of the world today. It's all about that man called
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:10.660]   Jesus of Nazareth. Do you know who he was?" This was the only begotten son of God. This
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:18.060]   was the perfect likeness and image of God, the eternal father. This was God's own son.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.660]   This is the most amazing thing that's ever happened in the whole course of human history,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:28.700]   that God has been manifest in the flesh and has dwelt among us. This is fact. That's why
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:38.700]   you call this 1977. It's a fact. And the facts of his perfect life, his miracles, his teaching,
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:47.620]   yes, but above all, the fact of the cross, the event that took place on a hill called
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:53.900]   Calvary. What's that? "Ah," says the world, "that was the death of a pacifist, wasn't
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.300]   it? He was a pure man and he didn't believe in war or in force or in strife. The world
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.420]   didn't understand him as they hadn't understood Socrates, as they never understand their own
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:11.340]   greatest men, and they put him to death, the death of a great pacifist or a great teacher.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:21.180]   No, no. God has made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:28.820]   righteousness of God in him." What was happening? God has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:34.780]   It was God acting on Calvary. It wasn't men with their hands actually nailed him, but
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:40.860]   he didn't die because of that. It was God. He was the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:53.420]   sin of the world. It was God smiting him instead of us. It was God reconciling the world unto
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:00.900]   himself. It is God acting on Calvary as he acts everywhere. But he died and they took
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.660]   down his body and they buried it in a grave. And it would have been the end of the story,
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:13.860]   but for one thing, God raised him from the dead. God raised him. Then he ascended into
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:18.500]   heaven and took his seat at the right hand in the glory everlasting.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:24.300]   Well, now these, you see, are the facts to which this building is the bared witness.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:30.900]   That's its purpose, to tell men and women that this has happened and why it has happened.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   It's a part of God's way of delivering us and of saving us and of giving us a new life.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.980]   But you know, it didn't stop even there. There was a great event on the day of Pentecost
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:47.180]   in Jerusalem, and we mustn't forget this. This is in a sense when the Christian church
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:53.900]   as we know her and as this building is going to represent and to contain a Christian church,
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900]   the Christian church in a sense was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. What happened then?
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:04.180]   Well, here were these men. They'd got the message. They knew who he was. God sent the
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:10.260]   Spirit upon them. They had met together to pray. That's what they could do. But you know,
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.300]   we are here this afternoon because of this. While these men were praying and were waiting,
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:23.100]   suddenly there was a sound of a mighty rushing wind. What's this? Oh, it's God. It's the
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:30.620]   Spirit coming. God has shed forth his Spirit, sent forth his mighty power. He promised to
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:37.260]   do so, and he does so. And so the Spirit came down upon the church, and these simple ignorant
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:42.860]   men were enabled to preach with authority and power, 3,000 converted in one day on the
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:48.620]   day of Pentecost and added to the church. The joyful story of the early Christian church.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:54.100]   It didn't stop at that. They got into difficulties. God came in, intervened in the miracles that
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:59.940]   follow, the miraculous escapes from prisons and various other places. And the whole thing
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:06.060]   is alive with the activity of God, acts of the apostles we say. In a sense it's right,
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.420]   but you know, I agree with the men who suggested that that book should be called The Acts of
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:18.020]   the Holy Ghost. The Spirit came upon Peter, and he spoke with authority. The Spirit came
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:25.260]   upon Paul, and he healed men. It's the action of God. And we don't stop even at the end
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:34.740]   of the New Testament canon. Do you know why we are here this afternoon? I can tell you.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:40.540]   It's entirely due to the activity of God. The church, like the children of Israel of
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:46.140]   old, constantly goes astray. They forget their origin, they forget their message, they even
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:51.540]   deny it. They want to become like the world, and we've known that in this century. Churches
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.980]   having wrist drives and dances and wanting to be like clubs and institutions, as Mr.
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:01.820]   Harrison was telling us. And the church would long ago have ceased to exist, were it not
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:08.220]   for one thing. What's that? The interventions of God in history in what we call revivals.
[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:16.180]   Look at it. Protestant Reformation. Suddenly, into the midst of the chaos and the deadness,
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:22.380]   God comes, raises up a Martin Luther and many others. And this is how the cause has been
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:29.260]   kept going. And I say that's why we are here this afternoon. It is this series of interventions
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:36.700]   of God. He's come in and he's carried on these great acts of redemption. And so we find ourselves
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.980]   here this afternoon. That's what these stones are saying. That's the message of this building.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:49.100]   But let me say just a word about the character of these acts of God. It's emphasized here.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:56.460]   They're the acts of God. The wonderful works of God that the apostles were speaking about
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.020]   on the day of Pentecost and the people could hear them in their various languages. But
[00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:11.060]   think of the character of the acts. And here, this is emphasized. Miraculous. Supernatural.
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:20.340]   What mean these stones? The answer is Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. What? Can
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:29.660]   you come over a river on dry land? Israel came through the Red Sea on dry land. Impossible.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:38.940]   Yes, with men. But it happened. Why? Because it was a miracle. The acts of God are supernatural
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:47.920]   and they are miraculous acts. These were phenomena. And we are to tell people that our faith is
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.740]   based upon phenomena and it's a phenomenon in and of itself. What does this mean? Well,
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.940]   we've got to tell people this quite plainly. Our position as Christians differs from that
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:09.860]   of everybody else. You're a politician. He addresses a company of people and he puts his
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:16.500]   program before them and he appeals to their reason. Asks them to vote for it. He's demonstrated
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.300]   it. He's shown it to them. And they're capable of understanding and following the argument
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:27.860]   and they vote for him. We have got to start by telling people that our message is such
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:37.400]   that they cannot understand it. It is entirely different from everything that is confronting
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:44.260]   mankind this afternoon. It is a spiritual message, a supernatural message. We say to
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:50.300]   them, "Look here, you won't understand this." A great man called Nicodemus thought he could
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.580]   understand it and he went to see our Lord to have an explanation of it. And our Lord
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:00.300]   answered him at once and said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, though you are a great teacher
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:09.100]   of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:15.500]   the kingdom of God. All you've got is useless. What is born of the flesh is flesh. That which
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:21.060]   is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, 'He must be born again.'
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.780]   Don't be surprised at this. Why? Well, here's the answer. The wind bloweth where it listeth,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.020]   though hearest the sound thereof, but thou canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit. The whole thing is miraculous.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:43.100]   It's supernatural. It's God intervening. It's not man striving. It's God coming down. It's
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:50.460]   not human ingenuity. It is divine wisdom. And the natural man receiveth not the things of
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:57.100]   the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him. Neither can he know them, for they
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:03.740]   are spiritually discerned. We've got to tell people this. It's a supernatural. It is a
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:10.460]   miraculous message. It is God acting above nature, not contradicting it, acting above
[00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:17.260]   it and showing his lordship over it. And this is true of the whole story of the church.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:23.860]   You see, the people of Israel, the nation of Israel, it was a miracle nation. Israel
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.700]   was unlike every other nation. It had been created out of one man. That wasn't true of
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:36.020]   any other nation. Their whole history is miraculous and supernatural. So is the life of our Lord.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.940]   So is the origin of the church. So is the continuation of the church as I've been showing
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:48.140]   you. And so is the case with every one of us who is truly Christian. You can take up
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:54.700]   religion. You cannot take up Christianity. It takes you up. It apprehends us, as Paul
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.340]   tells the Philippians. He was apprehended, arrested. God in Christ intervened in his
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.100]   life on the road to Damascus. He would never have understood it. He was opposed to it.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.940]   But something was done to him. He was made a new man. He's a miracle. Every Christian
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:18.180]   is a miracle. And so that is what this building is to proclaim. Not only the acts and the
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:25.260]   works of God, but their character, that they are miraculous and supernatural. And this
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.420]   comes out again in those revivals to which I've been referring. Every Christian is a
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:40.260]   phenomenon and every revival is a great phenomenon. You can't explain it. You can't understand
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:45.540]   it. People have tried to do so, but they cannot do so. William Sargent thought he could do
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:51.020]   it, but he couldn't. He completely failed. He doesn't understand this. He says it's a
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.700]   sort of conditioned reflex. You do this and that will happen. It isn't so. I've known
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:01.300]   many men who, acting on that principle, thought they could produce revival by having all nights
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:06.460]   of prayer or something else. Poor fellows. They've died exhausted and the revival hasn't
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:12.780]   come. No, it's God alone who can do it. And it is miraculous and it is supernatural. It's
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:18.460]   a phenomenon. It's something that amazes men and causes them to cry out as those people
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:25.500]   did on the day of Pentecost. What is this? What is this? They ask that question there
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:30.980]   as these people ask the question about the stones outside Gilgal and as they should ask
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:37.140]   about this building. Very well. That brings me to my last point, which is this. What then
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:44.260]   is all this to convey to people? What is the message that this building is to convey? The
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:50.780]   answer that we give to the question, what mean these stones? And you know it's all summarized
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:57.980]   here in a very terrifying manner. That all the people of the earth might know the hand
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:05.500]   of the Lord, that it is mighty. And that you, children of Israel, Christian people, might
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:13.980]   fear the Lord your God forever. What's this building proclaiming here in Newport? Well,
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:22.820]   I think we've got to put it first. It's proclaiming judgment. It's to remind this godless generation
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:31.140]   that God still is. And that this world is his, not ours. And to tell them that it's
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:38.180]   under judgment. Well, you say, where's that in your text? Oh, I can tell you. Go back
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:45.340]   to the incident of the Red Sea, which is emphasized here. Pharaoh and his people had been maltreating
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:51.900]   the children of Israel and they had all power. And who were these people, these nobodies?
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:59.020]   But suddenly these nobodies are led out by this man Moses. And here they are, Piahareth
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:05.740]   and Beelzebub, one each side of them. The horse of Pharaoh behind them, the Red Sea
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:12.060]   in front of them. God divides the Red Sea and in they go and through. And Pharaoh in
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:17.380]   his confidence said to himself, what they can do, I can do. He thought he was only dealing
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:22.780]   with men and he didn't listen to their warnings, the warnings of Moses about this almighty
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:30.060]   God. And they went boldly into the sea. And what happened to them? They were all destroyed.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:36.500]   The judgment of God, the deliverance of the children of Israel miraculously through the
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:43.460]   Red Sea is not only indicative of God's power to save, it is equally indicative of
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:50.060]   God's power to judge and to condemn. And the whole world is under his judgment at this
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:57.100]   moment. And we are here to tell the people to flee from the wrath to come. We are here
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.940]   to tell them that judgment is abroad in the land. That's why everything is breaking
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.580]   down and is failing. Approximating the condition before the flood when God intervened in the
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:15.820]   flood and in destruction, judgment. And God is again saying this, you're going to be
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:21.700]   blessed, says Joshua. What mean these stones? Well, tell them, tell those children that
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.980]   God manifested the glory of his power upon Pharaoh and his hosts. And he'll do the
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:33.780]   same to anybody who were opposed to his people and opposed to him. The evil are simply waiting
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:40.340]   for the day of destruction. There are many reserved in chains of darkness waiting for
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:47.220]   the great day when the Son of God will come again and judge the whole world in righteousness.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:54.940]   The hand of the Lord. And it's a mighty hand. And nobody can withstand him. Nobody
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.980]   can avoid death. Nobody can avoid the judgment that is to follow. Tell the people when they
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.820]   ask what's the meaning? This is announcing the judgment that's about to come upon the
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:14.260]   whole world. Judgment. But thank God there's another element here. That all the people
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:22.140]   of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty. Thank God it is. And because
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:32.220]   salvation depends upon God, there is power sufficient to save anybody. I'm not ashamed
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:39.300]   of the gospel of Christ, says Paul. Why? It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:45.780]   that believeth. You see, before you can be a philosopher, you must have some brains.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:50.260]   Because you can derive, before you can derive benefit from Plato, Socrates, etc., you've
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.540]   got to have the capacity to follow them. The glory of this salvation is this. It depends
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:01.780]   upon the power of God. Not on our power. Not on our understanding. Not on our goodness.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:08.500]   Not on anything in us. It's the power of God. So that if a poor fellow, drunk, stands outside
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   this building and asks one of you members of this church, "What's the meaning of this
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:19.660]   building? What's this Immanuel Evangelical Church? What's it mean?" You can say to him,
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:25.780]   "My friend, it means this. That there is a power that can deliver you from the slavery
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:32.220]   of drink. There is a power that can make you not only a new man, a sober man. It can turn
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:38.820]   you into a saint." That's the message. That it's the power of God. That when education
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.500]   and culture and all medicine and everything else fail to deal with your alcoholics and
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:48.580]   your drug addicts and things which are even worse, God can do it. He's been doing it through
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:55.740]   the centuries. He's still doing it. So you tell them, "Believe in this God. Come to him."
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:48:04.820]   The power of God. This is what it's proclaiming. At the hand of the Lord. That it is mighty.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:11.140]   So we've got a gospel that we can offer to all and sundry. It's not a place for respectable
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:20.300]   nice people only. The vilest sinner can come in. And we can say to him, "Ere since by faith
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:27.460]   I saw the streams, this flowing wound supply, redeeming love has been my theme and shall
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:34.820]   be till I die. The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day. And here am
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:46.820]   I as vile as he may wash my sins away." We preach a hope to all in a hopeless world as
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:55.800]   it is this afternoon. And the last note is this. It's the certainty of the completeness
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:04.100]   of God's plan and purpose. All these actions and activities of God, of course, have been
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.260]   the carrying out of a great plan and purpose which he determined before he'd even created
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:14.460]   the world. And this is but the record of how he's been carrying it out in parts and portions
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:21.260]   throughout the centuries. But he's going to finish it. It's going to be complete. But
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.620]   you say, "Is there any hope for Christianity with militant communism and atheism and the
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:31.620]   materialism and the humanism and all the learning of today and all these things that keep people
[00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:37.220]   from church? Is there any future? Are these people here mad to put up this building?"
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:43.220]   The answer is, if it were their activities, it would be sheer madness and a tragic waste
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:54.580]   of money. But they're here because it is God's work. And God's work no one can frustrate.
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:50:04.900]   No one can spoil. God is almighty, the hand of the Lord. It is mighty. And the moment
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:15.780]   he arises, he'll blow upon communism, aristocracy, humanism, everyism, and they'll just vanish
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:24.060]   out of sight. They'll pass away. There'll be nothing left with God. The God who's acted,
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:29.660]   as the history tells us, and has worked miracles and has done the impossible and has destroyed
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:35.820]   the pharaohs and every other enemy, he will destroy every enemy.
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:42.780]   And as certain as we are here this afternoon, the day is coming when Jesus shall reign.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:51.340]   Where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run, his kingdom stretch from shore to shore
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:51:01.180]   till moons shall wax and wane no more. Christian people, lift up your heads, lift up your hearts,
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:17.580]   lift up your voices. Rejoice in the Lord God almighty and in his mighty, almighty hand.
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:25.180]   That's the message of this building. So that whenever anybody asks you, "What's this? What's
[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:34.420]   it mean?" That's what you'll say. It's God. What he has done, what he is doing, and what
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:45.660]   he's going to do. Do you know him? Have you submitted and fallen under his almighty hand
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:54.420]   to escape judgment and to receive his great salvation? May God enable our dear friends
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:52:02.540]   who will meet here regularly to answer the question in that great and glorious manner
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:07.020]   to the honor and the glory of God. Let us pray.
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:16.580]   O Lord our God, we come to thee again and we thank thee, O Lord, for this occasion.
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:22.940]   To us but a milestone on this great journey that thou hast set for thy people, not only
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:31.060]   this people, but thy people from the very beginning. We thank thee that it reminds us
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:38.300]   of who thou art and who we are, and that we are thine and that the church is thine, and
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:46.940]   that the gates of hell shall not prevail against us. Lord, open our eyes to the glorious power
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:56.260]   of thy right hand. May we take the warning that even we must not rebel against thee or
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:05.620]   fail to serve thee. Open our eyes, O Lord, and enable us to rejoice more than ever in
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:16.500]   this hour so great salvation. Hear us in Christ Jesus' name. Amen.
