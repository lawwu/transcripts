[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So what we are going to talk about is inspired by an article
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   that multiple people have sent me recently.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It is an article with an attention-catching title,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   "Why I traded my smartphone for an axe."
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's an article about the extreme lengths someone went to try to cure
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   their damaging smartphone habit.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   So I figured we would take a look at this article
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and using it as a jumping off point to tackle the following deep question,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   "What does it really take to cure your smartphone addiction?"
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So to get started, I'm going to put this article up on my screen here,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   "Why I traded my smartphone for an axe."
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   This article came from Barry Weiss's publication, The Free Press.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   This was written by a teenager named Caleb Silverberg.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Here's the subhead.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   "At 15, Caleb Silverberg made the most important decision of his life.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   He ditched technology and headed to the forest."
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   All right. Well, that sounds intriguing.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Let's look a little bit deeper at this article.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   We'll start by establishing the problem in Caleb's life.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So Caleb says, "During the pandemic, I became a slave to screens.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   My Saturdays were pretty grim.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'd wake up and drag myself to the couch
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   where my Xbox had been waiting for me all night long.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   The closed shades blocked the beaming sun in any hope of enjoying it,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   swimming in the ocean, biking the mountain, hiking with dogs.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   At 15 years old, I looked in the mirror and saw a shell of myself.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   My face was pale. My eyes were hollow.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I needed a radical change."
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   All right. So the article goes on to explain the change that Caleb discovered.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   As he writes, "I vaguely remember one of my older sister's friends
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   describing her unique high school, Midland,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   an experiential boarding school located in the Los Padres National Forest.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It is a place in which cell phone and video games are forbidden."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So Caleb, sensing that he is in a bad way
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   in terms of his relationship with technology,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   decided this is what he needed to do.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   He needed to go to this school, Midland, in the Los Padres National Forest,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   a school in which you're outside and there are no phones and there are no video games.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   He succeeds.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   September 2021, he makes his way to Midland as a student.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Here's some notes on what that experience was like.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   As Caleb writes, "At Midland, students must chop firewood
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   to generate hot water for their showers and heat for their cabins and classrooms.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Armed with an axe, I found myself liberated from the constant allure of technology.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I discovered the joys of engaging in face-to-face conversation
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and savoring moments without the urge to post them on social media."
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Towards his conclusion, he says,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   "I am now going into my junior year at Midland School.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Whenever I am at home, I find myself on my phone much less
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and then only to catch up on my favorite TV shows
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and to talk to the numerous lifelong friends I have made at school.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Midland helped me change how I live my life.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm no longer dependent on a smartphone."
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Well, so this was a sort of inspiring story.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Of course, I figured after reading this
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   that I needed to check out more about this Midland school.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I loaded a couple of photos here up on the screen for those who are watching.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   This looks great to me.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This is talking about aspirational.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   All right, so there's a picture here on the screen
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   that says, "Life at Midland is one big adventure."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And you see farm fields surrounded by mountains.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   All right, we see people hiking.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We see people working on a computer.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   We see people climbing a rock wall.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Let's click here on the link for "Learn More"
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   to see what else we can find out about this school.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I just like looking at these pictures.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   They just make me feel like I'm Thoreau or something like that.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Here's videos on the screen.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Now, there's a dog.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, here's someone taking a saddle.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Here's someone riding a horse.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Here's someone jumping off of a raft,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   collecting eggs from a chicken coop,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   cooking tamales.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I don't know what these people are doing.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Big scenic lake, a swimming hole that they're looking at.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I mean, I get the appeal of this place.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   You see these beautiful scenes of nature
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   where everyone is outside and riding horses,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and you hear about Caleb, the author of that article,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   finally escaping that life as being a hollow shell of himself
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that he was living at his couch's home
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and reengaging in savoring moments in the world.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I think all of that is really aspirational.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I really do like watching those clips.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   But the point I want to make now
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   is I think these stories also have a dangerous side to them.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   The issue with these popular stories
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of extreme measures being deployed
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   to try to get away from issues with technologies
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   is that they paint the picture that that's what's required,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   that the grip that our technology has on us is so strong
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   that short of retreating to the Los Padres National Forest
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   or Chop Wood in a camp in which phones are not allowed,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   you are just stuck looking at your TikTok all day,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   looking at your Instagram Reels all day.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And because most people are not going to follow in Caleb's footsteps
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   and head to the Midland Outdoor Survival Experiential School,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   most people would then conclude,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "I guess this is just the world we live in.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   What can I do about it?"
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And so I think we need to move past these extreme pictures
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   as this is what it takes and get more pragmatic.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I believe that it is quite possible to have a similar effect
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   that Caleb experienced at the Midland School
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   without having to go to the forest.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I think you can have a similar impact,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   a similar result without having to radically change
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   the day-to-day rhythms of your life.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And this is the type of solution we need to look at,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   is those that are pragmatic and accessible to people
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   to do right now in their current situation.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So here's what I'm going to do.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I'm going to walk you through a four-step process
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   for getting a similar experience to Caleb
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   without having to move somewhere else
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and without having to remove phones entirely from your life.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   All right, step number one,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   you need to do a 30-day digital declutter.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   This is a concept and term that I introduced
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   in my 2019 book, "Digital Minimalism."
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It is a concept that I honed after running an experiment
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   with over 1,700 people who went through this experiment with me
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   so I could see what worked and what didn't.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   What do you do in a 30-day digital declutter?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You take a break from optional personal technologies.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You're not on TikTok, you're not on Instagram,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   you're not on Twitter, you're not on Facebook,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   you're not streaming things on your phone.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   You can still do your work email,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   you can still receive text messages from your daughter
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   when they need to be picked up from school.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   But optional personal technologies,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   you step away from for 30 days.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So you're not going to the Los Padres National Forest,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   but you're simulating that break on a much smaller timescale.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   All right, step two, it's not enough to simply walk away
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   from your technology and white-knuckle it
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and hope that you have some sort of detox effect.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I do not believe in this idea that somehow technology overuse
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   is like a toxin in your body,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   that if you can just detoxify yourself, you'll be cured.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   That's not how it works.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You have homework during these 30 days.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You're not just white-knuckling and saying,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   "I'm not going to use Instagram."
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You are going to aggressively try to re-engage
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   with the activities that will replace this technology use.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   That means experimentation and self-reflection.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Experimentation, you need to go out there
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   and join things and do things and go places
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and build things and learn things.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   You need to be very active.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Reconnecting with activities that you suspect
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   might be important to you or activities that you knew
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   at one point in your life were important to you
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   and you've lost track with more recently.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   You also need to be self-reflecting.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   What matters to me? Why? What's important to me?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   How is my life going? What's not going well?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What is my vision of my life going better?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   What am I avoiding recognizing or acknowledging about my life?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   What have I been avoiding with that digital opiate
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   that is coming out of that piece of glass I hold in my hand?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   What am I avoiding about myself that I should confront
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   that I can then once confront and acknowledge and accept,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   start planning what a vision of a life without that would look like?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You've got experimentation, you've got self-reflection.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's what you're doing during your 30 days.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   As I learned in the experiment I ran with 1,700 people,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   if you do not experiment and self-reflect
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   and instead just try to detoxify yourself from technology,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   you won't last 30 days.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Your mind will talk you right back onto TikTok.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It'll talk you right back onto Instagram.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It'll say, "This is not really so bad.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   "Come on, what else are we going to do?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   "The boredom is excruciating and the whole thing will fall apart."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So you have to be active.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   All right, step three, here's the important part.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   What do you do as these 30 days wind down?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Here's where I'm going to suggest a concept taken from finance,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   which is zero-based budgeting.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Now in finance, zero-based budgeting, of course,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   is applied to actual budgets.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's an approach to budgeting for, let's say, an organization
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   where instead of looking at your existing budget and asking,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   "Well, what can I cut or what can we change
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   "or where are we spending too much?"
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   You start from scratch and say,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   "What does our organization need to do?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "What are the key things we do?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   "How much money does that take?"
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And you build up a budget from scratch.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   What are the things that are important?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   How much is it going to cost?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   That's different than taking an existing budget
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and saying, "What can we cut or what can we change?"
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   I'm going to suggest that you apply a zero-based budget
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   to your personal technology use.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You start with nothing.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   You've just spent 30 days free from these technologies,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   so you're starting from nothing, and you say from scratch,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   "What is important to me?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   "What technology do I need to budget to support
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   "these things that are important to me?"
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And in doing so, you're going to build back up
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   a personal portfolio of technology
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   that is tightly coupled to what matters to you.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And more importantly, the technology that was taking up
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   a lot of time and cycles of your attention in your life
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   is likely not going to make it into this budget
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   because when you start with what matters to you
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   and says, "Okay, what technologies do I need
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   "to support this thing that matters to me?"
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   You're unlikely to find the answer to any of those questions
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   being on TikTok for nine hours.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   You're unlikely to find the answer to this question
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   of what's important to me, what technology is going to support me.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You're unlikely to find an answer that says,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   "Mindlessly scroll Instagram for four hours a day."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So when you work forward from values,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   not backwards from what default activities are,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   it's a completely different picture.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And if you're doing zero-based technology budgeting,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   you have this other advantage.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   If you know why you're adding a particular technology
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   back into your life, it is so much easier
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   to add rules around that technology use that makes sense.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   If you know, "I'm adding this technology
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   "to support this particular thing,"
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   then you can talk about what features you don't need.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   You can talk about which devices you can access this technology on,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   how often you need to access this technology.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   When you have a reason for adding a technology,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   you have a foundation on which to build natural fences.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So what I want to do here is give you one, two, three, four, five examples
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   of zero-based technology budgeting in action
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   so you have a better sense of what I'm talking about here.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   All right, here's a classic example I talked about in my book,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "Digital Minimalism."
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I met several different visual artists
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   who went through this process with me,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   30-day declutter, experimentation, self-reflection, zero-based budgeting.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   When they're going through the zero-based budgeting step,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   they said, "Here's the thing.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   "I know I was spending too much time on Instagram,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   "but Instagram serves an important purpose
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "for my vocation as an artist
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   "because there are other artists who post their work in progress on Instagram.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   "By seeing their works in progress, I get creative inspiration.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   "Creativity in the artistic fields require input.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   "You have to see a lot of interesting stuff
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   "to have your own original ideas."
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   So these artists concluded,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   "I need Instagram in my life because I need this inspiration."
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   However, because they knew why they were adding Instagram back into their life,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   they could put natural fences around it.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And what they realized is if the main point of Instagram in their life
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   was just to get inspiration, why was it on their phone,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and why were they looking at it three hours a day?
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   There's not that much original art out there
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   that requires you to look at it three hours a day.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So what they did instead with my prodding is they said,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   "Okay, I'm going to, first of all, curate who I follow on Instagram
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   "down to five to ten artists who I respect.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   "So my feed will be mainly filled with work from these five to ten artists.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   "Two, it takes, what, 30 minutes max per week
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   "to see anything new that these people have published.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   "So what I'll do is I'll put aside a set evening every week
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   "where I load up Instagram."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   They did it on their laptops, not on their phone.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   They took the app off their phone,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   so you just don't have it there as a default.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   One evening a week, turn on the computer
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and scroll through the newest posts from these five to ten artists.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   All of the creative inspiration is there.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You still maximize that benefit, but in this example,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   the footprint of Instagram in their life has now been drastically reduced.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   One of the artists talked about a Friday night ritual,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   glass of wine, put on some music, scroll through these photos,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   so you're in the right mood to receive creative inspiration.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And this became a really positive thing in their life,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   but also it was just taking up 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Whereas before, this was something that was a constant source of distraction.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   All right, let me give you another example.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   You're a writer, and Twitter, you've discovered,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   is a good way to engage with your audience,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   or at least keep your audience, your community of readers
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   sort of engaged in remembering you and engaged with your work
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and maintaining an audience so that you can tell them
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   at some point when you have a new book coming out.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So let's say we recognize this is important.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   This is my best vector for an audience.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   But now that you know this is why it's important,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   how can we put fences around Twitter use in this scenario
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   that supports the value but minimizes the other potentially negative impacts?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, one thing you could do here,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   and I'm borrowing this strategy from a friend of the show, Ryan Holiday,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   who does use Twitter to send out quotes about stoicism.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   He sends out one quote per day.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   How does he do it? Let me give you a hint.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Ryan is not on his phone looking at Twitter all day,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   engaging with people and being in arguments and trying to tweet with them.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   He has a Google Doc somewhere, and they gather these quotes in them.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And he has someone on his team who once a day actually does the posting of the quote.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   He doesn't have to touch Twitter.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   So the writer in our scenario can do the same thing.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Keep the tweets you're going to do in a Google Doc.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Hire someone to post them for you.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   This is not some extravagant thing.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   You can for $50 a week outsource this task to a virtual digital assistant.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It's not going to be some sort of extravagant $50,000 a year to do.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   You pay a minimum amount of money to signal to yourself that I take this seriously,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   but also I don't want to touch this tool.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So again, in this situation, the writer says, "Great.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I'm going to have a constant stream of tweets that I've really thought about.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I'm crafting my Google Doc. I don't touch Twitter."
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   The value is being supported.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   The negative side effects are being minimized.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   All right, example three, keeping up with the news.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I have to be on social media.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   People are talking about the news.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   How often do I learn about some story because it's trending on social media?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Well, if you recognize that being informed is a value,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   you can now say, "Well, what's the best way to use technology to do this?"
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   And you can find answers that don't involve be on Twitter all day and upset.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Subscribe to a Sunday newspaper.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Get a daily or weekly News Digest email from a newspaper.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Listen to a daily or weekly News Digest podcast.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Talk to your friends.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's probably going to be more than enough.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I do that, and I know what's going on in the world.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   This idea that you need to be like a breaking news producer
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   pulling streams from five or six teletype machines
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   as you quickly look at the breaking news from around the world,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   that's not you. You don't need to do that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So again, this example, you identify your value.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I want to be up to speed on the world.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And then you ask the question, "What's the best way to do this?"
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And you realize what you have been doing is not the right answer.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   All right, what about YouTube for information and content?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Maybe YouTube is how you look up how-to advice.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Maybe YouTube, you like creators on YouTube like me.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You like that content better than what's on TV.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So how then, if you recognize this value,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   "I need YouTube to help me figure out how to do home repair.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I need YouTube because I'm tired of watching sitcoms,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   and I'd rather watch Andrew Shuberman's interviews on YouTube
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   than I would watch The Tonight Show on NBC,"
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   if that's a value of yours, how then can you use this technology
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   in a way that's going to support that value without the negative side effects?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Well, we've talked about this in previous episodes of this show before,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   but you can get a plug-in to turn off the up next recommendations.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   If you need how-to information, you're searching just for those videos,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   but there's no rabbit hole to follow.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   And what about, you like Andrew Shuberman, you like me,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   you have certain content you want to watch like a TV show,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   bookmark the page, bookmark the YouTube page.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   And then you can, when it comes time to, "Hey, I want to watch a show while I eat lunch,"
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   have five bookmarks, and you can treat them like channels.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "Let me go to the bookmark for Andrew Shuberman.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Let me go to the bookmark for Cal.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Okay, here's his latest weekly video.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I'm going to put that up on my smart TV."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   So again, it's a way to get the value out of the tool here
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   without having to be, for example, stuck in YouTube rabbit holes for hours every day.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Final example here, keeping up with your friends.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   For a lot of people, this becomes an excuse to constantly be glued
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   and reacting to messaging through their phone,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   taking away their ability to enjoy other things
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   and have gratitude for other things in their life.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   If you recognize that technology helps you keep up with friends
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   better than in a pre-digital technology world,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   you can recognize that value, but then again ask the question,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   "How do I support this value with technology
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   while minimizing the negative side effects?"
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And in this case, what you might do is the following strategy.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   There are certain times during the day
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   where you check text messaging or instant messaging tools
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   to check what's going on with conversations,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   maybe after work, at lunch, again in the evening.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   They're turned off otherwise.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   So you don't have WhatsApp or your iMessage
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   just generally on and available throughout the day.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   There are certain times you turn it on.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And the other times you either have the app closed
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   or you go through the effort of actually adding the filters,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   which you can do on an iPhone or Android to say,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   "Hey, let through important texts for my family,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   but let's mute the big group text threads with my friends, etc. for now."
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   The next thing you do is start to get off your proverbial butt
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and actually with the people that matter to you in your life,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   set up IRL regular activities.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Don't convince yourself that I'm constantly answering
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   group text message threads.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   That means I'm connected to my friends.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Don't give yourself that storyline as an out.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Say, "No, okay, I'm not constantly available on these anymore.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   So what I'm going to do is make sure that, yeah,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   every other week we go to the movies and I call my parents twice a week.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   And for this friend here, we always go for a walk on Mondays."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And you start doing the effort of getting real social interaction
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   with the people that matter to you.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   You put these two things together in this example
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and you're not disconnected.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Still a few times a day, you're able to chime in
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   and have some touches on the digital.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   But you don't mind that you're not constantly in touch
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   because you're also in real life in this particular scenario,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   seeing people and doing things with them.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   You're sacrificing non-trivial time and attention
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   on behalf of your relationships.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   That's what's typically required for your brain
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   to actually treat a relationship as serious.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   That's what's typically required for your brain
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   to think that you actually are being social.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   It doesn't know about text on a cell phone screen.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It doesn't know that socializing.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   So again, if you know it's important to be in touch with my friends
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and the phone can kind of help,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   you can say, "But what's the best way to do this?"
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   So anyways, this is zero-based technology budgeting.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   After your 30-day declutter, you rebuild up
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   your personal technological portfolio from scratch.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   What are the things that really matter?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   What technology do I have to budget towards the things that matter?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   What rules or fences do I put around those technology use?
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   This will almost certainly radically change your relationship with technology
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   without requiring you to retreat to a forest
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and chop wood all day
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   and have counselors take your phone and video games away
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and you have to go years and completely rewire your mind.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   This is something you can do right now.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You could start it today
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   and 60 days from now,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   have a completely different relationship with your tools.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   It has nothing to do with removing tools from your life forever.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   There's nothing to do with demonizing tools
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   and saying digital tech has to go.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   It's instead saying, "I care about the things that matter to me.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Hey, tools, you're going to help me pursuing what matters.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   You no longer are in charge.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I'll figure out what matters.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Where you can be helpful, I'll let you in my life.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   And where you can't, go away.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I don't care. I don't need to hear about it."
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You can do your TikTok dance ice bucket,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Instagram real trends on your own time.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I don't care about that anymore.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   I'm getting after the stuff that matters to me.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I'm using tools when it helps me,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and otherwise you can get out of my way.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   No acts required.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   So there you go, Jesse.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Zero-based budgeting.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   - I like it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   - I'm a nerd for the technical terms.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   All right, so we're going to have some questions coming up
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   that more or less are going to all orbit around
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   the same general topic of reforming your relationship
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   with technology in your life.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   First, however, I want to mention one of the sponsors
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   that makes this show possible.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That's our longtime friends at Blinkist.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   The Blinkist app enables you to understand
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   the most important ideas from over 5,500 nonfiction books
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   and podcasts in just 15 minutes.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   With the Blinkist app, you can read or listen to
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   blinks of these books and podcasts.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   These blinks give you a 15-minute summary
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   of all of the key points.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   The way I use this app and the way that Jesse uses this app
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   as well is as a triage tool for the reading component
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   of our lives.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   If a book seems interesting, we'll add it to a list.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   When it comes time to buy a new book,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   we will listen to or read the blinks
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   for the books we're thinking about buying
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and use that information to decide if it's worth
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   buying or not.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   What you'll find is 50% of the time,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   you listen to or read the blink and you conclude,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   "This book's not what I thought," or, "It is what I thought,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   "but I think this 15-minute summary, I get it."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   50% of the time, by contrast, you listen to the summary
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   and say, "My God, I've got to buy this book.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "These points seem fascinating.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   "I want to learn more about it."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   It's a perfect sidekick.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Think about it as a digital sidekick
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   for the reading life.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   That's how I use it. That's how Jesse uses it.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Jesse likes to read the blinks.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I like to listen to the blinks, but we get to the same place.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   just for our audience.

[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   it's a special offer, Blinkist Connect,

[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   for the price of one
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   with this special Blinkist Connect offer.

[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I just wanna talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   You need to be using a VPN.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   This is Cal, the computer scientist talking to you now.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You need to be using a VPN, and here is why.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   When you access the internet,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   other people can see what sites and services you're accessing.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   If you're in a public place using Wi-Fi,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   anyone with an antenna can see the packets
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   you're sending wirelessly to the access point
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   and what destination those packets are going to,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   what website or service you're talking to.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   If you're at home,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   through your private internet connection
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   in the privacy of your own home,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   your internet service provider can look at
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   what websites or services are you talking to,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   they can collect that information,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and they can sell that information, which they do.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   So people are watching what you do,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   what sites you talk to, what services you use.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   A VPN prevents them from doing that.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   The technical idea is very simple.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   If you use a VPN,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   instead of connecting directly to a site or service,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   you instead connect to a VPN server.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   You then tell the VPN using encrypted messages
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   that no one can read,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   here is the site or service I really want to talk to.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   The VPN server then talks to that site or service
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   on your behalf, encrypts and hides the answer,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   and sends it back to you.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   So anyone who's listening to your communication,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   your internet service provider,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   the creepy guy next to you in Starbucks,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   who for some reason is holding a six foot tall RF antenna
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   with giant headphones on,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   trying to act nonchalant, just sitting here holding it.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   They can't see who you're talking to.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   All right, so you need a VPN.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   The right VPN to use is ExpressVPN,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   it's the one I use.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   They have servers all over the world.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So wherever you are,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   there's probably a server that's nearby geographically
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   to connect to, which is key for speed.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   They also have a lot of bandwidth.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   So again, speed, speed, speed.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And finally, their software is intuitive.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   You just turn it on with a click
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   and then you use your web browsers or apps like normal.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   It's completely hidden in the background
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   that there's actually a VPN protecting you.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   So secure your online activity

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   - Jesse, I always think about when doing the ExpressVPN ad,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   the Gene Hackman character from "The Conversation."
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I don't know if you know "The Conversation."
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   It's a great Francis Ford Coppola movie.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   But Hackman's character is a surveillance expert
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and he wears this weird cheap plastic raincoat.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   This is a movie from the seventies
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   and he has all these electronic gadgets he uses
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   for, you know, with big antennas.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And he has a whole laboratory
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   full of bugging equipment and microphones.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And as I always imagine Gene Hackman from "The Conversation"
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   sitting across from you in a Starbucks
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   with his headphones and the antenna.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And there's like a rotate,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   his hat has a satellite dish that's rotating around.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   - That's so good.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   - And that's what's out there, ExpressVPN.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   All right, enough of that nonsense.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Let's do some questions from you, our listeners.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   These questions should all roughly have to do
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   with technology,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   reforming your relationship with technology.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   All right, Jesse, who is our first question
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   asker, interlocutor?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   - First question is from Wes.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Wes says, "Like Cal, I don't use social media
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and I have a computer science degree.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I too am ignorant of what is occurring in the world."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   - Not ignorant.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   - Not ignorant of what is occurring in the world
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and have social connections without using social media.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   However, I still wish to share my work online
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   and build an audience for similar reasons as Cal.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   With the world being so engrossed in social media,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I'm unsure how to go about this
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   while maintaining my privacy as Cal does.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I would like to hear Cal's advice
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   on how he manages a YouTube channel,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   podcasts, online writing, et cetera,
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   and how he's comfortable with sharing information
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   like his face and his name while still remaining private.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   - Well, Wes, I think I understand the question.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I think you're making a mistake.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   There's an inversion in your thinking here
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   that is very common right now
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   in people who are thinking about trying to
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   make a move towards being some sort of,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I don't wanna say writer anymore, content producer.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Let's use that phrase.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And here's the inversion or mistake
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   that I think you're making
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and a lot of other people are making too.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   They start by thinking about the channels.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   What are the channels?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   How do I optimize the channels?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   What's the right way to use Twitter?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   What's the right way to use YouTube?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   What's the right way to build a paid email newsletter?
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   What are the best practices?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   How do I get the sort of maximum conversion
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   from non-paid to paid subscribers?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   They start there and then say,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   I'll figure out like what I'm gonna say.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   That's backwards.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Where you need to start is figuring out
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   what do I have to say that people care about?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   How do I actually find something
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   that I'm the right person to talk about
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   that there's a non-trivial group of people out there
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   who are gonna be very engaged in what I have to say?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   This is the hard part.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   It is very difficult to figure out a message
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   that you're the right person to say,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   you can say it well,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   and the way you're saying it's gonna appeal
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   to a lot of people.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   That is very hard to find.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That's where all of your efforts should be
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   if you wanna do something like I do,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   even as a productive side hustle,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   nevertheless, as a living.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   That's all the hard work.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Once that's clicking,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   you can care a little bit more about,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   okay, well, how am I reaching people?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And then you can care a little bit more about,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   okay, maybe I wanna optimize
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   how I'm using these various channels.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   But none of that is important
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   until you get the first thing first solved,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   which is having something to say
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that people care about,
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   and that's where your energy should go.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So why do people invert this?
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Because the internet marketing channel
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   optimization stuff is fun.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It seems so tractable.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   I have a term for this, by the way.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   This is a term that I think came out
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   of online productivity circles
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   from the late '90s, early 2000s.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   I call it checklist productivity.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   We saw a lot of this
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   from sort of the West Coast productivity personalities
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   in the early 2000s.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   We are really attracted to systems
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   or schemes that are checklist-based.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   If you do these 10 things,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   each of which is tractable by itself,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   a really big result will happen,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   a really positive thing will happen.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Checklist productivity is really appealing
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   because you can tell yourself a story.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   I'm gonna succeed here
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   because other people don't have this information.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   They just don't know
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   that these are the 10 things that you do.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   But if I do these 10 things,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   I'm gonna get this big reward.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And you convince yourself
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   that you found this information
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   and how motivating is it?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Like, I know I can do each of these 10 things.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   They're all tractable, but they're a little hard.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   I set up this account.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I start doing this.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   I optimize this.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I have a tweet schedule.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Everything is tractable.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   And this storyline, if I just do these things,
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   it's like moderate amounts of hard work
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   on a regular basis,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I'm gonna be a major online personality.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   It's incredibly appealing, and it doesn't work.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Everything is driven
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   by having something to say that people care about.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   And that is the hardest thing in the world.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   That is the hardest thing in the world.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I think a good analogy here to think about
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   is old-fashioned television.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Every TV network by 1965
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   knew how to make a television show
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   and how do you hire writers
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   and how do you film it right?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   And what is the three-act structure of a sitcom?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   And how do you break up a show?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   And how do you market a show?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And what's the right way to do advertising?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   All of that was known,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   and yet most shows don't succeed.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   What was the most important thing?
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Finding a show that people wanted to actually watch.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And so that's where all the energy was.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   The showrunners, the writers, the personalities,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   when everything just clicked just right,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   was worth billions.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   This is like Seinfeld.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And when it didn't click just right,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   you'd lose money on it.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Everyone knew how to build a show,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   but what mattered was,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   could you build a show that people wanted to watch?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   That is the right analogy
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   for thinking about being a content producer
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   in the digital age.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Forget about the checklist
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   about how to optimize your YouTube channel.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Care about having something to say
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   that people really care about.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   If you succeed in this,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and you see some traction,
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   then you can start caring about,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   "Well, what channels am I using?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   "Maybe I should change that.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   "What channels am I using?
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   "Maybe I should improve how I use it."
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   But don't let that come before
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   the actual hard work of figuring out something to do.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   So how do you actually do this then?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   It's like, choose a couple,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   a couple reasonable channels to get started with,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and try to get success in those.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And let that be what you do.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And once you have success relative to those,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   that's when you can care about it.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   So in my own career,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   I started with books,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   followed soon after by blogging newsletters.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   So I want to publish books that succeed,
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   and I put my energy into that.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And then I started blogging about those books.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And that was basically just where my energy was
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   for a long time.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   And once I really felt like,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   "Okay, this is clicking.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   "I have something to say.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "I have an audience.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   "I'm looking at the technology world.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   "I've been doing it for a decade."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I said, "Okay, now I'm gonna go into podcasting.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   "Now I'll think about that.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   "I'm gonna go into podcasting,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   "because I have all these things to say
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   "that are clicking, and I've sold millions of books,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "and I have a big audience now.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   "Podcasting, I've really thought about it."
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   And I was very late to this,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   'cause I'm very deliberate.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Like, "Okay, I'm gonna go into podcasting now,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   "'cause I think that's a way to interact
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   "with this segment in a more meaningful way,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "and it's a new technology that wasn't there before."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   And then once we got into podcasting,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I slowly then started caring about
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   how do you do this right?
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And now that we're a few years into it,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   we have it down to a better science.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I think Jesse would agree.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I have Jesse on board.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   We've got our sound guy.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   We've got our ad agency.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   We've got our studio.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   That all came slowly after I had something to say.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   More recently, we've decided that video is very important.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   The podcast could be an engine
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   for reaching a different audience via YouTube.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   And we did that for about a year just to get used to it.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And now we actually have a professional on board,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and we're figuring out how to do that right.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   That all came after.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   The podcast had traction.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Okay, this content is working.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Now let's think if there's another related channel
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   that's gonna reach an audience
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   who would like to hear this is not hearing it now.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   So again, this channel optimization stuff
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   comes after content works.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So Wes, don't get the cart before the course here.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Focus on having something to say that people wanna hear.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Focus on getting tangible, unambiguous evidence
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   that people like what you have to say.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And I don't care what channel you do this on,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   whether it's a book or a sub stack or Instagram,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   just choose one, don't worry about it.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And only then do I want you to really care about optimizing,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   getting on your tech hat, starting to tweak the features,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   all the fun checklist productivity stuff.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Wait until you have no choice but to get involved in that.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I think that's the right way to do it.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I mean, Jesse, you probably see this too.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Like the internet is full of, you can just tell
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   it's people who got some checklist somewhere.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   - Yeah. - You know?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   - Yeah.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   - I see this on Twitter a lot now,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   where there'll be like a link or someone,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I'll come across it because they're mentioning
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   something we did.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And you'll go to the Twitter page,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   because I don't have like a Twitter app or anything.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   So if I'm using, looking at something on Twitter,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I'm just in a web browser and I'm just like bookmark,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   you know, like a baseball reporter's page.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   So I'll go like in the browser to their Twitter homepage,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I don't know what you call it.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   - Yeah. - It'll be 60 subscribers.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And they'll have this like weird sequence of content.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And you're like, oh, they just like did a course
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   about this or something.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And it's all like, they've optimized this whole thing
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   about, and it's like, here's my thread.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   And then at the bottom of the thread, it says,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   well, if you like this, you know,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   you'll also like these other things and please subscribe.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And it's like, they're all doing the same course,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   but none of them have a particular selling proposition.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Like, well, who are you?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   What's your point of view?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   And why are you the right person to talk about it?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   - It's like, they just heard this course of like,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   if you do threads on productivity books or something
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   that you'll be Ali Abdaal or something like that.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   You know, it's like, that's really hard to do.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Like, anyways, it's a bone I have to pick.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   It's like, we don't put enough energy
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   into the hard part first, which is having something to say.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   - Yep. - It's a lot more fun.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   - And the same message you give to aspiring authors
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   about like writing a book.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   - Yeah. - Being the right person
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   to talk about the right subject.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   - Yeah, that's always my thing about book writing.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   You have to have a topic that people are gonna feel
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   like they have to buy.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   You have to be able to write
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and you have to be the right person to write that book.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And most people get one or two out of the three,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   but not all three.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And that's why they fail to sell a book.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   So it's either like a cool topic,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   but it's like, who are you to write about it?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Or it's a, you're the right person to write about it,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   but who cares?
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Or you're the right person to talk about it.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   It's a cool idea,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   but you're not a good enough writer to really pull it off.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So you gotta have all three.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   What do we got next?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   - Next question is from Concerned Parent.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   What are your thoughts on using an iPad
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   as a standard part of the K through 12 education system?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Is it effective in teaching children
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   or are we introducing more sources of digital distractions?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   - Well, I think there's a big debate that is going on
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and is worthwhile surrounding the utility of ed tech.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   In one of my books,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   and I don't remember if this was digital minimalism
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   or deep work.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I think it was in my book, "Digital Minimalism."
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I have this footnote that's become sort of infamous
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   or I weighed tentatively into the ed tech debate
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and say this idea that we need kids
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   to be very comfortable with computer interfaces like iPads
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   because the economy is high tech
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   and it's gonna help them be programmers
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   in the future or something.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It's like giving kids Hot Wheels
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   because we want them to be good
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   at becoming automobile mechanics.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   The separation between consumer facing digital interfaces
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   that are optimized and easy
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and the complicated skill developing technology
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   is so big that they're basically disconnected
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and I didn't buy that argument.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   So I've been involved in the ed tech arguments
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   but when it comes to this particular issue
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and I hear this a lot from parents,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   the kids using technology in school
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   is making them reinforcing unhealthy technology habits
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   in their lives.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I don't buy that argument.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   I think they're orthogonal.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   I think the issue of young kid technology abuse
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   is orthogonal to in the classroom ed tech.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Whether or not your kid is doing reflex max math
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   on a Chromebook or they're playing YouTube videos
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   on the Prometheus board in their class,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   whether or not they're doing that
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   will not determine whether or not your kid
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   has a healthy or unhealthy relationship with technology.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   The technology in the classroom
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   is relatively well constrained.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   You're doing specific things on it.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   We can argue about whether it's important or not.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   We can argue about whether these tech companies
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   are basically just laundering tax dollars
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   from people's property taxes
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   into their corporate coffers
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   by trying to convince schools you have to buy all this tech.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We can argue about all that
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   but the Chromebooks and the iPads
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   and the YouTube and the Prometheus boards
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   is not what's making your kid addicted to technology.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   It's what's happening at home.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   That's what's happening at home.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   What technology do you allow them to use
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   and how do you personally model technology
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   use in your own life?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Those are the two things that matter.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   If you let your kid just have an iPad or a smartphone
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   and have unrestricted access to the internet
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   or hours and hours playing online games,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   they're on Roblox, they're on Minecraft servers,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   that's the thing that's going to make
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   by far the biggest difference
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   in what their relationship with technology is.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   If your 12-year-old is on text messaging
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   with her friends and on Snapchat,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   that's because you let her do that.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   That's going to be the problem,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   not whether or not they had a Chromebook in school,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   not whether or not a teacher played a YouTube video
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   on the Prometheus board because they were tired.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Ed tech is orthogonal from kid technology abuse.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   That's my current thoughts on it.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And why I'm emphasizing this is that I think
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   it's easier sometimes for parents
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   to have fingers to point outward
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   than to have to grapple with,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "Man, it's going to be really hard
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   "if we set a technology policy for our household
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   "that we think is healthy, it's going to be really hard.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   "There's going to be a lot of social pressure.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   "My kid's going to yell at me every day
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "and they're going to say, 'All my friends are doing it,'
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   "and we're going to be really stressed out about it."
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   And I'd rather just say,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   "We're not happy with our kid's technology setup,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   "but there's all these reasons why that's not our fault."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   If they have iPads in school,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   what are you going to do these days?
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I think it's an excuse.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   There is, however, I think, a tentative connection
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   between ed tech and kid technology overuse
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   that you do need to be wary about,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   and that is this very clever excuse
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   that middle schoolers in particular have started using,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   where they say, "I have to have unrestricted access
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   "to the internet through a smartphone or iPad
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   "because I have to go on the internet to do my homework."
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   And a lot of parents fall for this.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   The fact that, you know, there's some part
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   of their math homework is in a Google Classroom somewhere,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   or like once a year their social studies teacher says,
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "Look up some information online."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   The fact that they convince you
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   that that means they need an iPhone.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Oldest trick in the book,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   and by oldest I mean it's like five years old.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   But I hear a lot about it,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   and what I think is going on here,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   it's not that the parents are dumb,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   it's just it's too hard to actually do
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   what all of the evidence points at,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   which is what would be healthy here,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   which is, and people don't like to hear this,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   but is unrestricted internet access
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   through smartphone and iPad should be 16 or older.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   That's so hard socially and parenthally
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   that we're desperate for some excuse
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   to not have to do that.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   So we will fall for this.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Oh yeah, they got to do their homeworks online.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   They have to phone all their works online.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   They use Chromebooks at school.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   They have to have a phone.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   It's a completely, I think, fallacious connection.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   It's a logical fallacy.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   It's a broken syllogism.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   And I think we all know that, but it's an excuse.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   So that is the tentative connection,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   is that I think a lot of middle schoolers
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   have figured out I can use the fact
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   that some school stuff happens online
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   to justify using six hours of TikTok a day.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   So anyways, there we go.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I would say care about ed tech,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   but don't connect it in your mind
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   as being critical to the other really big issue,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   which is what is my kid's relationship
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   with technology writ large?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   That comes down to the parents.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   It's really tough, but I don't think
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   we have any excuse about the grapple
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   with that head on.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   We'll see.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   I'm giving a couple of talks at my kid's school
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   coming up on this topic again.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Yeah, so we'll see.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   We'll see how that goes.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   They have to have the internet.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   - They posted on Google Classroom.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   They posted what the schedule's gonna be for next week.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   So I have to use 19 hours of Roblox tonight.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   - Parents are like, yeah, checks out.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   You know why it checks out?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Because Google Classroom involves the internet
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   and Roblox is on the internet.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   I mean, you know, A follows B, B follows C.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Give them an iPhone.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   You know, your son's been playing Fortnite
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   without stopping to go to the bathroom for 45 hours.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Are you worried about that?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Oh, no, no, they use Prometheus boards
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   in their classroom.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   That's technology.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So it's like, you know, they gotta,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   the kids have to use technology.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I mean, what can I, there's a,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   they have a Chromebook in the school.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   What can I do?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   What can I do?
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   I can't stop them.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   - You hear it.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   You know who talks of,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   it's always like semi-depresses me.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I don't know if you've heard this, Jesse.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   You might've mentioned,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   you might've noticed this, that Bill Simmons,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   when Bill Simmons talks about his kids,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   the podcast of Bill Simmons,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   he'll always say things like,
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   oh, I can judge by,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I can judge how much they like a movie
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   by like how many minutes they put down TikTok
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   to watch, to actually look up
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   when we were like watching a movie together.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Like, so you're just like fully conceding
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   that like my kids are just on TikTok all the time
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   and I'm lucky if they maybe look up
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   every once in a while.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   It's crazy.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Technology is weird.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   I think it's because we all use it.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It's so weird.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I mean, you would never hear someone
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   in that situation be like,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   oh, I can tell my kid really likes a book
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   because like they put down the 40 of malt liquor
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   they've been slamming all day
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   to like actually read it.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   The other question is like,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   why are you letting them slam malt liquor all day?
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   You know?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   It's like, what are you going to do
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   to the kids these days?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   You know, it's crazy.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   It's like, yeah.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   I mean, when he stops,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   when he stops smoking for 10 minutes,
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   I'm like, wow, he must really be engaged
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   in what's going on.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I mean, of course he can't stop the kid
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   from smoking all day.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   Of course he was.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   This whole thing of like, what can you do?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   The kids saw a laptop at one point.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I had to give them an iPhone.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   I digress.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I digress.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   All right.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   What do we got next, Jesse?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   By the way, angry letters from that
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   from parents should go to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   That's where all your angry letters should go.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   I always get angry letters for this
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   because parenting is impossible
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   and it's more complicated than I say.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   But I feel like I'm a parent.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   So I'm a label to like rag on other parents
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   and we all just get mad at each other.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   All right, let's move on.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   - All right, next question's from Austin.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Hey, I've been going deep on Cal's work
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   after reading deep work last year.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I'm currently implementing changes and processes
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   from digital minimalism and a world without an email
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and feel great.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   My question centers around sites like Goodreads,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Letterboxd, or Last.fm.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   That collect data and help track media consumption
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   while having a social dynamic.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   I love these sites as I find it useful
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   to track books and movies.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   I may be interested in, but also because I'm a little obsessed
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   with data and stats and that part of my life.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   I worry that I'm tying my interests like going deep on
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   like reading, film, watching, and music
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   too closely to technology in a way that feels inorganic
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   at times.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Is this a problem?
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   - I recognize some of these sites.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Goodreads, I know.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Letterboxd, I know.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   That's like movie fans.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Do you know Last.fm?
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   - No, I don't.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   - I don't know what that is.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I'm gonna load that up over here, actually.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Let's see here.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   All right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Let's see, Last.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   I'm just curious.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   I just wanna make sure we're talking about
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   the same things here.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   All right, I'm loading up Last.fm on my screen here.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   So for those who are watching the deeplife.com/listen
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   episode 266, Last.fm, explore top music
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   powered by your Scrabbles.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Oh, dear Lord.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   All right, so I don't know what Scrabble is,
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   but Last.fm looks to be like a music,
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   social music site.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Olivia Rodrigo, spiking tracks, all-time Scrabbles.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   I really hope that term doesn't catch on.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Scrabbles.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   A live global counter showing the total number
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   of tracks listened to in users since 2003.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   That's a big number.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Okay.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   I don't mind.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   Here's my general take on it, Austin.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Like, as I've written about in the pages
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   of my New Yorker writing,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   I've talked about this a few times.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   I like, in general, indie internet.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   I like, in general, sort of indie social.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Smaller sites, smaller communities,
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   sites that aren't trying to aggregate everybody
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   onto the same platform.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   This was my most recent New Yorker piece
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   where I talked about threads and Twitter,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   and it was called, "Does the world need a new Twitter?"
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And the argument of that New Yorker piece
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   was the very notion that it's important
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   that we have a global conversation platform
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   where everyone's on the same platform.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   That notion is flawed.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   That's never going to work well.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   Of course we're going to end up
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   with a Lord of the Flies scenario,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   and it doesn't actually increase or solve
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   any problems that anyone actually has.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   It's much better to have many more
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   narrow niche bespoke places
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   for people to gather to talk about particular interests.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   So in general, the idea of Blast.fm
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   or Goodreads or Letterboxd, I'm okay with.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Now I know those aren't truly indie social media.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   Goodreads is owned by Amazon.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   I mean, these have become relatively large services.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   But in general, I don't mind online communities
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   that bring people together around particular interests,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   so long as you think that the benefits outweigh the harms.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   So Austin, when you do your zero-based technology budgeting,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   and if music is very important in your life,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   start from scratch.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   How do I want to invest,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   make technology investments in this thing I care about?
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   And just reflect on your last .fm use in this case.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   And if it's given you a lot of benefits,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   find a way to put it in there with some neat fences.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   And if not, maybe like, actually, you know what?
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   What I really like is this,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   maybe this Pitchfork newsletter
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   that turns me on to new music,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   and this podcast I listen to,
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   and I use Spotify to be able to sample a lot of songs
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   and see if I like them,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   and that's the right technology portfolio.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   Then do that.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Just be honest about,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   here's what I care about,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   what is a good package of technology to support this?
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   And then just be happy with your answer there.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Don't worry about what you're missing out.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Same thing with Letterboxd.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   If it's really helping you discover and appreciate movies,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   then go with it.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   If it's not,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   maybe you just subscribe to a couple movie podcasts.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   Same thing with Goodreads.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   If it's helping you discover new books in a useful way,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   go with it.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   If it's not,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   you find yourself just obsessing about your stats
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and not getting much value,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   then don't go with it.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   So in general,
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   I think it's an important time for me to do some clarification.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   I like the internet.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   I like the internet as a way of bringing together people
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   who might not otherwise be able to find each other
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   to gather around common interest or identity.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   I think that is a miraculous development that the internet gave us,
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   and the right scale for that to exist is on small.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Gathering to talk about movies is great.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Gathering to talk about,
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   so if we have a thousand people gathering to talk about movies,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   that's great.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   A billion people gathering to talk about everything
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   on the same Twitter platform,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   that causes trouble.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   So just be honest about your use there, Austin,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   but I'm not going to be mad at you for using those.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   If it's giving you value,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   I think it's a good use of the internet.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   - All right, next question's from Adam.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   "I'm 30 years old,
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   "and I feel like I should have my life together by now.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   "I don't like my career,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   "I'm not healthy,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   "and I'm constantly stressed about money.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   "Do you have any advice or simple actions I can implement
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   "in my life on a daily basis to make progress
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   "and head in a positive direction?"
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   - Well, so the reason why I included this question
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   in today's episode,
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   which is really about our relationship with technology,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   is that I'm making the guess
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   that the first obstacle to clear
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   on the path away from the shallows
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   in which Adam is mired and towards a deeper life,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   the first obstacle to clear away here
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   is probably a harmful relationship with technology.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   So for people of this age,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   you're in your 20s,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   you're in your 30s,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   and you feel stuck,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   often one of the things that is keeping you stuck
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   is these tools,
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   is what's coming in over your phone
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   and what's coming in over your smart TV.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   The reason why it keeps it stuck
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   is because these tools are optimized
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   to scratch the itches that are core to our humanity.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   We wanna connect to other people.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   We wanna have efficacy.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   We wanna do things that are recognized.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   We wanna have standing in our community.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   We wanna be inspired by beauty and on craftsmanship.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   All of these are deep human instincts
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   that are wired to push our lives
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   in more productive, deeper directions.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   But there's apps on your phone and on your tablet
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   and on your smart TV
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   that can satisfy those urges just enough
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   to keep you satisfied.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Okay, I guess I'm okay.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   To keep you stuck in your status quo.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   You're texting and on social media enough
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   that you feel like,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   "I'm not literally alone, I'm talking to people."
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   So you consider that it's scratched.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   You're making progress in a video game
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   and that's just enough of scratching that itch
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   of, "I wanna make something of myself
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   "and be recognized by my community,"
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   that you're not forced to get up and do something.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   You're yelling at people on Twitter.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   You have a tribe on there.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   You know, we're yelling at the Libs
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   or we're yelling at the MAGA crowd
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and that kind of scratches barely this itch
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   of like, "I wanna be involved
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   "in something bigger than me that matters."
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   The itches are scratched just enough
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   that you stay on the couch
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   and you stay stressed
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   and you stay like your life isn't put together
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   and like nothing is happening.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   This is the danger of these tools
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   is that they prevent us.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   They prevent us from getting fed up enough
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   to actually make changes.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   So this is why I wanna say,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   "Let's start.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   "Let's start with re-evaluating
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   "your relationship with technology."
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   And this is where I want you to do something
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   like we've been talking about,
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   like zero-based technology budgeting.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Get all this stuff out of your life.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Take a 30-day break
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   from all of these optional tools.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   No video games, no social media,
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   no YouTube, no streaming.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Spend those 30 days
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   aggressively self-reflecting
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   and experimenting with analog activities
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   that are meaningful to you.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Figure out what's going on with your life.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   Face and confront.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   This is Nietzsche looking into the abyss.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   What you're not happy about in your life.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Why?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   And then move past this to self-author
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   what you want your life to look like in five years
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   so you have clarity about what you dislike now.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   You have clarity about what you would love
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   in your life going forward.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   You have clarity through your experimentation
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   of what really is important or meaningful to you,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   what you really enjoy and what you don't.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   And then rebuild your technological life from scratch.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Everything has to earn its way in
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   for a particular purpose.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   I care about this.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   What's the right way to use technology to do this?
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   I care about that.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   What's the right way to use technology to do that?
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   When you do the zero-based budgeting,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   most of this stuff that's gunking up your life, Adam,
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   that's keeping you quiescent,
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   that's keeping you just satisfied enough
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   that you don't get off the couch,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   is going to be gone.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   If you recognize, "Hey, I'm 30.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   "I'm 30 and a man and I want to stand up
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   "and be a useful member of society
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   "and respected by my community."
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   When you know that's really valuable to you
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   and you know that there's some self-recrimination
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   about you not doing that,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   and you're trying to build up from scratch,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   "Well, what technology can help me do that?"
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   You're not going to answer if you're being honest,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   "Well, I just want to make it to the next level
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   "in World of Warcraft or whatever."
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   No, you're saying, "No, no, okay.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   "I need to actually do something here
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   "that's going to be meaningful.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   "And where can technology help me?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   "Maybe it can help me find a group
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   "and connect to a group where I can then go in real life
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   "and join that group and make progress."
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   So it's going to completely reinvent your relationship
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   with technology.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   So instead of it keeping you pacified,
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   it instead becomes a tool you deploy
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   in the construction of a deeper life.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   All right, so once you've done that,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   once you've cleared out the technological pacification,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   now we can work our way
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   through what I call the deep life stack.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   You can work your way through the layers
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   of the deep life stack on your way towards a deeper life.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   We talk about this a lot, so I'll move quickly,
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   but you would start then with habits and discipline.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   So pick a couple areas of your life
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   you've identified as being important
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and have a daily discipline that you follow,
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   a habit you follow every day.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   It should be tractable but non-trivial.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   This is all about just telling yourself the story
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   of I can do things that are important
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   even if I don't have to.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   I can make progress on parts of my life I care about
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   because I think it's important in the long term
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   even though I don't want to do it in the short term.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   As part of that discipline stack,
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   also start tracking in a central place.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Here's the systems and habits and disciplines I follow.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   That thing is going to grow.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   That document will grow
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   as you make your way through the stack.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Then you move up to the values layer of the stack.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   Now you really clarify and codify what you learned
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   during your technology zero-based budgeting exercise.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   What am I all about?
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   You need to have a code.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   This is what I'm about.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   And this code is not just here's things I care about.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   It has to be a psychological/philosophical game plan,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   not just for how do I excel,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   but how do I make it through the hard parts?
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   What's important to me
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   and what's going to pull me forward
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   through the parts that are really hard,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   especially early on when I feel like nothing's going right.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   And the code should tell you,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   what am I going to do when things are going really well
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   and how am I going to live up to that?
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   You want to have your first draft of this code.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   If you're from a religious background,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   you're going to find a lot of useful work there.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   If you're not,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   you can find a lot of good useful work in philosophy.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   But you want to be really clear
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   about what you're writing down here
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   and don't worry about getting it right.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   That can evolve.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Then you move your way up to the control layer of the stack.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   It is now and only now, Adam,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   that you start to get organized,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   get the messy parts of your life together,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   get your finances in order,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   get your fitness in order,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   get your productivity systems running
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   so you're not just all over the place,
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   get your act together and work,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   build up that career capital
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   so people start seeing you, Adam,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   as this guy gets it done.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   And he does it when he says he's going to do it
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   and he does it at a high level.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   And why do you do that?
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Because that's going to give you leverage
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   to start shaping your career towards what matters to you.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   But remember, we're not getting our act together.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   We're four steps in here.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   We've already started clearing out
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   the technological pacification.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   We've done discipline.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   We've done values.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   And only now do we have the foundation
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   we need to actually power through
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   the difficulty of organizing our lives.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   And then you get to the final layer of the deep life stack
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   is where you're going to have vision
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   and you begin planning
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   to make your life more remarkable.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   And the first time you go through this,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   you'll choose one area of your life
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   and say, "How am I going to make that area of my life
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   more remarkable?"
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   And maybe it's a professional thing
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   or maybe it's a fitness thing.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   I'm going to become incredible shape
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   and become a, I don't know, Cameron Haynes style
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   deep back country bow elk hunter
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   that's going to require me to train marathons daily
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   or whatever it is.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   Maybe it's an intellectual pursuit.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   You're going to take one part of your life
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   and make it remarkable.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   And this is going to take you about a year
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   and you're going to be so much better at this point, Adam.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   And then you just keep revisiting this.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Hey, as technology creep back into my life
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   in an unhealthy way,
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   let me re-clarify in zero-based budget,
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   work your way up the stack.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Do that once a year.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   Adam, you're like a year away from your life
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   being a lot better.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   You're five years away from your life
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   being something that people remark about.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   I have complete faith in that.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   But this is the new thing I'm adding now
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   because I've realized this listening to you, my listeners.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   You have to think about the technology use
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   like the same way you would think about
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   perhaps an alcohol or drug problem
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   if you were pursuing a deep life.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   Until you solve that,
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   you're going to have a lot of trouble
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   with all the other things.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   So you want to start with getting that technology monkey
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   off your back and then we can work our way
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   through the deep life stack.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   All right.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   I think we have time for one more question, Jesse.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   - Yeah.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   We got one more question from Julie.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   How can I stay on top of current events
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   while still living deep?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   It's so easy to get sucked into social media scrolling,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   but what about the news?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   - Well, Julie, I'm assuming
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   you're not a network television news director.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   You're not someone who is sitting backstage
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   at the NBC nightly news
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   panning cameras and telling producers
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   to go after stories.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   You're not a news director.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   So you can chill out about the news.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   You don't need to know everything that's going on.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   You're not even really learning everything
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   that's going on in social media.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   You're getting a bunch of takes
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   on things that are going on.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   So my first thing I'm going to say
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   is just chill out about feeling like
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   you have to be up on everything.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   You're not a news director.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   So what should you do instead?
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   Just have a much more minimalist
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   news consumption ritual.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Take a weekly newspaper or even easier,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   go to Starbucks on Sunday.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   They sell the newspapers there,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   buy the Sunday paper, read it for an hour.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   That alone, you will be just as informed
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   as you are now with a lot less stress.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   If you don't want to do that,
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   there are news digest emails
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   that you can get from newspapers
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   with a digital subscription.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   There's news roundup podcasts
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   that are both daily and weekly.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   Listen to some of those.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   Put on NPR when you commute to work
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   and listen to Morning Edition.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   There's a major story going on.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   There's an earthquake somewhere.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   Something's on fire.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   They'll tell you about it.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   And that's enough.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   And you know enough.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Now, I know this might sound radical,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   but let me tell you, if we go back,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   what's this, if we go back about 10 years,
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   let me tell you who did adopt this approach
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   to news consumption.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Everybody, everywhere.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   Because it was the only way to do it.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   There wasn't social media.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   And you know what? People were fine.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   This idea that in 2009,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   people just stumbled around blindly,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   like, I don't know what's going on.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   Like, who's the president? Really?
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   That guy? All right. I mean, okay.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   What's going on? Yeah.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   There's who died? Okay.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   Hey, I didn't know.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   There was no place I could go
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   where strangers were yelling at each other
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   about the news.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   So how would I possibly know
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   what was going on in the world?
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Somehow people knew what was going on
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   in the world 10 years ago,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   even without social media services
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   they could look at all the time.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   So just go back and tap into that 2009,
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   2008 version of yourself.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   You'll be perfectly informed.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   But I'm glad you bring it up, Julie,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   because this is one of the last traps.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   I think people that have a pretty good
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   relationship with technology,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   one of the last traps that still snags them
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   is this news thing.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   It really is.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   I think it's a storyline
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   of these services themselves.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   You've got to be connected.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   You've got to know what's going on.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   This is where everything's happening.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   It's not.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   There's plenty of ways to get enough news
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   without having to be staring
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   at your phone all day.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   All right. I think that's pretty good.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Good questions.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   So I want to move on here in a second
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   to our final segment.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   I have a cool topic that
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   a special guest is going to join me
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   to help me talk about.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   First, however, I want to mention
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   another one of the sponsors
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   that makes the show possible.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   And that is our friends at Ladder.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   L-A-D-D-E-R.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   You probably, if you have a family
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   or anyone who depends on you,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   you probably need more life insurance.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   It's the type of thing that,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   especially of a certain age,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   you begin to realize,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   oh, I need more life insurance
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   to whatever small thing
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   my employer offers.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   But you're procrastinating.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And why are you procrastinating?
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   Because it feels like
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   a complicated thing.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   How do you get insurance?
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Do you get that guy
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   who wears the red shirt
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   in the TV commercials
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   and the YouTube ad commercials?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Does he come over?
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   Like, how do you find that guy?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   Does he, like, give you
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   a bag of insurance?
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   We just don't know.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   We just, there's,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   insurance commercials are these
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   incredibly vague things on TV
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   where it's like funny people
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   and you're like, well,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   I don't even know what this means.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   So we put it off.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   So I'm going to tell you
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   how to get the life insurance you need
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   much more simply than hoping
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   that red shirt guy comes by.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   And that is to use Ladder.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Ladder is 100% digital.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   There are no doctors, needles,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   or paperwork involved
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   if you're applying
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   for $3 million in coverage or less.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   You just answer a few questions
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   about your health
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   in an application.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   You need just a few minutes
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   on a phone or laptop to apply.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   Their smart algorithms
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   work in real time.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   So you'll find out instantly
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   if you are approved.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   Ladder works with insurers
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   that have long proven histories
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   of paying claims.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   These are insurers
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   that are rated A and A+
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   by A and Best.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   So you can trust the insurers
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   that you end up working with.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   to see if you are instantly approved.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   That's LADDERlife.com/deep
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   ladderlife.com/deep
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I also want to talk about
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   My Body Tutor,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   which is run by my long time friend
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   Adam Gilbert.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   My Body Tutor is a 100%
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   online coaching program
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   that solves the biggest problem
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   in health and fitness,
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   which is lack of consistency.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   They do this by simplifying
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   the process into practical,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   sustainable behaviors.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Here's how it works.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   When you sign up with My Body Tutor,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   you are assigned a coach.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   This coach works with you directly
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   to figure out your nutrition plan
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   and your fitness plan.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   Here is your exact workouts
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   and when you're going to do them.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Here's what you're going to do with food.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   And then you check in with this coach
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   every single day online.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   They have a simple app.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   You tap a couple things or submit.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   You can also do it on the web
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   and you get feedback from your coach
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]   every day.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   So not only do you figure out
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   what you should be doing,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   you get daily accountability
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   on actually doing the work.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Knowing that a coach with which
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   you have a relationship
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   will know whether or not
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   you did your workout today,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   will know whether or not
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   you followed the nutrition plan
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   is incredibly effective and motivating.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   This is why My Body Tutor clients
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   rave about it.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   It gets results.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   So if you're serious about getting fit,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   Adam is giving Deep Questions listeners
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   $50 off their first month.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   All you have to do is mention
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   this podcast when you join.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   If you have questions,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Adam wants you to call or text.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   You can find his personal cell phone number
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   at the top of every page
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   on MyBodyTutor.com
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   so you know he's serious
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   about getting you results.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   So go to MyBodyTutor,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   T-U-T-O-R.com
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   and mention Deep Questions
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   to get $50 off.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   All right, Jesse,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   well, we're moving now
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   to our final segment.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   As longtime listeners know,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   in our final segment,
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   we typically go
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   in a different direction
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   than the rest of the episode.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And in particular,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   there's a topic that
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   a lot of listeners
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   have been sending me articles about
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   recently, so I figured
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   we should tackle this.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   And this is this notion
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   of the friendship recession.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Are we in a friendship recession?
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   If so, is it a problem?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   And if it's a problem,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   what's the right way to solve it?
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   What's the right way
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   to build from scratch
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   a robust series of friendships
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   in your life?
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   This seems really tightly connected
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   to our broader vision
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   and living a deeper life
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   in a distracted world,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]   especially in a world
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   where we have these social apps
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   and text messaging tools
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   that give us the illusion
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   of being connected to people,
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   but don't trick our brain
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   into thinking that we're actually
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   being social.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Real friends matter now
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   than they ever have before.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   So in order to talk about this,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   I'm going to bring on
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   a special guest.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   That's a longtime friend of mine
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   and a longtime friend of the show.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   It's a comedian and podcaster,
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   Jamie Kilstein.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   I'm bringing him on
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   because he recently went
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   through a process
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   of building up
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   a robust group of male friendships
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   in his 40s,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   so I figured he would have a lot
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   to teach us about what worked
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   and what didn't.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   So let's get Jamie on the line now
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   to talk about the friendship recession.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Jamie, I brought you on
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   because we were actually
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   just talking about this topic offline,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   and I was thinking,
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   "Wait a second. Save it.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   Let's do this in public,"
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   because I guess that's
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   what we do these days.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   Everything is in public.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   So anyways, thanks for coming on
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   and helping me figure out this topic.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   Now, is that term, though,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   "friendship recession,"
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   is that one you had heard,
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   or is that just us being geeky?
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Yeah, I was going to say,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   I haven't heard it
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   because I have friends
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   that I'm hanging out with
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   and not reading your dorky newspapers.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   No, it makes--
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   It's something that--
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   I haven't heard that term,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   but when you said it,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   it hit me so hard in my heart
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   that I was like, "Oh, yeah."
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   That--I mean, I think about--
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   It just automatically made me think
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   about the years I was just drowning
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   and didn't even think about
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   the fact that I had, like,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   no male friends
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   and that I was just trying to fill
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   the void with everything else,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   you know, girls, career,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   you know, whatever.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   And, yeah, so, I mean,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   it makes total sense.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   But I also think there are
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   some easy fixes we can get into.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   But, yeah, I'm here for it.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   And I'm also glad you introduced me
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   as your friend
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   because that would have been
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   a real sad turn to this segment.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Or just my only friend?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Maybe that would have set
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   the segment up better.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Although, dude,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I do feel like podcasters--
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   I don't want to get too esoteric,
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   but I do feel like we make our friends--
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   I mean, this will tie into, actually,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   social--I mean, I think a lot of people
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   have convinced themselves that
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   if they talk to a lot of people
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   on Twitter or social media
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   that they're actual friends.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   And it's like--
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   or, I mean, even, like,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   girls on OnlyFans.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   And it's like, no,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   that is not a real connection.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   It's artificial.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   And even for us, for podcasters,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   you know, I consider guys friends
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   and then I realize
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   I've just podcasted with them.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Right.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Frequent guest on your podcast
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   does not equate to a male--
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   male friendship.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   But I've been on your show,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   like, four times.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Like, come on, we're best friends.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   Let me show you--
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   I'll show you--
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   let me show you the actual article
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   that coined this term.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   We'll look at a couple of the claims here
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   and see if we're all on the same page.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   All right, so as far as I can tell,
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   this Daniel Cox article
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   from a couple years ago
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   from the National Review
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   is where the term
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   "friendship recession" was introduced.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   It was then supercharged
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   by Richard Reeves
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   doing a Big Think interview
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   more recently,
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   but I think this was
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   the original source.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   It just didn't spread as much back then.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   I guess we were still
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   thinking about pandemics and such.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   So here's a couple quotes
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   from this article
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   just to put us on the same page.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   "As Americans try to rebuild and reconnect,
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   a new survey conducted
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   by the Survey Center on American Life
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   finds that the social landscape
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   is far less favorable than it once was.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Over the past three decades,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   the number of close friends
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   Americans have has plummeted.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   This 'friendship recession'--
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   first use of that term in print, I believe--
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   is particularly bad for men.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   The percentage of men
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   with at least six close friends
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   fell by half since 1990,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   from 55% to 27%.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   The study also found
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   the percentage of men
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   without any close friends
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   jumped from 3% to 15%,
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   a five-fold increase.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Single men have fared worse."
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   I also heard the author, Richard Reeves,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   when he was talking about this
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   more recently,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   cite a study that said
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   "loneliness is equivalent,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   from a health perspective,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   to smoking 15 cigarettes a day."
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   All right, so we got a couple things--
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   - When you smoke a cigarette,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   you look cool.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   When you're just lonely,
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   what a bummer.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   - Well, and also,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   you're gonna get friends
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   if you smoke cigarettes,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   because everyone's gonna think you're awesome.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   - Guys, what we're trying to say is,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   go smoke cigarettes.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   What are you doing?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   Well, this is our podcast.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   Yeah, man, that, uh--
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   You know, I mean, jeez,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   I'm even thinking about--
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   I think I have really healthy
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   male friendships now
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   for the first time in my life.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   It's helped me a lot.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   But as you were reading that,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   I started to think, like,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   how rare it is.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   So, like, my brother
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   is still friends with, like,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   his best friends from high school.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   And my reaction to that is like,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   "What's wrong with you guys?"
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   When that probably is like,
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   "It's so healthy.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   It's so good."
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   And yeah, how that ties into loneliness,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   I really think that
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   a huge part of it is
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   we are getting these
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   false senses of friendship
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   from the internet.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   You know, "Oh, me and all these people
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   are mad at Ted Cruz on Twitter.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   That's my posse," right?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Or, again, I mean, OnlyFans--
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   Like, I've never--
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   I have girlfriends who have OnlyFan pages.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   I've never talked to them about it.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   But I've never subscribed.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   But apparently, it is, uh--
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   You know, you're talking
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   back and forth to them
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   like you're in a relationship
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   or like you're, you know, whatever.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   And so if you're already lonely
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   and nervous about the real world
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   or nervous to date or whatever,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   and then you just have these tools,
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   like, "Hey, here's a sense of it,"
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   I can just see how that would just, like,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   spiral into utter despair.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   Right, right.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   There's a technological element
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   also explaining this.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   I cited some of these studies
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   in my book "Digital Minimalism."
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   At the time, they seemed paradoxical,
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   but these studies that showed
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   when social media use went up,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   so did loneliness.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   And then the social psychologists
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   followed up and said,
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   "What's going on here?"
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   And they introduced this term
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   "social snacking," where they said,
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   "As you use social media more,
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   "you convince yourself that you're getting
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   "your daily dose of social interaction,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   "so you do less of the analog
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   "social interaction,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   "but our brain does not recognize
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   "digital interaction,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   "especially just text-based interaction,
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   "like on a text message screen
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   "or leaving comments on Instagram."
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Our brain doesn't recognize that as interacting.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   So you think you're social.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   Deeper in your brain, they're saying,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   "We haven't interacted with a human in weeks,"
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   and you feel sort of paradoxically lonely.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   So technology, it made this worse
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   is what it sounds like.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   - Yeah.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   Well, I mean, you eat two buckets
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   of KFC chicken, and you're like,
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   "All right, I'm really full and feel sick,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   "and I guess I got my protein intake,"
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   but it's just like,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   are you actually getting, like, substance?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   That's why when friends of mine,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   or me even, were really poor and younger,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   you just eat a bunch of fast food
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   because you're like, "Well, this is cheap,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   "and I'm getting so much,"
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   and it's like, "Yeah, but you're not.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   "You're getting so much, like,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   "you're getting all these empty calories.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   "You're not getting real nutrition,"
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   and so really similar.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   - Now, let me, before we get to,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   I wanna get to the specifics of your transformation,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   because it's very interesting to me,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   your friend transformation,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   but just because you're more in touch
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   with the culture around us than I am
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   because I'm married with a bunch of kids
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   and I'm too busy and don't know what's going on
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   and I'm a nerd.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   - That was Kyle's nice way of being like,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   "You're sad and don't have a family."
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   - Yeah, so when it comes to sad family-less people,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   I think the number one person, yeah,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   you and Jennifer Aniston.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]   Like, these are the two.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   No, but when you just look around,
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   you're out in the world more than I am.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   Do you buy that this is worse in general?
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   Like, when you're talking to other men,
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   when you see other men, you know,
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   in your social circles, are people,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   are you seeing this?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Are people lonely?
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   Are people talking about it?
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   What's the word from the street, Jamie?
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   - Yeah, men are desperate for connection.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   And it is, you know, it's hard, man.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   It's weird.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Because it's hard enough to find a girlfriend,
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   to find someone to date, to ask someone out,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   let alone you're kind of doing the same thing,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   but like with a dude, you know what I mean?
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Like, I even noticed that,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   and I'm sure the guys listening to this
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   can like cop to this, is I remember,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   I just became really good friends with my trainer,
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   the dude who trains me at the gym.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   And, you know, I would come home
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   and I would like light up to my girlfriend about him,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   just like you would when you met a girl.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   I was like, oh my God, Trev is like,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   he's so sweet and like, he's like really pushing me harder.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   I felt like I like, I PR today.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   And then we got in the sauna and like, man,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   we were talking about like spirituality.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   And suddenly like, as I'm describing him,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   I'm like, oh, this is how I would describe,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   oh my God, I just met this girl.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   She's so cute.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   Like we vibe on the same things.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   We have the same goals, blah, blah, blah.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   And, but it takes a little bit of like security, you know?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   I mean, Cal, when we grew up, everything was called gay.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   It's like, oh, you're showing emotion.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Oh, you're, you know, in touch with your feelings.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Like, oh, you're hanging out with that.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   And so like, I really do think there's this weird part in men
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   where it's like, we want so desperately that male connection.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   Jiu-Jitsu is so popular.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   You know, we've gone from handshakes to like bro hug,
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   but like full hug is only for like really good.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   Like there is, we crave that camaraderie,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   but it's also like, we don't want to be weird.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   Especially as you get older.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   I mean, making friends in general is super hard.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   - What, I mean, do you think something has changed about that?
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   So in other words, in 1990, that was the end point of that article.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   That like in 1990 compared to now,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   there's been this five fold increase in not having close friends, et cetera.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   Was there, I mean, there must be a pathway to male friendships
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   that existed then that doesn't now.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   Because of course it's not that in 1990,
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   we were much more comfortable expressing feelings.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   That's when we grew up, right?
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   As you were saying, this was where, yeah.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   If you were in touch with your feelings, that was gay.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   But if you used a phrase, you're in touch with your feelings,
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   that too is gay.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   And so it all sort of recursively piled up on itself.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   So what was it I wonder?
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   There must've been, maybe it's just the role of work.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Maybe it was more stability and location.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   You didn't move so much.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Maybe it was church.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   Maybe it was family earlier.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   There's gotta be something that was a cheat code for male friendships.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   And when that was removed,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   it was suddenly to use a metaphor from our childhood,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   you couldn't beat the boss in Contra
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   because you no longer had the super gun or whatever.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   I don't really know what that would be.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   I don't know if you have any thoughts about 1990 versus now.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   No.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   So I think that it definitely has to do with the internet
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   and it just has to do with like less social gatherings in general.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   So I was always a girlfriend guy.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   I believe the term is codependent.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   And I would always just, my relationship was everything.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   And when I broke up,
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   that's why this breakup going through now is super weird.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   And actually I'm leaning on male friendships for the first time
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   because usually I lose a girlfriend and I go,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   "I gotta go to the next girlfriend."
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   Like that's the only option for connection.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   And so I think like if you look at 1990,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   there were just more gatherings.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   More people went to church.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   If you were a liberal, you were unions.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   You weren't working from home as much.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Yeah, you went to an office.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   You went to an office every day.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   The last time I had friends was like my football team in high school.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   And I've been like getting out of shape.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   It's like go to a gym, join a CrossFit, do Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   I mean, if I didn't do Jiu-Jitsu, I'd probably still have zero male friends.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   That was the thing for me.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   So you do something cool and challenging with guys who, you know, you--
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   Like most of my male friends I look up to.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   And I don't know if people think, you know, when they're looking for friends
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   that like they have to be the cool one.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   And it's like no, you don't want a bunch of little like mean girl underlings.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Like you will be good enough.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   People love helping other people, you know.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   I mean the fighters I hang out with are the best fighters in the world.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   And they're not like you can't hang out with us
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   until you become the best fighter in the world.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   I give something else to that circle
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   and then they build me up and make me a better fighter.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   And so literally just like, again, it sounds like they didn't advise you.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   Shoot your shot.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   Well, okay, and it's like when you're talking about
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   hanging out with the best fighters in the world,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   I can't help but think about the guy from Bloodsport
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   whose main fighting style was to just boom.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   The guy with the beard and the American with the Harley Davidson shirt.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   But him hanging out with Jean-Claude Van Damme
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   or David Dukes as the character's name
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   was probably really life affirming for him
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   until he was put into a coma by being too cocky
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   about knocking out the guy with the giant pecs.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   But I think it's very apt, right?
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   It raised his element.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   But okay, so this is what I want to get to now.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   So if we're going to talk about solutions.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   If Steven Seagal befriended all of those dreadlocks Jamaicans
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   instead of killing them,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   would he have found a healthier inner life balance?
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   I think so.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   I just read a book about Steven Seagal, by the way.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   This is a different story.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   Okay, we'll talk about that afterwards.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   I became friends with his daughter who's very nice,
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   but I have so many questions for her that I'm just like,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   like sitting on.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   Oh my God, it was such a weird--
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   It was a whole book about 1980s action films
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   and all of those actors.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   Weird, interesting, fantastical, terrible.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   It's just-- Okay, anyways.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   We'll put that aside.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   I think what we're trying to build towards
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   is we would like Steven Seagal to be our friend.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   All right, but let's go back to--
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   Let's go to your life though, right?
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Because my understanding is you recently added--
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   You made male friendships really for the first time
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   in a long time, a big part of your life.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   My understanding of your timeline--
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Tell me if I have this wrong.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   But here's my Jamie Kilstein timeline.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   All right.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   This always makes me nervous.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   You're living in LA, more or less just hanging out with Moby.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   Then you move to Arizona.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   And as far as I can tell,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   you were living in a retirement community.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   So you're essentially hanging out with old ladies, yeah,
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   and elderly Mexican men.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   Then you move to Austin.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   And somehow, once you got to Austin,
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   you now seem to have a lot of friends
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   that you do things with.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   All right, so give us the story here.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   How did you get friends?
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   As a 40-year-old male at the time in Austin, Texas,
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   what happened?
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   Okay, so here's what I think happened.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   And again, this is very similar to dating advice.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   That time in Arizona, when I was kind of a hermit--
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   so I moved to Arizona with an ex-girlfriend of mine
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   because we were in LA,
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   and we were clearly settling for each other.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   But we were both nice enough.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   It was my only dating app relationship.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   And we were just like--
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   she was tired of creepy guys.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   I was tired of LA girls on the internet.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   And we just so desperately wanted to make it work
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   that we were like, "You know what?
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   "It's probably LA's fault.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   "It's probably not us.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   "We should just leave LA."
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   And so I end up in--
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   so we literally picked a place randomly on the map.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   And so we were outside of Tucson, Arizona.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   And not surprisingly, we broke up
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   probably like a year after living in Arizona,
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   like right before COVID happened.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   So my first time as being a single adult male
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   was over COVID,
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   which is--oh, boy.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   It's really like a do-or-die situation,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   which is like, "Am I going to kill myself?
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   "Or am I going to do what I probably should have done
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   "a long time ago, which is figure out who I am?"
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   The year that I spent by myself
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   was the first time that I figured out who I really was.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   And I couldn't try to fill that gap.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   So now I had this breakup.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   It was a loving breakup. It was a sad breakup.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   I had this breakup with my girlfriend.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   And I have to fight the urge to be like,
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   "Okay, just find a new girlfriend."
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   Because usually we're so used to kind of like adapting
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   to whoever, like, the next person is.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   COVID did not allow me to do--
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   there was no other option.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   I couldn't date. I couldn't have friends.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   I couldn't do any of this stuff.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   And so for your listeners who are really lonely right now
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   and are struggling, I can say that the first thing
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   you should do before you date,
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   before you even make male friends,
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   is figure out, like, who are you?
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   Because that year, I was reading books.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   I was finally watching the movies I wanted to watch.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   I was, like, taking walks in nature.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   I started meditating.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   I was doing all these things on my own.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   - Yeah. So what you're saying is--
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   so you got familiar with yourself.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   - Yep.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   - Took the time to actually be with yourself.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   And I would add the addendum to that,
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   which you're not going to do by spending more time on screen.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   So we'll just add in that caveat.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   Notice every example Jamie gave--walks, meditation,
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   getting back into activities he had enjoyed before,
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   reading books, watching movies.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   None of this was fight on Twitter with your crew.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   - Or, you know, get your Instagram follower.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   - Twitter. Fanbust. Only fans.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   Like, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   - Okay. - Yeah.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   - All right. So then you got to know yourself.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   And then it sounds like what happened was
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   you used that to identify meaningful analog activity.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Now that you had the self-reflection,
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   you could identify--like, for you, for example,
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   you got back into jiu-jitsu,
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   which is something you had done very seriously
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   earlier in your life. - Yep.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   - And then church after that,
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   which again was coming out of self-reflection.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   You were now very--you were familiar enough with yourself
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   that when you were sort of looking around
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   and hanging out with the sort of spiritual,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   not religious types, like, "This isn't quite right.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   I think a church, but this church."
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   That required self-knowledge, right?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   - Yeah. I showed up at church and was like,
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   "Do I hate Moby?"
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   But yeah, no, I mean, like, dude,
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   my superpower and the reason I'm not dead
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   is, like, being able to, like, be self-analytical.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   It started as self-hate, which sometimes can backfire.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   But yeah, just being like, "Why am I here?"
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   Because I also want to add that
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   if you're looking for friends or a girl,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   going to a bar every night, just like screens,
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   also isn't the answer. - Right.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   - Because you feel like, "Well, I'm surrounded by people,"
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   but you're numbing yourself out,
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   you're having vapid conversations,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   if you can even have a conversation over the music.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000]   Like, I always joke that I want to meet my next girlfriend
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   just, like, at a bookstore. - Yeah.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   - Like, I just want to, like, we accidentally both reach
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   for, like, the same graphic novel,
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   the same Calvin and Hobbes book or something.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   And--but I think that--
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   and when we were talking, you know,
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   right before we went on air about this,
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   I did not think that this is where--
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   that this was nowhere in my head
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   that I was going to veer in this direction.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   But as I talk about it, I realize,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   oh, my God, this is the most important thing you can do,
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   which sounds counterintuitive
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   'cause we're talking about being lonely.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   So it's like, why would you want to spend more time with yourself?
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000]   There is such a difference between, you know,
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   if I stayed at home all day
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   and just scrolled on Instagram and watched porn
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   and, you know, texted my ex,
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   like, yeah, dude, that's a real lonely day by myself.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   But if I write and I go to the gym
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   and maybe instead of having coffee here, I go to Starbucks
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   and I ask the barista how they're doing
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   and I have that interaction and then I meditate
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   and then I journal what I've been--
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   like, I'm waking up early, I'm not sleeping.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   You know, I wake up at 5.15. I don't have a job.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   I'm an artist. I'm a comic.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   I wake up at 5.15 every day
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   so that I can have that time to myself.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   - Yeah. - Man, when I'm around people,
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000]   that's how I can be my authentic self.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   And then when you're being your authentic self,
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   you will attract people who are like, "Oh, I like that guy."
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   And you will also be able to walk away from
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   a circle of friends that maybe that's just, you know, whatever.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   Whatever the hookup version is of friends.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   Yeah, yeah. Okay, so then there's one final step here
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   to get out-- to touch on.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   So we have the self-reflection leads to activities
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   that are deeply meaningful.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   You're meeting people through those activities.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   So you're now surrounded by people
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   who are on the same wavelength.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   So this is clearly going to be a source of
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   high-quality friendships.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   I guess the final piece then is there's still a little bit
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   of trigger polling that requires a little strategizing.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   We hinted at this earlier.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   But now it's like, "I really like these guys."
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   And we're on the same wavelength,
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   and they make me better,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   and I really like hanging out with them.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   So then there's that final piece, right?
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   Okay, now I have to just have the courage to say--
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   - Yeah. - And this is the dating analogy,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   but, "Hey, you want to come watch the fight?"
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000]   Or, "Do you want to come do whatever?"
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   So what did you discover about that?
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   Is that as bad as men fear,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   or is it just something you got to just go for
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   and break the ice? - Yeah, I'm running through,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   because I'm also--I'm an introvert,
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   and so I'm not good at it.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   I seem very bubbly and social in social settings.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   It's just 'cause I'm projecting, and I'm terrified.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   - Yeah. - So I definitely haven't been like,
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   you know, "Hey, do you want to go get coffee?"
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   I mean, I have with my pastors, but that's like their job.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   I feel like when my pastors hang out with me,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   that's like if I was like, "I had sex,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   but I paid an escort."
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   It's like, "Well, she's supposed to do that."
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   My pastors see I'm sad.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   But like, okay, so...
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   Be someone you would want to hang out with
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   is number one, right?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   So if I go to jujitsu,
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   and I sit in the corner and scowl at everybody,
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   I'm probably not going to get an invite to hang out.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   But if every time I go to spar with someone,
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   I go, "Hey, man, what's your name?"
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   Great, and then we roll, and I go,
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]   "Hey, when you did this, that was really good,"
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   And then maybe they start coming and asking me for advice,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   you know, whatever.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   Maybe you're the funny person.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   Maybe you're the person who just asks people how their day is.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   Maybe you just, you know, my main jujitsu coach
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   was this guy Marcelo Garcia, who was the best in the world,
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   so his gym was like packed.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   And every day, he would go up, and he would walk around
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   while people were chatting, and he would shake everyone's hand.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   And so I try to do that when I go to a gym.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   I try to, like, you know, if I'm teaching the kids' class,
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   I'll shake the parents' hands, stuff like that.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   And then through that, people just feel comfortable around you,
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   and maybe they start asking you questions,
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   and maybe they just become your gym buddy.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   I have dozens of gym buddies who I've never hung out with,
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   but they're also people that if I show up,
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   and they go, "Hey, how are you doing?"
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   "Hey, man, I'm struggling. I got this breakup."
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   And they will give me amazing advice before class.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   Then usually in these places, there are, like, group activities.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   So if you're going to a CrossFit gym or a jujitsu place,
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   chances are, yeah, when there's a big pay-per-view,
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   they're going to watch the fights.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   And, you know, you can be so likable that they invite you.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   There have definitely been times where I'm like,
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   I just have a good enough sense that I'm like, "These guys like me."
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   Like, they follow me on Instagram, even if I don't follow them.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   I think they like me.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   That I'll even be like, "Hey, guys, if there's ever room,
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   I'd love to watch the fights with you."
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   You don't have to say, "Can I come and watch Izzy fight this Saturday?"
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   But you can go, "Hey, if you're ever going out."
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   One of my church friends, this girl, AJ,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   the day after the breakup, I go, "Hey, man, I got to be more social."
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   I know I usually say no when you guys invite me out,
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   but if there's ever anything going on, can you at least float it to me?
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   And she goes, "Oh, my God, I'm having a birthday dinner tonight."
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   I was like, "I didn't want to invite you. I figured you wouldn't want to go.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   Do you want to go?"
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   And I went, and then I met a bunch of different church friends,
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   and now they've hit me up.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   The one piece of advice I really want to give,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   because I know you won't give it on another piece, on another episode,
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   is this is where social media can actually be kind of good.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   And maybe--I don't know if it's this--I think it's for normie people,
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   because I have a bit of an audience,
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   so people think it's--in my real life, if they don't know what I do,
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   they think it's cool and they follow me.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   But I have had a couple people that I've met from jujitsu or church or whatever
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   that they'll find me on Instagram, and that kind of tells me,
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   "Oh, this person likes me."
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   And maybe when they write me on Instagram--
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   I can't write every random person back, but when they write me, I go,
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   "Oh, shit, Nehemiah from church is hitting me up about my story.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   Maybe I actually have more in common with him than I thought."
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   And that will kind of--that'll be an icebreaker,
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   because I don't want to just--I have very low self-confidence,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   so I don't assume people like me.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   But if I see someone's followed me on Instagram, I'm like,
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   "Oh, okay," but then where you will agree is then it's your job
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   to not keep that relationship in Instagram.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   Right. I mean, you're describing 2010 social media, where it really was,
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   "Okay, my friends follow this. We keep up with each other."
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   And sometimes I get a second-order connection, like a friend of a friend
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   who I sort of know is a way for them to interact with me.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   And that was the heyday of social media. It was just like 2.0.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   Yes, that's different than being like, "I'm friends with Tucker Carlson
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   because we both hate the same people on Twitter."
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   Yeah, he liked a tweet of mine. All right, this is excellent.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   So I'm going to do what I do, which is try to reduce this all down
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   to step-by-step advice for my listeners.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   So this is the Jamie Kilstein prescription.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   Well, first of all, the setup here is that, especially for males,
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   friendships are really important, especially as you get into your 30s and 40s,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   as Jamie was talking about.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   It is, if anything, like a buffer against hard things that happen in your life,
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   a source of motivation, et cetera. So you need them.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   Don't just keep in touch with your high school buddies or just know--
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   I don't want to mess up your list, but I didn't go into nearly as much detail on that.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   I was trying to get to the how-to, but it has saved my life, 100%.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   I have been going through so much for the last decade, 15 years of my life,
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   that having strong male friends who I look up to be able to--
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   When I'm struggling, this sounds so cheesy, but put a hand on my shoulder
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   and be like, "Dude, I see how hard you're working.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   You are going to be so good. You have no idea how far you've come
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   since even the first day I met you."
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   When another man tells you that, you just go, "Oh, sh--."
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   That's so much different than even your wife being like, "Babe, you got this."
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   It's just different.
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   Yeah, it's been-- Yeah.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000]   Right. So fundamental. It saved Jamie's life. Fundamental. Okay.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000]   So how do we do this? If we're going to make a prescription here,
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   one, I would say go back to my digital declutter is a good starting place,
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   which we talk about in digital minimalism, where you take 30 days away
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   from all this optional technology, do self-reflection experimentation.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   We usually talk about the digital declutter just as a way of figuring out
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   how to update your technology use, but now let's add that on
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   as the first step towards upgrading your friendship situation
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   because during that 30 days of reflection experimentation,
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   you get to know yourself better.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   Now, typically, we say at the end of that 30 days,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   "Oh, look at your tech use. Fine." But let's add a new obligation here.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000]   At the end of that 30 days, join something.
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   Join something based on what you discovered during that 30-day declutter
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   that is going to surround you with other people
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   who are on the same wavelength with your values.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   And I would add to that, being around those people will probably also bring
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]   other things into your radar to join.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   I mean, Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's a synergy
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000]   between you getting back into jiu-jitsu and the church
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   because there's crossovers, right?
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000]   Some of the people that the fighters you were meeting were also religious,
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   and so these things cross-pollinate. They weren't two separate thoughts.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   It was like once you're in the world of people you admire
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   and like to be around, other meaningful things emerge.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   I mean, I got that right, right? It was all these things sort of mixed together.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   Yeah, and that actually, that's another great tip, which is like
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000]   once you know yourself and you have these interests
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   and these things that you love that are kind of different or whatever,
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   like if I meet a dude at church who, you know, you love stand-up comedy
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000]   and he loves stand-up comedy, suddenly you go like,
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]   "Oh my God, did you watch the new Shane Gillis special?"
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   And now you're bonding over nerd stuff.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   Or they play guitar or, you know, like jiu-jitsu is a huge one.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   Like I'll have so many people come up to me just because they see my ears
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   and they go, "You train?" And like I'm talking to that guy.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]   There's no way I'm not talking to that guy.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   But it's also if you have nothing that you do
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   or nothing that you're interested in, you're just like bored.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   Online.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a lot harder to connect.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   Right. Okay, so then that brings to the final step.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   So now you've joined things based off the values that you've rediscovered
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   during this sort of period of reflection.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   Now you're surrounded by interesting people.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000]   And then the final step is to put yourself out there.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   Like, "Hey, let me know if you're going to watch the game or the fight
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   or go to see this film."
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   "I've been coming to this Trout Boy meeting for two months now.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]   Time to make some friends."
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   Like next time you raid a government building, let me know.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   I mean, I have like this civilian commando gear.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   You need like a good tech logo on Instagram, yeah.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:52.000]   I've got this bear shaman, you know, mask helmet.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   Look, I have it, you know, whatever.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   You're raiding a building.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]   Just going to collect dust.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   I'm not using it, you know, not using it.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   Let me know what could go wrong.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   I think everyone will forgive us.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   Yeah, that's a good turn.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   Yeah, good turn.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   Okay, so that--but here's what's cool about that advice though,
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   is like right now if you're listening to this and you're thinking,
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000]   "You know what? This is me. I'm lonely.
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   I'm online all the time, and I'm feeling lonely.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.000]   I have no backstop."
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   This plan we're talking about, this is six months from right now
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   potentially to a very upgraded friend relationship,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   a month or so of self-reflection.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   You join things, get involved for a few months.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   That's it.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   You do that, you're going to have at least a few new friends,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   and then it's going to snowball from there, you know,
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000]   and then like you're going to tighten some friendships,
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   and others will lose.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.000]   You'll find others, but that's it.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   Like six months from now--because it went fast for you, Jamie,
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000]   so like give our listeners hope.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000]   Like six months from now, you really could be in a very positive
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   social situation, friend-wise.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000]   And that leads to everything else, you know.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   It's like that builds you up, so you become a more confident person.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000]   You being a more confident person leads to other things in your life.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   You know, this is very hard for me to say because I've been flamed
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   by a lot of like constantly online people.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   But what I will say is like while it is not healthy
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   to only have these relationships online,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   clearly if you're listening to this, like you're intelligent,
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   you're funny, right?
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   Like you make people laugh on Twitter or Reddit or whatever.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   Those skills that you have online, it's going to be nerve-wracking
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000]   at first, but they do translate.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   They do--like if you can make people laugh online,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000]   you can make people laugh in real life.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   It's just about building up that confidence.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   And that's going to be a step-by-step process.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   And then show yourself grace, you know, if you do get nervous
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   and you're like, "Oh, this is so stupid."
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   You know, ever since I started reading or listening to self-development
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   podcasts or even with religion, the worst you can feel sometimes
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   is before the breakthrough where you go, "I'm doing the right stuff."
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   Like, "I go to church now. Why would I have a breakup?"
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   You know, or, "I'm trying to make friends.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000]   I did everything Cal said and I showed up at the fights
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   and I was too nervous and didn't say anything.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   I guess there's no hope." Nope.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000]   That's just the first step.
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   And then the next time you're like, "I'm going to talk a little more."
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   And then the next time, then you just keep piling on wins.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   - Yep, and you look back and say, "I'm glad I started."
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000]   - Exactly. - Right, because you moved it there.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   All right, well, excellent. Well, this was great, Jamie.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000]   Just a reminder for the audience, your podcast is The Back Row
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   with Jamie Kilstein. What's that website, Jamie?
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000]   - Yeah, you can go to backrowpod.com.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000]   And there's the YouTube channel and I have a newsletter I do
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000]   every week now where I'm writing about mental health
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   and stuff like that.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   Yeah, we're talking about the mental health spiritual journey,
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   but also getting a little more into culture, politics,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000]   and trying to bring people together and laugh at the ridiculousness
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]   of it all.
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   - Yeah, sounds--something to do with friends.
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]   All right, Jamie, well, thanks for joining me.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]   I look forward to talking to you again in four months.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000]   - Thanks. - That's the way we do it.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   - Bye, friend. - Old school.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   All right, see ya.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000]   All right, so there we have it.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   Thanks to Jamie for coming on and talking to us
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]   about the friendship recession.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   I want to mention, actually, Jamie's sister, Stephanie Krause,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   has a book out that I thought would be relevant to our audience.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000]   I know Stephanie through other reasons, and we were talking
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]   about this book recently, her new book.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000]   It's called "Whole Child, Whole Life,
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000]   10 Ways to Help Kids Live, Learn, and Thrive."
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   So in particular, you worry about your kids and technology.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   Stephanie is great on these matters, so check out that book,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   "Whole Child, Whole Life, 10 Ways to Help Kids Live,
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   Learn, and Thrive."
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]   That's author Stephanie Krause, who happens to be Jamie's sister.
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]   There we go, Jesse. It's a small world.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]   - Yep. - Everyone's connected to everyone.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]   So hopefully you like the show.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   I should probably also remind you, if you do like the show,
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000]   leave a review.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]   There's been some nice reviews left recently,
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]   and I really appreciate that.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000]   Subscribe as well, and whatever podcast listener you use,
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   that does help the podcast networks show the show
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000]   to more potential listeners.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   So review or subscribe does help.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   Otherwise, that's it for today's episode.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   We'll be back next week with the next show.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:47.000]   Hey, if you like today's episode, I think you'll also like episode 263,
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000]   which gives a four-month plan for completely overhauling your life.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000]   I think you will enjoy it. Check it out.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]   So today's deep question,
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000]   how can I reinvent my life in four months?
