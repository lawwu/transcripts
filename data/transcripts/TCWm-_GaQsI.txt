[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   I'm waiting in my weakness he may be deep in it.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.640]   I be lying through my teeth to say I don't resent it.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.000]   Even as I write these lines I'm close to tears.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.280]   My body ain't been working right for seven years.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.400]   So miss me with that keep your chin up try to smile.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.840]   Bro I'm 26 I should feel better by a mile.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.920]   That's from Trip Lee's track "Sweet Victory" off his latest album "Rise".
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.440]   We're talking with Trip Lee this week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.680]   And we are honored to have you on brother and we respect you a lot here at Desiring
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.200]   God and I want to dive in deep from the start and ask you about personal suffering.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.500]   Something a 27 year old shouldn't have much experience with but as the track explains
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.120]   you do in the form of chronic fatigue.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.880]   And obviously for a guy like you who dreams big this trial impacts your life in a big
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   way.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.280]   How much does this continue to influence your life physically now and what has this trial
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.360]   taught you about the goodness of God?
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.120]   I've had chronic fatigue syndrome for about eight years now.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.200]   There have been seasons where it really has been devastating to my life.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.800]   I mean especially at first it really came out of nowhere and it does affect my life
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.520]   in really big ways.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.800]   And it's always been really hard to kind of help others understand that.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.680]   You know the ways that it can wreck your life to never have adequate energy.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.960]   And the way I try to explain it sometimes is that energy is kind of like the fuel that
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.360]   we need for every little task we do, even small things like thinking or reading scripture
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.560]   or having conversations with people.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.200]   And that's you know, energy is one of those things that I did not realize how much of
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.400]   a gift from God it was until I didn't have it.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240]   And so it does affect my life a lot physically even now.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.920]   And there are seasons where because I'm unable to be as reliable as I want to be because
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.400]   my body is so undependable, you know, and it's so I never know when I will and won't
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400]   have energy.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200]   And there are seasons where I feel like I just fall short in every area of my life and
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.480]   where I feel like I disappoint everyone in my life because I'm not able to be as reliable
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.000]   and dependable as I want to be where I don't feel like a good artist or good author or
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   good rapper or good husband and father or good pastor.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.420]   And it can be so discouraging.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.960]   So in addition to just feeling physically awful, it affects me just kind of internally
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.520]   and you know just feeling discouraged.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.400]   I mean one of the things that it's taught me, I think probably the main thing that it's
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.200]   taught me is really simple is that I'm weak.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.040]   And when we're doing well physically or other ways, we can kind of live under the illusion
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.320]   that we're really strong, that we have it all together and that you know my job's doing
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   well just because I'm working hard and my health's good because I eat good.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.960]   But trials really have a way of putting your weakness in your face and leaving it there.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.120]   When we're doing well, that weakness may be kind of off in the back but not as aware of
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   it.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.880]   Trials is like holding that weakness up as a picture and just putting it in your face
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.120]   all the time.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.040]   And chronic weakness is like a nonstop daily reminder that we're weak and we desperately
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.040]   need God.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   And I think of like a second Corinthians 12 where Paul talks about his thorn in the flesh
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.240]   and he makes clear that true strength comes from weakness.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   I mean he ends that little section by saying, "For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.720]   And he's saying this because that's when the power of Christ rests on him.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.200]   And so I feel like I've spent the last few years just pleading with God that I would
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.120]   be able to say, along with Paul, that I can boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.800]   so that the power of Christ can rest on me.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.360]   And that's been something I've been really praying God would do.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.640]   And it's taught me that God's goodness doesn't always look the way I want it to.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.120]   God is always good.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.760]   But that doesn't mean that God always answers my prayers, even as I pray them for years.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.080]   And it doesn't mean that God always makes seasons easy and shows me what He's doing
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   right away.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.000]   And then sometimes it takes searching Scripture and asking God for grace to see how we still
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.120]   good in the midst of really hard things.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.920]   And you know, anytime that I do something, whether it's a book or an album, I never feel
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.840]   like I just cruise through the finish line.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840]   Like, man, that was easy.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   I always feel like I'm kind of limping and dragging myself through.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.480]   And so what it's shown me is that every time I do something and that it's fruitful, it's
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.360]   not because of my strength, because my strength was not on display.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.680]   It's because of God's.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.440]   My weakness was on display and it made space for God's strength to show through all the
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.720]   more beautifully.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.240]   My physical weakness is just a reminder of weakness all the way through and through.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.440]   And you know, it's really not possible for me to in any given day feel like I have the
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.560]   strength that I need to do everything that I need to do.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   And it's just a great reminder of my desperate need for God.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   Amen.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   Thank you for your testimony.
