[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   A frequent listener of the podcast emails in this question, "Pastor John, my name is
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280]   Soren.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.980]   I am from Romania, but living right now in Germany.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.520]   My question is this.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.120]   How do you understand John 15, 1 through 10 in a Calvinistic way?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.920]   Because the text tells us things like this, 'He cuts off every branch that bears no fruit.'
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.060]   Or, 'If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers.
[00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.880]   Such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire, and burned.'
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.520]   What do you say, Pastor John?"
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.100]   That's a really crucial question because the biblical, Reformed, Calvinistic view of union
[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.640]   with Christ, of "I am in a branch," is that if we have been united to Christ in a new
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.900]   birth and in an effectual calling, we will never be cut off from Christ.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.400]   We will be eternally secure.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.080]   And we base that on lots of texts.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.800]   For example, John 10, 27, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.080]   I give them eternal life.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.200]   They will never perish.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.640]   No one will snatch them out of my hand.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.800]   My Father who has given them to me is greater than all.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.160]   No one will be able to snatch them out of my Father's hand."
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.520]   The point there is, if you're my sheep, you're secure.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   Or Romans 8, 30, this is, for me, the most compelling.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.480]   "Those whom he pardestined, he called; and those whom he called, he justified; and those
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.000]   whom he justified, he glorified."
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.920]   Nobody falls out of that chain.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.120]   If you're justified, he says, you will be glorified.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.280]   There are no justified people who get lost between justification and glorification.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.680]   Or Philippians 1, 6, "I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring it to
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680]   completion in the last day."
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.000]   Or 1 Corinthians 1, 8, "He will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of Christ.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.040]   God is faithful by whom you were called."
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.360]   Into the fellowship of his Son.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.480]   Or 1 John 2, 19, "They went out from us because they were not of us.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.080]   For if they had been of us, they would not have gone out.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.800]   But they went out that it might be plain that they were not of us."
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   So John is explaining being cut off there, being thrown out, as not being a part of us
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   in the first place.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   So lots of texts show that those who are truly born of God and truly called are secure forever.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.880]   So then we come to John 15 and we read verse 2.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.720]   "Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.800]   And every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruit."
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800]   Now, what does "take away" mean?
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.640]   I've heard people try to solve this problem by saying, "Well, it doesn't mean take away.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.220]   It means lift up.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.760]   So you prop up the branch so it can bear more fruit."
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.040]   That won't work.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.840]   It won't work because of verse 6.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.560]   "If anyone does not abide in me, he's thrown away like a branch and withers.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.000]   And the branches are gathered and thrown into the fire and burned."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.840]   So there are people who are attached to Jesus who go to hell.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.300]   So what do we make of this?
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.480]   We could say, if you were minded to, that John is contradicting himself, because in
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.400]   chapter 10 it just says the opposite.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   Or you could give John, who's very worthy of our trust, the benefit of the doubt and
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.240]   say, "Okay, you don't mean for us to press this image that far.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.120]   What are you saying?"
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.720]   And I think what John is saying is that there is a kind of attachment to Jesus that is not
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.880]   a saving attachment.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:52.040]   There's a kind of union with the vine that is not a saving union.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.640]   And therefore, if those get cut off, they are not compromising the doctrine of eternal
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.040]   security because they were never saved in the first place.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.200]   Now, the reason I think that's not special pleading is because of the numerous examples
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.600]   in the New Testament of that sort of thing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Here's one of the clearest.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Judas.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.920]   Judas was chosen by Jesus.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.120]   He was one of the twelve apostles.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.040]   He had a relationship with Jesus.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.000]   When they went out to heal and to cast out demons, there's no evidence that they all
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.440]   said, "How come Judas can't do this?"
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.840]   Judas did it.
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.080]   He cast out demons.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.640]   He healed the sick.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.700]   And nobody wondered why he couldn't.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.260]   And he did it in the name of Jesus.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.060]   And he was not saved.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.340]   He was not born again.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.040]   He was not elect.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.360]   He was, Jesus said, a son of perdition.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.320]   And it was written in the Old Testament that he was going to betray Jesus.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   John 17, 12.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.600]   Jesus says, "I have guarded them."
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.320]   This is like, "I have kept all my branches."
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.780]   "I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost, except the son of destruction
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.620]   that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.660]   So, there was nothing surprising here to Jesus.
[00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.800]   He chose to have in his band and to give unusual power to Judas.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.560]   And so if anybody looked at this, they'd say, "Whoa, that branch is in the vine."
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   And it was, in that sense.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.160]   But it wasn't in the "born again," effectually called sense.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.440]   Here's another illustration.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.960]   Matthew 7, 22.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   Jesus says this, "On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.360]   your name and cast out demons in your name and do many works in your name?'
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.880]   And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.960]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.980]   Those are Judas-type people.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.560]   They really have been in the church a long time.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.560]   They've benefited in all kinds of ways from their walk with Christian people and their
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.240]   external connection with Jesus Christ.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   And they're performing certain kinds of wondrous works, and they're not saved.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.680]   And here's the last one.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.840]   1 Corinthians 13, 2.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.480]   Paul said the same thing.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.080]   "If I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.320]   have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love, I am nothing."
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:33.440]   The mark of the truly born-again person is not an attachment to Jesus that can do miracles,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.560]   but rather an attachment to Jesus that loves.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.040]   The fruit of the Spirit is the mark of the true branch.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.480]   And I think that's the point.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.360]   If you read on down further in John 15, "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.840]   Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit."
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.320]   There's an abiding, there's an abiding that's real.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.680]   And there's an artificial grafting that's not real.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.220]   "Apart from me, you can do nothing."
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.360]   So I think John 15 does not contradict eternal security, does not contradict the Reformed
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:19.760]   Calvinistic understanding of perseverance of the saints, but it does warn that true
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   saving union with the vine is more than church membership, it's more than ministry, it's
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.040]   more than miracles.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.200]   It's bearing the fruit of love.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.380]   And speaking of union with Christ, our 2014 Conference for Pastors is dedicated to this
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   very theme.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.340]   St. Clair Ferguson and Michael Horton will join you, Pastor John, to speak on this remarkable
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.940]   reality of union with Christ.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.440]   Paul Tripp and Jared Wilson will also be in town speaking among others, and this all happens
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.520]   in Minneapolis in about two months.
