[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.020]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.800]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.620]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.920]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.760]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.200]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.360]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.600]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.460]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.800]   But don't forget,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.240]   although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.520]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.060]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.080]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to welcome you today.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.200]   And as we look toward the beginning
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.680]   of our fall communities,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.120]   I've got a great guest
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.880]   who is going to usher you into thinking
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.240]   about the challenge years.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.040]   I have with me today, Tim Knott,
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.880]   who is a lead curriculum developer
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.560]   with Classical Conversations Multimedia.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.720]   Tim, welcome.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.860]   - Hey, Lisa, good to be with you.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.020]   - I always like to have times
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.260]   when we can talk and think together.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.000]   I always learn something new
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.960]   and you always push me to think
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.860]   in a different way about something.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.700]   So I'm looking forward to sharing that
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.060]   with our listeners today.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060]   I want to ask you as I just get to know you,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.940]   when you were a little kid,
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.780]   did you like challenges?
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.900]   - I think it depended a lot
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.660]   on what kind of challenge you're talking about.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.320]   I loved to go and play outside
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.040]   with my brother or my friends
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.820]   and we would build tree forts
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.440]   and go down and explore the woods.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.280]   And so we would invent
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.440]   all kinds of challenges for ourselves.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.700]   And those kinds of challenges were just the best.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.240]   We would, too much to my mother's chagrin,
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.080]   challenge one another
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.520]   to see who could climb the tallest
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.540]   in the pine tree
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.880]   that had all the little tiny branches at the top.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.820]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.560]   - And I loved the challenges
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.140]   of playing board games with my dad.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.600]   But other kinds of challenges weren't my favorite.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200]   I was never all that terribly motivated
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   by competitive sports.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   So it kind of depended
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.000]   what kind of challenge you put in front of me.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.520]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that's really true.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.800]   Now, I do think that most of the little kids
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.920]   that I have known
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.320]   have loved pushing the envelope
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.400]   at one time or another.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.280]   The kind that you're talking about, though,
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.200]   who can throw the rock the farthest,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.000]   or yeah, who can climb the highest in the tree
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.420]   or go farthest down the path or whatever.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.200]   And so, yeah, those kinds of challenges.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.520]   It resonates with me, too, Tim, your experience,
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.920]   'cause I never loved those be the fastest runner
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.680]   or the fastest swimmer.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.600]   Those kinds of challenges did not,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.800]   they didn't grab me.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.640]   They didn't grab me.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.720]   Like personal challenges sometimes did.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.560]   Could I read all of the books
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.380]   on the third shelf of the library in one summer?
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.760]   Those kinds of challenges.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   - So think about as a student,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.200]   and you can answer for little kid Tim
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.920]   or high school Tim or college Tim.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.560]   As a student, what challenged you?
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   - I was always excited by and challenged by new ideas,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.760]   trying to understand what it meant and how it worked.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.880]   That was always of great interest to me
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.520]   and a real frustration
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.920]   when someone would put something in front of me
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.720]   and I didn't understand it.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.280]   And so then I would work hard to get it
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.220]   because I didn't like not knowing, not understanding.
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.520]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.080]   - But I'd have to be honest
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.880]   that once I understood the idea of the thing,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.600]   all the extra work that came along
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.280]   with mastering a skill set around it,
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.360]   I had no interest in those whatsoever.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.760]   (laughing)
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.640]   So I didn't mind working to understand a new math concept.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.360]   But when you gave me the 25 problems
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.880]   to demonstrate that I understood it,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.540]   that was where the wheels came off for me.
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.720]   (laughing)
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.040]   - So you liked the moment of discovery,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.720]   but the deeper, get better at it,
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.840]   you could just leave for another day, happily, huh?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.560]   - Yeah, sadly, sometimes I think my,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.620]   what I've received in my greatest challenge
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.160]   was how to do the least amount of that extra work
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.240]   as possible to still do well in my classes.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640]   - This is so funny.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.680]   My husband tells stories like that.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.520]   And I remember cringing
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.120]   when he would tell our daughters that
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.360]   as they were growing up.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   It's like, okay, don't be like daddy.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.200]   Don't do that.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.920]   Don't figure it out.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   Don't let the light dawn on you and then think,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.120]   okay, the fun part is over.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.280]   I opt out of the rest of the work.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   So would you say that you respond to challenges
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.720]   with enthusiasm, at least initially?
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.680]   - Yeah, generally, yes.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.240]   There are some where the challenge is put in front of me
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   and I have merely a sense of duty or obligation
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.620]   and therefore approach it
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.200]   in sort of much more sort of business-like approach.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.440]   But if it's something that I've challenged myself to
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.440]   or that I've discovered as a challenge,
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.880]   then yeah, I tend to be pretty gung-ho,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.000]   at least about getting started with it.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   The finishing, sometimes yes, sometimes no.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.400]   - Yes, I was gonna ask you, as a grownup,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.960]   how do you react to learning new things?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   This, I will be honest.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.720]   I used to ask this question when I would go
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.360]   and speak at practicums or to small groups of parents.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   And sometimes it came up with parents who were frustrated
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.520]   with their early teenage children
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.920]   who were dragging their feet about doing this hard thing.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.160]   And as I think about it,
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.040]   it did tend to crop up in students
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.160]   who were just entering the challenge years
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.320]   and they were going to be hitting some things
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.600]   for the first time or in new ways.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.480]   And I would have parents who were bemoaning
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.280]   their students' attitudes.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   And so I began to ask the parents,
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   how do you respond as an adult to learning new things?
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.840]   So I'm putting you under the microscope and ask you, Tim.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   - Yeah, it depends a lot on whether it's something
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   that I'm looking forward to or not.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.520]   If I want to learn about it or if someone who I trust
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:43.080]   or has inspired me in some way has presented it to me,
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.800]   then I'm usually enthusiastic about it.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.800]   But if it's sort of yet another thing
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.680]   that I look at as a roadblock or again,
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   sort of an obligation, like, oh, well,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.000]   there's another thing I have to learn how to do.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.320]   - Yes, right.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.520]   - Then it may either never become a joy
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   or it may take just some time before it finally,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   I see that there's something valuable or beautiful
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.200]   about it in its own right.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:25.000]   - You know, I think it is a good reminder to all of us
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.880]   and parents, I'm looking at you.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.320]   I had the same revelation with my own children.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.040]   I think it's a good thing for us to stop and consider,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:42.000]   how do I and how does my child react to something new,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.760]   learning something new or facing a new challenge?
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   It will help you understand how to help your student,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.240]   how to help yourself, what kind of self-talk
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.640]   you need to produce or what kind of counsel
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.800]   and mentoring you need to give your student.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.760]   For instance, do you or does your student react
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.440]   to new things with fear?
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.360]   Are they afraid of making a mistake?
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.280]   Do they react to new things that they don't know
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.840]   how to do with denial?
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   I'm not gonna do that because I don't know
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.760]   if I'm gonna be good at it or not.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.160]   I'm just gonna avoid it.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   Do they jump in with both feet with so much enthusiasm
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.640]   that sometimes they don't consider the initial steps
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.200]   that ought to be taken so that success will ensue?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.920]   I think it behooves us to think about that on the front end
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.440]   so that we can help ourselves and our students
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.560]   approach learning new things more successfully.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.120]   - That's good, Lisa.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.920]   Introducing the new thing in a way
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.360]   that sets the student up for success, right?
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.680]   So that they're not either intimidated by it
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.480]   or think too lightly of it, either one.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.200]   It's easier, I think you were mentioning
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.440]   how you felt like as a parent,
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.960]   you would have those moments of frustration
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   with your students.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.200]   And I wonder if it's because we look back on it
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.840]   and we think, "Oh, I can see it for what it is,"
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.320]   but they're looking forward at it
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   and they don't know what we know.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.680]   And so they haven't yet figured out that it's valuable
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.840]   or how hard is it really gonna be?
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.400]   - Yep, that is really, it is really valuable.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.200]   I have a real heart for helping parents
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.720]   reclaim the homeschooling journey
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.760]   as one of family relationships
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.080]   and not just the homeschooling journey
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.600]   as the acquisition of lots of knowledge for your student.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.920]   And so any ways that we can mentor our students
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.680]   and have them, newsflash, mentor us
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.040]   as we learn together as a family,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.320]   not just about our subjects, but about ourselves,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.840]   about our family, about the world, about the Lord,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.800]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.920]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   But we have come today to talk about
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.320]   the challenge of the Challenge Program.
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   And so, because moving into the Challenge Program
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.360]   from the world of foundations and essentials
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.320]   is a really big change.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.520]   It's a change in a lot of ways for students
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.160]   and for the families of those students.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.280]   And this time of change is really reflected
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   in spiritual growth, emotional, social, and physical growth.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.720]   There are a lot of new things to learn
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.520]   as you transition into the challenge years.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.320]   And Tim, I know as a dad,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.240]   you have transitioned students into the challenge years.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.560]   I mean, you're not just a curriculum developer.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.760]   You are also a dad who is shepherding young souls.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.040]   So what stands out to you about that shift
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.320]   into the challenge years?
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.680]   - Yeah, you're right that it's multi-layered.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.640]   It's multi-dimensioned.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.560]   And it's not one size fits all.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.120]   Every student has their own ways
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.000]   that they're gonna grow more quickly
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.840]   or in a particular way than a different student.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.120]   We see it physically most easily, right?
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   Some of those girls, they're 12,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.160]   they suddenly hit that growth spurt
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.680]   and man, they just take off
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.120]   and they're towering over their classmates all of a sudden.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.360]   Whereas more often the boys are still stuck
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.080]   in sort of their halfling phase.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.680]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.920]   - Haven't quite hit that early teen growth spurt
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.520]   as early, but it will come.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.040]   So we see it physically, but it happens emotionally
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.440]   and intellectually and spiritually differently
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.080]   for everybody too.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   Some kids, they hit that prep for challenge A
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   and they are excited and they're looking forward
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.680]   to the extra work and the added responsibility
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   and the day, the whole day away from mom, perhaps.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.480]   That's just, they're on the fast track
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.880]   in their own mind to adulthood.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.760]   And others, they're still very much wanting
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.800]   to be snuggled up reading the Echoes books
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.840]   with mom on the couch for as long as possible
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.120]   and don't really wanna have anything to do
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.320]   with going out and doing something different
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.880]   than what they've known.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   So that transition, yeah, it requires gentleness
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:16.360]   and encouragement, right?
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.960]   To see where the strengths are that you can encourage
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.360]   and to see where the weaknesses or the worries are
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.360]   that you can assuage them and build confidence
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.920]   ahead of time so that that student
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.480]   who has those nervous fears about their peers
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.120]   and the way that they're gonna be treated
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.160]   or that there's this new thing, Latin,
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.280]   that they're gonna encounter.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.000]   And I don't know how to do that,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.080]   but you can prepare them in ways that are more important
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.640]   than doing some kind of an academic bootcamp
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.760]   the summer before a challenge starts.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.320]   - Yes, I like that.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.440]   So what are some of the things that you think?
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.640]   'Cause I can feel some of our listeners thinking,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.240]   "Okay, I know it's gonna be different.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.480]   "I'm gonna have to transition my student
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   "to taking mentoring and instruction
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.760]   "from somebody besides just mom or dad
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.200]   "because my challenge kiddos are gonna be
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.160]   "with this tutor, with this director
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.680]   "for six hours, one day a week.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.320]   "And they're gonna need to learn
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.720]   "how to follow somebody else's directions.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.520]   "And I really need them to know
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.560]   "how to write down their assignments
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.920]   "and schedule out their days."
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.440]   Which by the way, parents, almost every kid
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.760]   is really bad at before they get good at.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.320]   Making their own schedule is a huge step.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.400]   But what I hear you saying, Tim,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   is that there are some really more intangible ways
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.040]   that we as parents can prepare our students
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.520]   for this adjustment.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.120]   - Yeah, I think it's easy for us
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   to impose our view of ourselves onto our students,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:14.480]   what our fears are, what our fears are for them.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.400]   And we put those on the student.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   So we think, well, I'm afraid that they won't do well
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.360]   with having their own schedule and keeping to it.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.320]   But that might not be the student's worry at all.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.120]   Our children, the child might think,
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.720]   "Oh, no, this is great, I've got no trouble with that."
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   - Right, right.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   Whether or not that's true, that might not be their worry.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.880]   Or it might be that actually what we're doing
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.360]   is we're worried that we're the ones
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.120]   that are gonna have a hard time keeping up
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.280]   with that challenge A student.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.040]   And so we sort of secondhand worry on their behalf
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.520]   when really it's our worry, it's our fear.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.520]   So I think we're talking about that challenge preparation.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.160]   I think being prepared for yourself as a parent
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.320]   to allow the transition to take time
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.360]   and some unusual dimensions and turns and directions
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.200]   that you're not expecting is also very important.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.280]   That we don't think that we,
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.400]   because we're the parent or the teacher
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.120]   or older and wiser have all the answers
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.880]   that we can make it perfect for our child because we can't.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.600]   But what we can do is walk along with them through it
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.320]   and help them see where they can do better
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.960]   and where we can do better with them.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.640]   - I like that, I like that.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.280]   And that requires conversation
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   and a lot of, and sometimes quietness
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.320]   where we just have to sit with the student
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.960]   and talk about what are you looking forward to
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.120]   in this new year?
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.120]   What do you think is going to be your favorite part?
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.600]   Is there anything that you know you want help with
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.920]   at the beginning?
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.200]   What are you excited to try?
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Those kinds of questions open up really great conversations.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.680]   What are some of the challenges
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.120]   that you have seen for students?
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.040]   Either your own kids, not calling them out by name
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.680]   or students that you've tutored
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.480]   'cause I know that you have served
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.320]   as challenge tutor before as well.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.320]   So what are some of the biggest challenges
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   that you've seen for students moving into challenge?
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.600]   - Yeah, I mean, students will,
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.800]   different students will struggle
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.560]   with different content areas
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.280]   and that's to be expected, right?
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.680]   Some will thrive in math and others will struggle
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.920]   and some will thrive in reading the literature
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.920]   and others will sort of plod their way through it
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.240]   and that's okay.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.040]   - Yes, it is.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.880]   - And making sure that they know that is an important step.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.880]   But I think that the biggest challenge of challenge
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.640]   for both parent and student
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.960]   is the fact that students are really on a journey
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.200]   toward becoming mature.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.040]   And as a parent, we have a hard time
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.920]   both letting our student become mature at times
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.760]   and also sometimes knowing how best to help them
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.880]   on that path.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.280]   And for students, they too have a hard time
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.880]   because they think that they've arrived in some areas.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.960]   The student who is like,
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.240]   "I don't need your help with Latin, I got it."
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.200]   And you're like, "Oh, good, that's wonderful."
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.280]   But then you go and after a week or so,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.760]   you look at all the Latin they've done for the last week
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.000]   and you're like, "This is a bunch of nonsense
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.760]   "that you've done here."
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.600]   - Right.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.560]   - "I don't think 'gada' means what you think it means."
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.560]   So, and then you end up with usually some soul-searching
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:28.680]   and a little bit of attitude wrangling on both sides
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.000]   that you have to work out where did the problem come
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.760]   and when should it have been addressed
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.000]   and should they have come to you?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.880]   Should you have gone to them?
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.760]   Do you need to check their work every day
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.560]   or can once a week be an okay check-in?
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.880]   Those negotiations are super uncomfortable
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.080]   for parent and student.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:21:00.320]   But that's what growing toward maturity really looks like.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.280]   It's not just some system.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.200]   There's not a method that says if you,
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.320]   in challenge A, you check in daily
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.440]   and then in challenge B, you check every other day.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.840]   And then it doesn't work that way.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.040]   Sometimes you have to check once a week for this semester
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.800]   and next semester you find out you gotta check every day.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.800]   - Or for this subject strand or for this assignment, yes.
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.120]   - So to me, the big struggle is it's managing
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.560]   helping students to learn to manage themself,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.760]   to be self-controlled, to be self-aware.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.640]   And frankly, as adults,
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   we're often not too great at that either.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.720]   - Yeah, I was gonna say, man, that's a continuing struggle
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.280]   when it's the blind leading the blind some days.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.560]   - It is, but we need to walk it along with them
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   and be humble as we admit that these are things
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.240]   that we still work on too.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.760]   - And you know, that actually teaches a better lesson
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.240]   than any they'll ever get from a book
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.880]   because this is a living, breathing human person
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.280]   that they're living with and watching.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   And when they see us extend grace to ourselves
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.040]   and to others within the family,
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   they learn what it's like to receive and extend grace
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.880]   and to be merciful and to be patient with yourself
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   and to see maturity as a journey, not as,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.400]   you know, it's not like "I Dream of Jeannie"
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.800]   where you could just immediately blink your eyes
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.960]   and pop to a whole new place.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.800]   I'm going to go from immature to perfectly mature
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.320]   in one blink of the eye or one shake of the head.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.720]   No, it is a journey and you get better and then you regress
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.640]   and then you go a little farther and then you regress.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.000]   And it's a growth, it's growth.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.960]   I think that's the challenge of challenge
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.640]   is that our students are entering a new period of growth
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:18.600]   but it doesn't signify arrival, hardly at any point.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.880]   - Yeah, it's constant, right?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.760]   It's constant growth at different rates,
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.680]   but constant growth.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.160]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   So give some, I want you to think of your own experience
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.560]   both as a parent and as a tutor.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.760]   What are some ways that we as parents
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.240]   can help our students adjust
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.040]   sometimes to the more mundane changes
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.280]   like that there are external due dates
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.960]   that mom doesn't necessarily set all of them
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.920]   because you do need to finish reading this book
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.000]   before community day
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.800]   in order to participate in the conversation.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.400]   So what are some ways that we as parents
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.880]   can help our students adjust maybe to the workload,
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.000]   maybe to different kinds of responsibilities, whatever?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.640]   - Yeah, that's a topic we could talk about for a long time.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.560]   - For a long time, I was going to say this will not,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.560]   I was going to give the disclaimer of
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.800]   this will not be an exhaustive list.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:32.640]   - Yeah, no, one of the things that first comes to my mind
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.880]   is St. Augustine talked about the Christian life
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:44.680]   has a constant pursuit of ordering our loves
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.880]   to make sure that first things are first.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.880]   And as adults, we should have a better perspective on life
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.520]   than our students.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.400]   They're young, they haven't lived enough yet.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.800]   They haven't had enough experiences or heard enough
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.480]   or been through the hard times
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   to come through the other side the way that we have.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.120]   And so we should be constantly helping them to assess
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.000]   what is of first importance
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.080]   so that those things can be done,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.560]   so those things can be tackled first and done best.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.760]   And then the things that fall farther and farther down
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.920]   that list of less important,
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.560]   those are the things that you learn to say,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.960]   I can't get to that, or I'll do enough of that,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.560]   but I need to give my energy somewhere else.
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.240]   As Christian homeschooling parents,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:51.120]   our church and our Christian faith and our walk
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.320]   has to be the top of that pile.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   And so if we don't help our students to see
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:08.120]   that church attendance and loving your neighbor
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:14.240]   and spending time in the word of God and prayer,
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.640]   if we don't show them that those things are important,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.120]   but instead demand of them academic work all the time,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.720]   we're training them toward a life
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.160]   that's disordered in its loves.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   If you mentioned reading the book
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.520]   in time to have the community conversation,
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.800]   that may not be where the student wants to spend their time.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.120]   They may really love their math studies
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   and really wanna do all the math problems
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.480]   because it brings them joy
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.840]   and they feel like they're good at it.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.280]   And they don't wanna read the book
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.360]   and they'll use the math as an excuse
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.880]   to not get the book read.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.920]   And there's nothing wrong with doing the math,
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.240]   it's a good thing.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.280]   But if they're giving all their energy there
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.360]   and none of it is the thing that's gonna love their neighbor
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.720]   by being prepared for the conversation community,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.080]   we've let them err, we've let them be foolish in that.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.280]   So again, it's a question of wisdom,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.440]   which is always a really hard thing.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.640]   That's hard for us as parents.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.680]   It's hard for them,
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:23.360]   but to walk through this process with them in it
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.080]   is the training ground for them to grow in that wisdom
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.040]   by seeing how we approach those choices,
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.920]   how we help them approach those choices.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.240]   And then ultimately,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.400]   when they start making more of the choices on their own,
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.280]   how we help them to assess the choices
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.880]   that they've already made
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.240]   and to learn from where they erred.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.040]   - That's really good.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.960]   What I'm sensing from you
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   is that one of your best tips for parents
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.240]   would be a constant conversation with your student
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   about family, well, about sharing family expectations.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.440]   What's important to our family?
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.120]   What do I, as your parent,
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.360]   think is the most important thing for our family to do?
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   Maybe it's not do 40 pages of Latin translation.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.880]   Maybe it is, like you said,
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.680]   spending time with the Lord,
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.160]   supporting our family mission,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.200]   loving our church and community,
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.520]   and loving our neighbor while we do the assignments
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.480]   that are set out for us for the week.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.960]   I love the whole idea of, as parents,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.240]   we are mentoring and growing these children
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   to be better humans, virtuous humans who love God.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.400]   We're not raising students, right?
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.000]   We're not raising students.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.360]   We don't want our children to grow up necessarily
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   to be lifelong students,
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.600]   but we do want our children to grow up
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:15.160]   to be lovers of God and lovers of the church
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.120]   and lovers of their family and their community.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.160]   - Yeah, and those are really the lifelong skills, right?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.000]   - Yes.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.960]   - The challenge years are,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.640]   they're the practice gym, right?
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   The training gym for life,
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.920]   and there's a lot in them, like the challenge years
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.760]   have a lot of different things,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.240]   but all of them are like different equipment for training.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.880]   No one of those strands is the most important strand.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.440]   No one of those strands can teach you
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.600]   everything you need to know.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.680]   They all work together in different ways
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.200]   to help you to learn and grow.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.600]   - But no one of them is all of it.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   - Right, so I'm picking up on what you just said.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.120]   So none of the strands is the most important strand.
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.120]   And what I feel like you're saying
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.840]   is that the academic stuff,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.360]   just knowing how to graph a line
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.720]   or balance a chemical equation
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.160]   or write a refutation in a paper,
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.600]   those things are not the most important.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:38.120]   So what are the important life skills
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.160]   that we hope our students are learning
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   as they practice on this great content?
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.000]   - So,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.720]   I was, we're in the middle of the Olympics right now, right?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.680]   - Yes, and I am loving it, yes.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   - Yeah, and I, you know, I would love in some sense
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.120]   to have the time to watch all of the--
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.960]   - I know.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.280]   - All the events and of course you can't,
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:09.560]   though these days they make it amazingly available.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.480]   But I heard a comment
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.200]   during one of the track and field events just this week
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.160]   where the commentator is pointing out
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.640]   that it wasn't too long ago
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.360]   that the best sprinters
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.960]   would also have been the athletes
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.640]   that would have dominated events like the hurdles
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.240]   and the long jump.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.600]   And he was saying these days you rarely see
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.920]   these sort of multi-discipline athletes at the Olympics.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.320]   And he said part of that is the fact
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.360]   that the level of competition
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.040]   has just ratcheted up to be so high
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.280]   that you have to sort of be a specialist
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.240]   at whatever it is that you do.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.760]   But there was something in what he said
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.320]   that really resonated with me
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   that the core sort of competencies,
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.760]   the most important things about being a sprinter
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.320]   or a high jumper or a long jumper or a hurdle runner
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.480]   are all really the same things.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.440]   That there's strength and endurance
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.280]   and agility and quickness
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.480]   and flexibility.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.600]   And that ultimately the little differences between them
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.440]   that are timing your paces to get over the hurdle
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.760]   or lifting your body high up off the ground
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.440]   and twisting to get over the bar,
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.560]   those are sort of micro skills
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:52.840]   compared to the macro skills
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.640]   that are being in control of your body
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.960]   and being strong the way
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.800]   that the track and field athlete has to be.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.600]   And so as I was thinking about that
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.240]   and this discussion that we're gonna have today,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.480]   I think that the strands for challenge
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.440]   they're like that allegory I was just sharing,
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.080]   like the gym,
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.560]   that you go and you work out
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.280]   and you work out different parts of your body
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   at different exercise stations.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.840]   But ultimately the goal is not that you have strong biceps
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.440]   or that you have strong quadriceps,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.040]   but it's that your body is fit,
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.080]   that you're an all around strong,
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.760]   flexible, fast athlete
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.320]   if you're that kind of an Olympic athlete.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.640]   For us, looking at challenge,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.080]   we're looking at it saying,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.440]   well, we don't practice math
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.320]   just so we can be good mathematicians.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.600]   We practice math because it helps us think
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.080]   about the world around us in some particular ways.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.040]   It helps us to hone some certain kinds of thinking
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.960]   that make us better thinkers about all kinds of things
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.600]   and not just numbers.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.400]   We read good books,
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.360]   not just because we need to be good readers,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.920]   though that's a good thing on its own.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.120]   We read those good books
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.600]   because they give us a broad perspective
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.920]   and access to knowledge from past generations
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.160]   and places that we've never been and may never go
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.040]   from the inside of people's heads
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.560]   that we can't otherwise get to.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.080]   And as we think about that,
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   we learn empathy and moral imagination.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.200]   And there's things in there
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.000]   that we can't learn from mathematics.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   And so all of them together work to strengthen us,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.400]   to not make us just a good sprinter or a good high jumper
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.920]   or a good mathematician or a good essay writer,
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   but they make us a whole person, a whole thinker,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.880]   a whole experiencer of life
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.680]   who can make connections quickly
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.400]   between all the things that they're experiencing
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.600]   'cause we live in a whole, we live in a cosmos
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   that that's one reality that we're encountering
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.200]   in various and different ways.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.720]   - Wow, I love this so very much.
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.760]   And parents, if you came thinking
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.640]   that this was gonna be how to set your student's schedule
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.440]   or what books to buy for the different challenge level,
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.880]   I want you to know there are places to find that.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.560]   You can look in the bookstore,
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.560]   you can talk to your product sales specialist
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.160]   or to your challenge director,
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.360]   and they will make sure that you know all of the resources.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.560]   And guess what?
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.800]   You have got experienced parents in your community
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.000]   that will love to talk to you about 30 different ways
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   to make a challenge student's schedule work for your family.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.600]   But what Tim has offered us today is a real perspective
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   on the challenge of the challenge program.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.760]   The fact that the real big challenge
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.720]   is that we are leading these young people
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:36.720]   to become mature humans who can manage themselves,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:42.800]   who are self-aware and who are developing self-control,
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:48.240]   who are learning to be empathetic
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.740]   and to recognize and exercise their moral imagination,
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.480]   to hone the skills of precision
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   and recognition of big ideas and connector of big ideas.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:07.800]   And that's the real challenge of challenge,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:13.720]   to realize that it's a journey of discovery
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   and maturing that we are taking with our students.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.880]   I just really appreciate your thoughts, Tim.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.520]   - That's a really important one is the community piece.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.120]   We've spent a lot of time talking about the academics of it
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.080]   and parent and student,
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.640]   but navigating life in community,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:41.040]   that takes a degree of maturity far beyond
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.760]   just managing the academics.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:49.560]   Any of us who have been in churches where there was trouble
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   or been at the family dinner table around Thanksgiving time,
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.600]   we know that there are fraught relationships
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   and there are right ways and wrong ways to deal with people
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.760]   and our children need our help
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.000]   in learning to navigate conflict.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   And when that girl is mean or that boy is rough
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   or that kid comes in unprepared and he's on my debate team
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.240]   or that one always likes to show off and talk all the time
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.840]   and won't shut up, what do I do?
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:36.760]   That piece of community can be the most frustrating part
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.520]   and maybe leads more people to throw their hands up
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.240]   about loving their neighbor than anything else.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.400]   But how we walk with our children
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.400]   through dealing with difficult social relationships,
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.000]   social settings, I mean, you look at the world around us
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.760]   today and we desperately need that as a society,
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.680]   people who can bear with other people
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.480]   who they have disagreements with
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   or find even someone that you don't wanna be with,
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   but you need to like a neighbor, right?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.440]   But to help our students grow through those means,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.160]   bearing with those struggles in community
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.200]   and not just giving up on it the first time
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.160]   that things get hard any more than we give up
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   on challenge A because Latin seems insurmountable this year
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.920]   or on challenge B because mock trial or whatever,
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.280]   those struggles are, don't give up,
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:50.320]   the lesson that we teach them when we give up on things
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   is maybe a more powerful and worse lesson
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:02.760]   than when we let them fail at some academics
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.120]   from time to time.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:09.480]   - Very wise, I appreciate those words.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.280]   I really do, I think this is great.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.720]   Thank you for sharing with us today.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.680]   Parents, I hope that this is helping you wrap your mind
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.200]   around preparing for the challenge years
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.320]   and for the community year that's now at hand.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.240]   I know you probably are looking for things like notebooks
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.720]   and backpacks and books, and those are good things too.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.600]   And Tim, you can actually speak to this.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.840]   One thing that I wanted to mention to our families
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.360]   as they look for the resources, the books
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.400]   that they're gonna need
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.920]   for their different challenge classes this year,
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.040]   we have the Copper Lodge Library,
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   which is Classical Conversations multimedia imprint.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.060]   It's a book series that preserves and presents
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.400]   all these timeless stories from the past.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.800]   And a lot of these are books that are used
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:10.320]   in your students' challenge exposition strand.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:14.200]   We've got new to the Copper Lodge Library this year,
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.320]   Pride and Prejudice, The Secret Garden,
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.640]   and English Epic Poetry.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.080]   Tim, you work with the content developers
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.520]   who put some of these Copper Lodge Library titles together.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.840]   What's so great about them?
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   Why should families look at Copper Lodge Library
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.560]   instead of some used bookstore to find some of these books?
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.360]   - So as classical Christian educators,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.560]   we believe in the true, the good, and the beautiful,
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.840]   and these books are really all three things.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   They point us with introductions and forwards
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.780]   and footnotes toward true ways to understand the text
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:54.480]   when we need some help.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.000]   They're beautiful additions.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.360]   Our designers have done a wonderful job
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.920]   putting them together and putting clothes on the words
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.840]   that make them so attractive to us.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.720]   And they're just good.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.440]   They're good for, they're useful to us.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.400]   It's great when our students have all the same versions
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.160]   and community so that they can literally
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.000]   be on the same page together
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.240]   instead of scrambling, looking for,
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.120]   wait, what page is that in your version?
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.040]   Where's that in mine?
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.320]   I can't find where we are.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.160]   - Yeah.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.880]   That's really good.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.720]   That's really good.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.060]   So you guys go and look for these
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.040]   if you are interested in just finding out
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.360]   more about Copper Lodge Library
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.560]   and what other titles are available,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.960]   you can go
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.160]   to
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.000]   copperlodgelibrary.com
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.120]   and find more about this.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.240]   Also, you can find out about Copper Lodge Library selections
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.800]   on our bookstore site.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.280]   So you guys go, prepare,
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.380]   and we will pray that the Lord brings you the best year ever
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   as you and your students meet the challenge of challenge.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.420]   Thanks, Tim.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.100]   I appreciate you being here.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.380]   Listeners, I'll see you next time.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.660]   All right?
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:14.500]   Bye-bye.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.840]   (gentle music)
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.900]   you
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.960]   you
