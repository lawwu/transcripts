[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.880]   My name is Andrew Huberman
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.920]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.120]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.400]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.400]   to bring you zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.280]   about science and science-related tools.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.440]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.400]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.960]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.260]   InsideTracker analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.160]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.600]   and health and health needs.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.160]   I've been getting my blood tested for many years now
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.240]   because it just turns out that many of the things
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.940]   that are important to our health and wellbeing
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.720]   can only be detected in a blood test or a DNA test.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.900]   InsideTracker makes that really easy.
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.720]   They can come to your house to take those samples
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.840]   if you like, or you can go to a nearby clinic as well.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.880]   The major problem with most blood tests and DNA tests
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.460]   is that it's very hard to make sense
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.720]   of the information you get.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.280]   You get a lot of numbers related to metabolic factors,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.180]   endocrine factors, et cetera.
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.920]   InsideTracker makes it very easy to decipher
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.840]   what those levels in your blood and DNA mean
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.560]   and what to do about them.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.560]   They have a very easy to use dashboard
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.600]   that if you go to it, it can inform about lifestyle choices
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.720]   such as adding or subtracting certain forms of exercise
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.200]   or nutrition, other things relate to supplementation.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.140]   It's a really powerful and easy to use program.
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.320]   If you wanna try InsideTracker,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.500]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.960]   and put Huberman at checkout
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.680]   to get 25% off any of their programs.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.400]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.920]   and put Huberman at checkout.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.880]   The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.640]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.280]   probiotic drink.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.320]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.920]   and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.520]   I started using Athletic Greens
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.720]   and I still use Athletic Greens
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.360]   because I find it very complicated and almost dizzying
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.620]   to figure out which vitamins and minerals I need to take
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.540]   in order to just cover my nutritional basis.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.840]   Taking Athletic Greens makes that very easy.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.220]   It also tastes very good.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.880]   I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   and I really like it, so I drink it once or twice a day.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.940]   The probiotics that are in Athletic Greens
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.480]   are also important to me
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.440]   because there are a lot of data now showing
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.080]   that the gut microbiome, which is supported by probiotics,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.600]   is important for things like the gut brain access,
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.540]   mood, endocrine factors, metabolism,
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.600]   many, many biological functions.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.260]   And so by taking Athletic Greens,
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.280]   I get the vitamins, the minerals and the probiotics
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.380]   all in one easy to consume, great tasting drink.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.920]   If you wanna try Athletic Greens,
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.120]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.000]   And if you do that,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   you'll also get a one-year supply of liquid vitamin D3K2.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.040]   There are a lot of data now as well
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.400]   showing that vitamin D3 is important for immune function,
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.460]   for mood, endocrine factors,
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.680]   as well as other systems in the brain and body.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.020]   That's athleticgreens.com/huberman.
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.620]   And I should also mention, if you do that,
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.520]   you won't just get the vitamin D3K2, your supply,
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.680]   you'll also get five free travel packs of Athletic Greens.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.500]   Mixing up powders when one is on the road,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.800]   either in the car or in a hotel or on the plane, et cetera,
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.640]   can be kind of messy.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   These little travel packs make it really clean and easy.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.280]   So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.640]   you'll get the special offer of your Athletic Greens,
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.220]   but you'll also get the year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.440]   and the five free travel packs.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.460]   The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.320]   Made For is a behavioral science company
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.860]   that makes attaining positive changes and growth mindset
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.080]   easy through a simple set of steps and a monthly program.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.000]   The company was founded by former Navy Seal,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.620]   Patrick Dossett and Tom's founder, Blake Mycoskie.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.720]   I'm the head of their scientific advisory board.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.600]   And the other members of the advisory board
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.240]   include people like the director of the Chronobiology Unit
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   at the National Institutes of Mental Health,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.920]   members of Harvard Medical School,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   and many other people who are serious about taking science
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.440]   and developing protocols that can be applied
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.580]   towards positive habits and growth mindset.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.260]   If you want to check out Made For,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.360]   you can go to getmadefor.com.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   And if you purchase any of their products
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.160]   and put Huberman at checkout,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.020]   you'll get 20% off their program.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.100]   In addition to that, we do a monthly Zoom call
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.920]   where the members of Made For get on
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.720]   and Patrick and myself, sometimes Blake as well,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.520]   discuss the Made For program and the personal goals
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.400]   and things that people are trying to achieve
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.240]   with the program.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.320]   So it's a dialogue back and forth on Zoom call once a month.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.280]   Once again, that's getmadefor.com,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.680]   put in Huberman at checkout,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   and you'll be able to get the 20% off
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.960]   as well as access the monthly Zoom calls with us.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.520]   Let's talk about neuroplasticity.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.660]   More specifically, let's talk about
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.840]   how we can optimize our brains.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.540]   Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.760]   of our nervous system that allows it to change itself
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.320]   even in ways that we consciously decide.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.040]   That's an incredible property.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.880]   Our liver can't decide to just change itself.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.680]   Our spleen can't decide to just change itself
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.080]   through conscious thought
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.240]   or through feedback from another person.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.180]   The cells in those tissues can make changes, sure,
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.880]   but it's our nervous system
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.360]   that harbors this incredible ability
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   to direct its own changes in ways that we believe
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.720]   or we're told will serve us better.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.480]   Now, today's a really special episode
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.800]   because while we are going to talk about science,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.560]   and as always, we will delve into mechanism,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.520]   today's episode is really geared toward
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.720]   answering your most common questions
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.440]   about how to leverage neuroplasticity.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.880]   The previous episodes were about focus
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.880]   and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.180]   as well as the last episode,
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.100]   which is what are some of the portals into plasticity
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:04.200]   that relate to movement,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.560]   how behavior can activate plasticity
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.080]   as well as how to activate plasticity for behavior itself,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.920]   how to get better at learning certain movements.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.160]   Today's podcast is really directed
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.960]   toward answering your most common questions
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400]   and the bigger theme
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.240]   of how does one go about optimizing their brain
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.500]   or even think about optimizing the brain?
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.840]   What is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain?
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.360]   In doing so, I'm also going to share
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.600]   some of my typical routines and tools.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.140]   I don't share these because I think that they are
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.860]   the only ones that are available out there.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.980]   Certainly they're not,
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.720]   nor do I share them because I think that everyone
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.000]   should do them just 'cause I do them, certainly not.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.140]   I share them because many of you
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.700]   have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.020]   and so I'll share those with you
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.040]   and you can decide whether or not
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.520]   those protocols are for you or not.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.780]   Everybody's different, but there are some common features
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.980]   of how we are all put together
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.220]   at the level of the nervous system and body
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.220]   that direct us toward particular practices,
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.020]   particular routines that can be especially powerful
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.960]   for neuroplasticity.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.160]   So I wanna open up the discussion today
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.660]   by emphasizing something that's fundamentally important,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.300]   which is that plasticity is not the goal.
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.700]   Plasticity is never the goal.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.640]   Plasticity is simply a state or a capacity
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.600]   for our nervous system to change.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.900]   And so nothing makes me more frustrated perhaps
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.300]   than when I hear, oh, you know, this pill, this potion,
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.320]   this practice, it gives you plasticity.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.520]   Plasticity is just change.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.740]   The real question is what are you trying to change
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.700]   and specifically what end goal are you trying to achieve?
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.500]   Specific end goals might be extremely specific,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.600]   like you want to learn how to speak a particular language
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.840]   or you want to learn a new motor skill
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.060]   or you want to get very good at calculus
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.140]   or you'd like to forget the bad emotions related
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.500]   to a particular human being or experience
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.740]   or it can be more general,
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.260]   like you'd like to be more creative.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.340]   We'll actually talk about creativity today.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.460]   Or you would like to achieve more focus
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.240]   or you'd like to be less stressed.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.740]   So it's very important that you understand that plasticity
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.660]   and achieving plasticity is the first step
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.360]   in what we call optimizing your brain.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.560]   You don't want your brain to be plastic all the time.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.900]   In fact, one of the major questions,
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.320]   one of the major unsolved mysteries of neuroscience
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.280]   is how each and every one of us wakes up every day
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.560]   and knows who we are.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.980]   Why should that be?
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.700]   Well, the brain is plastic.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.060]   It has a capacity to change throughout the lifespan,
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.600]   but it's not so plastic
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.660]   that every night when we go to sleep or in our waking
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.820]   that the connections get reconfigured so much so
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.800]   that we forget who we are or how to walk or how to eat.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.180]   It's a good thing that we don't have
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.140]   such robust plasticity or ongoing plasticity
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.220]   that we have to restructure ourselves each day.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.460]   It's part of what gives our life continuity.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.300]   So remember, plasticity is not and is never the goal.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.520]   The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.820]   and then to direct that plasticity
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.800]   toward particular goals or changes
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.500]   that you would like to achieve.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.400]   And I should just mention, there's no rule that in life
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.420]   you have to leverage this incredible thing
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.540]   called neuroplasticity.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.120]   No one said you had to do that.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.380]   This podcast and this episode is particularly for people
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.020]   who are either happy or unhappy with where they're at
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   with a particular aspect of their life
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.820]   and they want to shift it in some positive way.
[00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.940]   And many of you listening might say,
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.340]   well, wouldn't everyone want to do that?
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.220]   Well, actually there are a certain number of people
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.420]   that are pretty good where they're at
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.120]   and they don't want to change and that's terrific.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.960]   And I tip my hat to them and I think that's wonderful.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.840]   If ever they decide that they want to leverage
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.280]   these plasticity mechanisms,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.100]   they can at any stage throughout the lifespan.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.740]   Let's start by talking about the different systems
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.700]   within the nervous system that are available for plasticity.
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.980]   And in doing so, I'll frame them in the context
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.780]   of what I do on a daily basis, on a weekly basis
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.320]   and on a yearly basis.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.660]   First of all, there are several forms of plasticity.
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.180]   They have names like long-term potentiation,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.260]   long-term depression, which has nothing to do
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.780]   with emotional depression, by the way,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.940]   and things like spike timing dependent plasticity.
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.140]   Those names are used to describe cellular phenomenon,
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.820]   the actual ways that the synapses,
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.060]   the connections between neurons change.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.100]   I'll mention those things and I'll give a little more meat
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.020]   as to what they are as I mentioned them.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.500]   But that's probably not the best way to think
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.580]   about plasticity in terms of optimizing your brain.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.780]   The best way to think about it is in terms of short-term,
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.320]   medium-term and long-term plasticity.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.380]   Short-term plasticity is any kind of shift
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.460]   that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.300]   but that you don't necessarily wanna hold on to forever.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.280]   And I'd say, well, what kinds of things are those?
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.360]   Well, for instance, short-term plasticity might be,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.860]   you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight,
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.420]   you're not feeling particularly alert
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.900]   and you want to use a protocol
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.500]   or you decide to use a protocol,
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.760]   which could be coffee or it could be a certain form
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.640]   of breathing or it could be some other tool
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.260]   to become more alert at a time of day
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.060]   when normally you aren't that alert.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.600]   But your expectation is that when you return home,
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.260]   you will discard with the need to do that at 5.30 AM
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.000]   because you'll be asleep at 5.30 AM.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.260]   So there's short-term plasticity, behavioral plasticity.
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.180]   Then there's medium-term plasticity,
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.180]   which are changes that you might wanna make.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:47.020]   I call this with respect and a little bit of humor
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.260]   or at least my kind of humor.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.260]   I call this the undergraduate pre-med phenomenon.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.820]   For those of you that have worked with pre-meds
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.260]   and have tremendous respect for medical students and pre-meds
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.140]   there is a kind of a stereotype,
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.580]   which I don't necessarily agree with,
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.420]   but the stereotype is that they wanna know
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.060]   what they need to know for sake of the exam,
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.300]   but they don't really wanna know, they just want the A.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.700]   And I don't think that's always true.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.720]   I've worked with a number of different pre-meds
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.000]   over the years and there are many of them
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.900]   that are absolutely passionate about the knowledge itself.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.440]   And they also wanted the A.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.600]   But the pre-med phenomenon as it's discussed
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.280]   among professors and TAs is that you've got these students,
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.700]   they just wanna know what they need to know
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.040]   so they can get the A, right?
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.480]   It's medium-term plasticity.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.880]   They don't actually want it to be embedded
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.360]   in their memory too long
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.240]   or else they would actually care about the information.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.400]   So that's medium-term information.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.140]   And sometimes that's useful, for instance,
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.640]   if you go on vacation to Costa Rica
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   and you don't know your way around Costa Rica,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.020]   you wanna learn the different town and the routes there,
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.040]   but you don't have any intention of going back.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.920]   It's just medium-term.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.160]   You wanna just program it in for sake of your time there
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.780]   and then you wanna discard it.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.360]   Most of the time when we think about
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.740]   or talk about optimizing the brain,
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.120]   we're talking about long-term plasticity.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.840]   We're talking about the kinds of changes
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.680]   that people wanna make
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.640]   so that their brain reflexively works differently.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.880]   This is what a child does
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.720]   when it goes from not knowing how to walk
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   to knowing how to walk.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.080]   It doesn't have to think about it
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.200]   after it learns how to walk, it becomes reflexive.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.500]   Long-term plasticity is almost always the big goal.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.280]   It's I wanna know how to speak that language.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.060]   I wanna be able to do that skill.
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.720]   I wanna be able to feel this way
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.920]   without having to put much work into it.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.280]   And there are tools and protocols
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.600]   that one can do to achieve that.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.080]   And we are going to talk about those.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.020]   We've talked about a few of them in previous episodes,
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.380]   but I will revisit those protocols today.
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.080]   I'm gonna frame all this in the context of the daily life,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.680]   the weekly life, and the yearly life.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.060]   And that's because neural plasticity
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   and optimizing your brain rides on a deeper foundation
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.680]   of this thing that governs plasticity
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.080]   and in fact governs all our life called autonomic arousal,
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.680]   which is that we're asleep for part of the 24 hour cycle
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.360]   and we are awake almost always.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.700]   If we push ourselves and stay awake, we're okay.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.160]   We can do that for a night or two,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.400]   but almost always we are asleep for a portion of it
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.280]   and we are awake for a portion of it.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.800]   I've said it before, but I'll say it again.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.680]   The trigger for plasticity and learning
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.780]   occurs during high focus, high alertness states,
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.580]   not while you're asleep.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.600]   And the focus and alertness are both key
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.660]   because of the neurochemicals associated with those states.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.160]   But the actual rewiring
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.520]   and the reconfiguration of the brain connections
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.640]   happens during non-sleep deep rest,
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.880]   which we'll talk more about as always, and deep sleep.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.160]   So you trigger the change and in sleep you get the change.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.220]   So some of the things that we'll talk about today
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.920]   about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.600]   but around the autonomic arousal system.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.280]   We have this system of neurons in our brain and body
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.860]   that's just incredible that wake us up and make us alert.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.560]   And when we're not accessing that system well,
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.220]   we cannot access plasticity, we cannot optimize our brain.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.180]   Likewise, if we cannot sleep well and we can't rest well,
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.780]   we will not access plasticity and rewire our brain
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.660]   because that's when the actual configuration
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.520]   between the connections occurs.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.260]   So to set this in context, I wake up each day
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.940]   and I'll be totally honest,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.120]   I usually don't feel like bouncing right out of bed.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.820]   I usually don't feel completely rested.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.040]   And that's not because I don't get enough sleep.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.080]   It's probably because I'm not terrific
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.340]   about timing my sleep so well.
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.840]   Now this month isn't about sleep,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.120]   that was the previous month, but I really wanna emphasize
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.960]   a few points.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.020]   I wake up generally more tired and groggy than I would like
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.340]   because I tend to go to sleep too late.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.960]   It's just something that I do.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.920]   I not tend to get up early either because I set an alarm,
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.820]   because I have things to do or because I naturally wake up
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.740]   early because of the light coming in and so forth.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:02.280]   Well, what that tells me is that I'm probably somebody
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.100]   who's natural circadian rhythm.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.320]   You may have heard of chronotypes.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.040]   These are genetically programmed things,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.600]   but chronotype is shorter than 24 hours.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.920]   It means that the cycle of waking and alertness for me
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.780]   is probably shorter than 24 hours,
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.440]   which means that getting some light in the late afternoon
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.860]   will help me shift and make my cycle a little bit longer.
[00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.000]   It will phase delay me.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   If that doesn't make any sense, see a previous episode.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.560]   But what it really means is getting some light
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.220]   in the afternoon will allow me to stay up
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.800]   a little bit later.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.800]   But what it means is that I'm not really matching
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.400]   my hardwired needs of going to bed
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:42.000]   probably at 8.30 or nine and waking up at 4 a.m.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.200]   I tend to go to sleep around 10.30, 11,
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.920]   lately around 11.30 or 12, and then I wake up at six.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.740]   And so of course I'm going to feel groggy.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.900]   So neuroplasticity will allow me to optimize my wakefulness,
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.080]   but I have to do something in order to access that.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   And some of you may already be anticipating
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.800]   what I'm about to say, which is, oh no,
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.680]   he's going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.400]   in the first 30 minutes of the day.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.640]   I am going to tell you to do that,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.400]   but I'm going to also tell you two things
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.780]   that I have not discussed before,
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.200]   which relate to the plasticity
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.680]   between the melanopsin cells, these sunlight detecting,
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.400]   bright light detecting cells in our eye
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.160]   and the circadian clock.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.920]   I've never said this before in this podcast,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.720]   but it turns out that the connections
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.840]   between these melanopsin cells and the circadian clock
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.620]   are plastic throughout the lifespan.
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.260]   There's a massive configuration of the connections there
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.040]   and a cell type called the astrocytes,
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.600]   which are a glial cell,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.080]   are actively removing and reinforcing connections
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.440]   between the eye and that clock every day.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.820]   Now, this is incredible because other aspects of your brain
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.920]   that, for instance, represent you knowing who you are
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.520]   when you wake up in the morning or what your name is,
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.420]   assuming that you're old enough
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.120]   that you've already learned your name,
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.660]   one of the first things kids learn,
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.520]   it's something we rarely ever forget.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.280]   Those connections are changing all the time
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.480]   every 24 hour cycle.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.240]   So there's an opportunity for short-term plasticity.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.000]   So that's why I view sunlight first thing in the day,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.320]   it helps me wake up.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.580]   The other thing that I do is that there's a circuit
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.520]   that exists between the circadian clock and our adrenals
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.700]   that I've talked about before
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.400]   that triggers the release of cortisol
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.600]   first thing in the morning that wakes us up,
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.400]   especially when we view light.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.720]   So if you're groggy in the morning,
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.800]   that's why viewing light is helpful.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.080]   But the interesting thing is if you start viewing light
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.780]   frequently in the morning,
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.980]   then those connections between the melanopsin cells
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.340]   and the circadian clock become primed or potentiated,
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.020]   we would say, they become stronger
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.780]   for the anticipation of light.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.000]   And you naturally start waking up earlier,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.460]   feeling more alert.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.020]   So what this says is, and what I do
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.380]   is I get that regular light
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.780]   because I know that some mornings
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.240]   I'm just not going to feel very alert,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.900]   I'll feel especially tired.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.700]   And I might not be able to access sunlight
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.460]   because it's really overcast or I'm traveling
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.580]   or some other feature, but the system is plastic
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.900]   so it shifted in the right direction.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.380]   Now it will shift back
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.740]   because it's short-term plasticity
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.880]   after about two, three days.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.580]   So you want to try and get the sunlight exposure
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.060]   on a regular basis.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:11.060]   The other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.980]   for the first two hours that I'm awake.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.820]   Now, this can be very painful for people,
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.360]   but earlier we talked about the adenosine system
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.700]   and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.540]   and caffeine suppresses adenosine, it makes us feel alert.
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.740]   But we know that if you ingest caffeine
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.620]   immediately on waking,
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.740]   the signal to the adrenals to release cortisol,
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.060]   which is a healthy release of cortisol
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.060]   and the suppression of adenosine
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.060]   that happens as we come out of sleep
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.180]   and in deep sleep, the suppression of adenosine.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.380]   If you ingest caffeine too early,
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.640]   there's a mechanism by which the adenosine
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.060]   competes for the receptors, et cetera,
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.780]   so that you have a mid-morning crash.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.220]   Because if caffeine, the way it works is if caffeine
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.340]   is occupying the adenosine receptor,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.680]   then the natural endogenous mechanisms
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.740]   for suppressing adenosine
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.860]   are not actually going to have their actions.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.580]   So the brain to adrenal axis is subject to plasticity also.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.280]   And so by delaying caffeine
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.580]   until about two hours after waking,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.340]   I'm able to capture and reinforce to potentiate
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.100]   the neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.260]   and the cortisol release in the adrenals,
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.660]   as well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.600]   so that I can then use the caffeine to get a natural lift
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.740]   in alertness and focus two hours later,
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.940]   as opposed to using it just to wake myself up
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.380]   out of sleepiness.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.860]   So while I'm sure there are some eye rolls out there
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.380]   and some yawns about,
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.580]   "Oh no, it's the sunlight in the morning thing again,"
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.780]   it's a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits,
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.340]   so the short-term plasticity.
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.180]   And the reason for delaying caffeine
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.460]   for the first two hours of the day,
[00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.020]   even if it's painful to do for the first couple of days,
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.380]   is that then you naturally start to wake up
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.760]   more readily in the morning without caffeine
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.840]   because the adenosine is suppressed
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.380]   and you don't have these competing,
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.700]   it's called a competing antagonist
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.040]   for the adenosine receptor.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.480]   So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.060]   Lately, because I wake up very early,
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.540]   I do use a bright light to stimulate alertness.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.300]   It's not actually designed for that purpose,
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.700]   it's just a light board that has about 900 lux.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.180]   And then I delay caffeine.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.820]   Some of you have asked,
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.780]   and again, I'm not saying that anyone has to do this,
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.980]   what exactly do you drink?
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.940]   I'm a big believer in black coffee.
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.500]   I just happen to like black coffee.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.780]   People have asked me about,
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.140]   and I don't wanna name brand names here,
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.620]   about this type of coffee or that type of coffee
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.100]   mixed with these other kinds of things.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.960]   Will that increase focus?
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.900]   You know, I'm gonna talk today a lot
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.260]   about the use of diet and fasting and timing of foods
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.580]   and certain kinds of foods.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.560]   But to be honest, black coffee is just a simple choice
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.880]   that's always worked for me.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.180]   I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.260]   There's plenty of data now showing
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.480]   that even a slight increase in dehydration,
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.340]   meaning just when you're lacking water,
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.260]   can make people have headaches,
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.740]   it can provide some additional photophobia.
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.820]   For those of you that are migraine prone,
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.400]   bright light can trigger migraines.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.640]   That's no surprise to those of you
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.820]   that get headaches and migraines.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.260]   But dehydration can compound the vulnerability
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.320]   to migraine and headache.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.940]   So I drink water, I drink black coffee, or I drink mate,
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.420]   which is just because I have Argentine lineage,
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.780]   which is just a high caffeine drink
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.620]   first thing in the morning.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.060]   But I delay it until two hours after I wake up.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.140]   And that's because I want the circuits
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.700]   between my eye and my circadian clock and my adrenals
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.840]   to be functioning in a particular way
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.220]   so that then later the caffeine is an addition,
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.960]   it adds more alertness.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.280]   Now, this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.540]   Many people who wake up quickly
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.100]   and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.920]   I envy these people,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.060]   they will do just fine by going into a learning bout
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.180]   or taking care of whatever it is
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.140]   that they need to take care of.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.380]   Sometimes that's kind of more mundane tasks
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.980]   like email and whatnot.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.520]   Here's more or less a rule about how the brain functions
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.860]   vis-a-vis focus, learning, and creativity.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.580]   And I'm gonna discuss this much more in future episodes.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.260]   Generally, states of high alertness,
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.060]   when we're very, very alert,
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.360]   are great for strategy implementation,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.780]   when we already know how to do something.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.380]   And it's just simply a matter of plugging
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.100]   the correct elements into the correct boxes.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.900]   Things I've talked before about duration, path, and outcome
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.740]   as the three things that the deliberate conscious brain
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.020]   is trying to figure out in order to perform certain tasks,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.900]   even cognitive tasks.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.100]   This is the sort of thing that we are very good at
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.720]   when we're well-rested and we're focused.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.480]   And our autonomic arousal, or our alertness rather,
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.420]   as it is at a high level.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   If you are somebody who is hitting that alertness
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.580]   phase of your day very early, right after you wake up,
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.220]   that's a great time to move right into things that,
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.760]   at least the research says,
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.660]   you already know, have the strategy
[00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.100]   and you just wanna implement the strategy.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.800]   This is where I fundamentally depart from the idea that,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.420]   oh, you know, you have to do the hardest
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.940]   or most critical tasks throughout the day.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.260]   Sometimes the hardest and most critical tasks
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.480]   are tasks that require creativity.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.600]   And as we'll soon talk about,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.040]   creativity and tasks related to it,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.260]   oftentimes come to us best,
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.220]   or the brain is best at achieving those,
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.380]   when we're in states of calm or even slightly drowsy,
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.060]   which is something that's interesting and we'll get into.
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.960]   But for me, for instance, I get up,
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.220]   I'm not terribly alert first thing.
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.380]   And so I try and just get my brain
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.900]   and my thoughts organized.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.960]   It's not a time for me to be responding
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.980]   in a very linear fashion to emails
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.020]   or carrying out calculations.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.580]   That comes about two hours later.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.740]   And I think many people out there will relate,
[00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.700]   mid-morning is when we tend to,
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.640]   when many people tend to achieve their peak
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.440]   in alertness and focus.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.200]   Now, many times I get the question,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.740]   and this is what I'm about to say is directly related
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.780]   to the hundreds of questions I got about this.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.080]   Should I use background music in order to learn?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.300]   Should I have, you know, construction next door?
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.820]   Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.260]   Is it better to be in complete silence, et cetera?
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.180]   Now this will vary.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.460]   Some people can tolerate their own noise
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.980]   within their head much better than others.
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.540]   Other people find that having some background noise
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.860]   helps cancel that out.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.700]   But there's a simple rule of thumb that one can use
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.860]   because at least my experience is that sometimes
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.540]   background music, background noise is very helpful
[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.140]   for allowing me to focus.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:52.700]   And other times it's very distracting.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.820]   So what actually governs that?
[00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.220]   Well, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.500]   what is at the source of the lack of focus?
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.620]   If our lack of focus is because our autonomic arousal,
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.540]   our alertness is very, very high.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.400]   We had a little too much coffee or if there is such a thing,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.440]   slept a little too long or we're really stressed
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.260]   or really activated and we can't seem to focus.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.900]   In that case, eliminating background noise
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.160]   and really just trying to get silence
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.020]   so that we can quiet some of that autonomic arousal
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.420]   is going to be best for learning and for implementation
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.340]   of things we already know how to do
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.920]   for any kind of focus linear task,
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.840]   which basically learning is a focus linear task
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.960]   is that you're just not necessarily performing it well
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.800]   all the time.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.160]   Last time we talked about making errors.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.620]   So as a rule of thumb, if you're feeling too keyed up,
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.440]   then silence and quiet is going to be helpful.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.240]   In fact, if you're very keyed up,
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.720]   a particular circuit related to the basal ganglia
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   starts getting triggered more easily.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.680]   And this circuit I'm going to talk about in depth,
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.400]   but it's called the go/no-go circuit.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.780]   We have circuits that connect our forebrain
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.220]   to our structure in our brain called the basal ganglia,
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.280]   which is actually a collection of structures.
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.800]   And the forebrain, which is involved in rational thought
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.280]   and thinking and planning and action
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.080]   is always trying to plan what should I do
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.560]   and then implement that action.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.880]   And the basal ganglia are intimately involved
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.700]   in that discussion.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.240]   There's a reciprocal loop of communication
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.400]   between basal ganglia and cortex.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.180]   The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.280]   and the cortex back to the basal ganglia
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.220]   that facilitates go, it facilitates action.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.920]   And the molecule, the neuromodulator dopamine
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.820]   triggers the activation of go.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.320]   It tends to make us want to do more things.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.420]   It tends to make us bias toward action
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.320]   by the way that dopamine binds
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.020]   to something called the D1 receptors,
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.140]   just a particular type of dopamine receptor
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.400]   for those of you that want to know.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.600]   The no-go pathway, the pathway in the basal ganglia
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.940]   and cortex that suppresses action
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.920]   involves dopamine binding to this other receptor
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.840]   called the D2 receptor.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.580]   Now D1, D2 receptors, you can't just consciously decide,
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.200]   oh, I only want my D1 receptors
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.520]   and my D2 receptors to be active.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.440]   You have to think about which sorts of states of mind
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   and body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no-go.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.560]   Now this is critically important
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.920]   because doing focused work, accessing plasticity
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.540]   and learning involve doing certain things
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.700]   and not doing others.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:36.680]   So here's how it works
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.220]   and here's how I apply it on a daily basis.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.260]   Because I tend to be most alert
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.520]   first thing mid morning or so,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.720]   and then I generally will have my caffeine mid morning,
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.540]   my peak of alertness in the early part of the day
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.620]   is occurring for me sometime between 9.30 and 11 a.m.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.660]   That's just me, other people might experience that
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.160]   immediately after rolling out of bed.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.440]   They might be wide awake and ready to go,
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.800]   which case they should be cautious
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.180]   about throwing caffeine into the mix
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.940]   because then it's gonna make them very, very alert.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.540]   There are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal,
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   of alertness that bias us more toward go, no-go or both.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:21.860]   And this relates to a question that I've gotten now
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.960]   hundreds of times from you
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.420]   in the comment section for this podcast,
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.400]   which is, is it better for me to listen to music
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.820]   in the background while I work and learn
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.260]   or should I have complete silence?
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.260]   And the answer is it depends,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.140]   but it doesn't depend randomly on who you are
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.260]   or even necessarily time of day.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:47.160]   It depends on your overall level of autonomic arousal.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.080]   And it depends because autonomic arousal,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.980]   level of alertness biases the extent to which
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   we are more prone to goes, to action or to no-goes,
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.280]   to suppress action.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.880]   And dopamine is this molecule that's swimming around
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.140]   and it's going to bias one or the other responses.
[00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.980]   So here's how it works.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.760]   Let's say I'm very alert.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.400]   Maybe I got a particularly good night's sleep
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.300]   the night before, I had a little too much coffee
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.740]   and I'm gonna sit down to some work.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.500]   The thing to know and what I always tell myself
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   is when I'm very alert, I am very prone to go to action,
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.840]   but I'm also prone to not no-go, right?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.440]   I'm not gonna be very good at suppressing action.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.600]   So those are two different things.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.920]   Being biased toward action and being biased
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.520]   towards suppressing action are two different things, okay?
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.440]   So those are push-pull.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.920]   Toward action, suppress action.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.640]   So when you're very alert,
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.320]   the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.400]   This is why when people say,
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.840]   well, should I just take a drug
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.200]   that will increase my level of epinephrine and alertness,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.200]   will that help me learn better?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.720]   No, because it will make you do things,
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.640]   but it will also make you less good
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.720]   at suppressing actions that you need to suppress.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.120]   So if I'm very alert, particularly alert for me,
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.360]   and I recognize what that state is, of course,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.400]   'cause everyone will be different.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.940]   I know what it is for me.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.640]   Then I want silence for learning.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.960]   I want to shut down my internet, which I do.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.920]   I sometimes use a program
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.580]   that I believe is a free program called Freedom,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.100]   where it actually locks you out of the internet
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.340]   for a particular time.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.540]   They're not a sponsor of the podcast.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.540]   I just happen to use it.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.800]   There's another version of Freedom
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.440]   where you go to the wireless thing and you turn it off.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.760]   You disconnect from the wireless.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   That's the other one,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.140]   although many people have a hard time not reactivating it.
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:39.340]   So I'm trying to shut down the go pathway
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.380]   towards distraction.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.040]   And the other thing that I'll do
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.180]   is I'll generally turn off my phone,
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.620]   put the phone outside in the car,
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:47.980]   or in really extreme cases,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.460]   I'll throw it up on the roof,
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.340]   which is hard for me to retrieve
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.560]   so that I can't get to it.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.000]   So if I'm very alert,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.960]   I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.620]   It will be hard for me to suppress non-action,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.280]   but that it's very non-specific
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.920]   because the next kind of level down of alertness
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.160]   or autonomic arousal is clear, calm, and focused,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.460]   where we have that kind of sweet spot
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.620]   between our willingness to pursue action.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.100]   We're in a mode of go, and it's not always physical action,
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.980]   but it can be pursuing hard bouts of learning,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.380]   but that our ability to suppress is also very good.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.340]   And this is because,
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.120]   and I don't want to get into too many details,
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.260]   because of the way that dopamine competes
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.580]   for these dopamine one receptors in the go pathway
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.020]   and dopamine two receptors in the no-go pathway,
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.080]   they're always in this kind of push-pull.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.500]   And so there is a sweet spot,
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   and that sweet spot isn't flow
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.180]   where it is in some sort of state
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.180]   where all of a sudden things come naturally to us.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.660]   The state that we're trying to achieve
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.860]   that's optimal for learning is one in which
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.180]   we have the energy and focus to pursue,
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.340]   but we also have the energy and focus to suppress action.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.020]   So the basal ganglia are kind of working
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.100]   in a perfect kind of sing-songy manner
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.860]   through this parallel pathway.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.180]   Now, as we get tired,
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.700]   or as we round out an ultradian cycle of about 90 minutes,
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.400]   what happens is our fatigue,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.800]   even if it's not a physical fatigue
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.420]   that makes us want to go to sleep,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.600]   but our mental fatigue starts to accumulate
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.140]   because these pathways of go, no-go
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.100]   are actually very metabolically consuming.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.820]   So what I recognize is that as I start to falter,
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.860]   I have a harder time engaging and going,
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.300]   I also know, or going toward the goal rather,
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   I also know that my reflex toward actions
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.700]   that are unrelated to the learning
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.080]   are also going to start increasing
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.820]   because I'm not going to be able to suppress action
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.380]   and activate the no-go pathway.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.920]   So if this all sounds like a mouthful,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.440]   let's make it very simple for you.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.180]   When you are very alert,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.740]   the best situation for learning is going to be silence.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.140]   It's going to be complete quiet.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.020]   If you are low arousal and you're tired
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:33:59.220]   and you're kind of sleepy,
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.060]   a lot of people find that having some background chatter
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.740]   and some background noise
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.260]   can help elevate their level of autonomic arousal.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.660]   And that's because our auditory system and our visual system
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.420]   are linked and are part of really
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.140]   what's called the salience network,
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.360]   which is that we're always scanning
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.860]   our environment for things.
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.220]   And when we have a lot of things in our environment to scan,
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.700]   generally our level of alertness goes up.
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.740]   This is why environments that are very stark
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.880]   or have very little or very few objects in them
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.700]   tend to make us feel kind of calm
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.940]   because our salience network kind of shuts off.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.080]   A lot of people don't like that.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.380]   They'll go to a meditation retreat
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.880]   or they'll go into an environment
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.220]   where there's very little clutter, especially city people,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.900]   and all of a sudden they start feeling
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.300]   really, really anxious.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.140]   And that's because their internal level
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:45.740]   of autonomic arousal is really high
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:46.980]   and it's not being occupied
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.580]   by all this stuff to pay attention to.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.980]   And so their salience network starts to turn inward.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.080]   They move from exteroception to interoception.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.740]   They're not looking outside themselves.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.820]   They're looking inside themselves
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.780]   and there's a lot of noise in there.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.220]   So as a rule of thumb,
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.720]   if you tend to be kind of on the high level of alertness
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.540]   and kind of anxiety,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.740]   and I'm not talking about clinical levels of anxiety,
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.380]   but you tend to be pretty high energy,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.560]   well then you are definitely going to benefit more
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.200]   in a learning bout from learning to go
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.140]   as well as activate the no-go pathway.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.700]   And that requires a lot of energy.
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.300]   And when you have a lot of distractions in your environment,
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.700]   there's a high probability
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.020]   that you're going to be distracted from the learning.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.360]   Now, some people are just naturally more calm.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.560]   They're like my bulldog Costello, who's exceedingly calm.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.580]   They're pretty mellow.
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.460]   They're kind of clear, calm, and focused all of the time.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:40.980]   And those people actually are going to be less flappable.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   They're not going to be yanked around by background noise
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.100]   or they're not going to be around bothered
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.940]   from their learning or from their studying
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.980]   by a clanging of a pot from somebody in the kitchen.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.020]   So each one of us generally tends to ride up and down
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.500]   this autonomic ladder, so to speak,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   at different times of day.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.920]   For most people, three hours after waking,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.420]   those three hours, not three hours on the mark,
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:05.620]   but that three hour bin,
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.060]   tends to be the period in which
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.520]   they're most alert throughout the day.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.100]   Except I'll tell you later about a unique time
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.020]   right before sleep in which you're also very, very alert,
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.380]   naturally.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.640]   So that morning three hours is quite vital.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.660]   Now, many of you might ask about exercise
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.220]   and when to exercise.
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.380]   I think I may have mentioned this
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.820]   on a previous podcast episode,
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.780]   but the research shows that at least for performance,
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.560]   afternoon exercise might be better
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.140]   in terms of avoiding injury, et cetera.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.340]   But in terms of rising body temperatures,
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:38.620]   and matching body temperature to mental alertness, et cetera,
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.000]   it's pretty clear that exercising early in the day
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.780]   not only biases us towards waking up earlier,
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.220]   but that it also triggers the release of things
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.200]   like epinephrine and other neuromodulators
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.540]   that lend itself to a situation
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.360]   where we have heightened levels of arousal
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.880]   and mental acuity in the late morning
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.540]   and even into the afternoon.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.820]   This can be very good
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.700]   because if you want to restrict most of your focus learning
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.860]   to the early part of the day,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.960]   exercising early in the day does set a neurochemical context
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.680]   or milieu for go.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.620]   It tends to trigger activation of the go pathway.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.380]   And so for those of you like myself,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.940]   who have a hard time kind of engaging
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.780]   and getting into action early in the day,
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.420]   early morning exercise within an hour of waking
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.440]   and certainly no later than three hours after waking
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.860]   will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the day.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.220]   It will make you feel more biased for action.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:32.820]   You won't feel as lethargic.
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:35.840]   So in kind of reviewing what I've said up until now,
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.520]   I do the morning light thing,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.520]   I delay my caffeine two hours after waking
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.900]   and then I generally try and get exercise in the first hour
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.440]   or ideally within the first three hours of waking up
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.980]   and then I'll move into a focused learning bout.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.520]   Now, some of you wrote to me and said,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.780]   if I exercise early in the day,
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.380]   then I feel a crash afterwards.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.420]   If that exercise is very, very intense,
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.060]   so you're depleting all your glycogen,
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.060]   so you're doing heavy deadlifts, et cetera,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.700]   chances are after you eat, you will start to feel a crash.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.800]   So this relates to timing of nutrition
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.180]   and in just as a general rule of thumb,
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.540]   fasted states and low carbohydrate states,
[00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.540]   I'm not talking about a keto diet around the clock
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.600]   or all week, but fasted states
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.300]   and low carbohydrate states lend themselves to alertness
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.740]   and that's because carbohydrates are rich in tryptophan
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.860]   and they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.700]   Of course, ingesting large amounts of any kind of food,
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.260]   any substance that fills your gut will divert blood
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.460]   to your gut, so if you eat a lot of food,
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.300]   regardless of whether or not
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.780]   it's a lot of carbohydrate or not,
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.260]   you're going to generally feel more sleepy.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.200]   Now, many people, including everyone,
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.580]   use food to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:53.220]   and typically eating shifts us more towards a state of calm
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.900]   and fasting shifts us more toward a state of alertness
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.420]   and these are hardwired circuits
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.660]   that relate to the need and desire to find food,
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.480]   which requires action or the so-called rest and digest system
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.960]   which diverts our resources and our energy towards digestion
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.320]   and makes us feel calm.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   So I personally rely on water, mate and black coffee
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.180]   first thing in the day in order to exercise
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:19.140]   and get into the first round of work.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.740]   If I find that I'm too alert
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.760]   and then I generally will tend to eat
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.060]   and kind of bring down my level of alertness
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.460]   and we'll continue working.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.700]   Now, this isn't a strict thing
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.300]   and since people ask me what I do
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.860]   and I'm not dictating that people follow it exactly,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.340]   of course, or even generally,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.580]   but I'll just tell you what I do.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.200]   It is possible if you're drinking black coffee
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.220]   and you're, or mate, and you're ingesting a lot of water
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.340]   that you're going to dehydrate yourself somewhat
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.560]   because of excretion of sodium.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.960]   Provided you don't have hypertension,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.620]   salt is a really good thing.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.120]   A lot of people think that they are low on blood sugar
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.820]   because they're shaky and they can't think
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.620]   or they have a headache when actually they're low in sodium.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.140]   And especially if you're drinking a lot of caffeine.
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.640]   So I'm a big believer in salt.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.800]   So I drink salt water first thing in the morning
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.920]   because I drink black coffee
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.940]   and that keeps my levels of alertness really good.
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.220]   I always thought that I had messed up blood sugar.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.320]   I had shaky hands and I didn't know what was going on.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.660]   I'd drink a little bit of coffee and feel too amped up.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.060]   It turns out that it was a sodium issue.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:19.120]   And if I just drank water with a little bit of sea salt
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.100]   and or even just a general table, typical table salt,
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.860]   then I felt rock solid in terms of my blood sugar.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.660]   Now, again, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.600]   so I don't prescribe anything, but I profess lots of things.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   So I don't want people who have diabetes
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.840]   or blood sugar issues to go off the rails.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.060]   You're responsible for your health, not me.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.320]   But it's an interesting parameter to think about
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.340]   and experiment with provided that your doctor says it's okay
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.440]   because I think a lot of people
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.660]   probably ingest too much sodium
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.400]   but a lot of people might be sodium deficient
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.260]   in particular the people that are fasting.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.940]   I typically eat my first meal right around midday.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.720]   Whether or not I've exercised or not.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.940]   And the food content there is actually quite important to me.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.580]   I don't know why this is.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.060]   I don't have a scientific mechanism for this
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.020]   but if I eat hot food for lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.380]   So I generally don't eat hot food for lunch.
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.220]   I might have a little bit of soup or something like that.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:15.840]   But in general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.060]   I'll eat meat or salad or some variation of that
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.660]   and nuts and fats and things like that
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.960]   because of the choline content for focus
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.460]   because the protein's good in my belief
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.620]   and because I believe in eating fruits and vegetables
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:28.460]   I do that too.
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.820]   If I've exercised very hard early in the day
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.500]   I do ingest starches like oatmeal or rice
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.820]   and fruit and things like that.
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.040]   Now, why am I telling you all this?
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.940]   Because hundreds, if not a thousand people ask me
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.980]   is fasting good for focus?
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.900]   And indeed fasting will increase alertness
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.660]   but if you're so hungry or preoccupied with food
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.880]   that you can't focus,
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.380]   well then it's not gonna be good for learning.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.440]   It's only gonna be good for agitation.
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.460]   Now, I'm just gonna continue to march through my day.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.260]   And this is of course what I experienced.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.740]   Some people are quite different
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.500]   but what I find is around two or 3 p.m.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.540]   I start getting a little groggy, a little bit sleepy.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.020]   I will tend to shift my work
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.340]   from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.500]   really careful analysis and activation of the no-go pathway
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.500]   meaning I'm trying to suppress the impulse
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.900]   to look at my phone or answer email or do other things.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.340]   This is why I haven't emailed you back
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.360]   until three in the afternoon, by the way
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.800]   or responded to your text messages
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.080]   whoever you are out there.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.520]   Around early afternoon
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.500]   I find I can do kind of typical more mundane tasks
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   because those tasks require less cognitive load
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.600]   and they can be done more or less in and out of sequence.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.000]   I can answer a couple of email here
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.500]   maybe answer that email there.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.000]   I don't have to do it in pure linear fashion.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.320]   Any kind of linear work or learning work
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.840]   is going to take a lot of focus.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   And then typically around 4 p.m. or so, I do two things.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.520]   Sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.260]   but I do two things.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.460]   One is I make sure I hydrate
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.500]   because if you're exercising and you're eating
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.700]   you need to digest that food, et cetera.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.680]   I make sure I hydrate so I drink water.
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.200]   I try and refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.400]   This is a new thing for me.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.800]   I sometimes do it, but I try and refrain from that.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   And then I always do a non-sleep deep rest protocol
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.900]   sometime in the afternoon.
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.880]   This is sometimes a 10 minute yoga nidra type protocol
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.720]   or a 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   These are protocols that I have no relationship to
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.560]   no business relationship to whatsoever.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.520]   I've been doing them for years now.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.600]   They involve listening to a script.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.980]   We'll provide the links again
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.560]   although we've provided them before
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.960]   or I'll do a hypnosis protocol from Reverie Health
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.120]   which is my colleague David Spiegel's website
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.440]   that has these free hypnosis apps
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.920]   or scripts that you can listen to.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.540]   And those take me into a state of really deep rest
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.520]   sometimes so much so that I fall asleep.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.600]   And I always set an alarm
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.480]   so that I don't sleep for longer than 90 minutes.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.600]   But typically this goes for about 30 minutes.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.760]   And I do that because for me by about 4.30 in the afternoon
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.280]   I'm capable of doing basically nothing.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.740]   I am just a complete Costello.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.320]   I can't think, I can't do, I can't respond to email.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.440]   I've just completely trough my ability to function.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.960]   I personally find it a mistake to at that point
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.200]   down a double espresso and charge really hard.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.300]   It just doesn't work for me.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.380]   I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.080]   I end up disrupting a lot of different things.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.400]   So for me, I do the non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.200]   It really helps me later when I need to fall asleep.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.320]   It helps with all sorts of things as I mentioned before
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.600]   but I usually emerge from that a little groggy
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.940]   or feeling like I have another whole day second wind.
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.760]   Like I could just work, work, work, work, work.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.400]   And then I'll do a second bout of learning.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.760]   I'll do some sort of work
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.360]   that either involves linear analysis of something.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.680]   So maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.800]   I generally try and really use those bouts
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.920]   of 90 minute focused energy after the non-sleep deep rest.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.480]   And as I mentioned in previous episodes
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.000]   there's a lot of evidence
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.840]   that these non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.120]   can enhance and accelerate plasticity.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.440]   The most, I think, recent and striking one
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.680]   is the study that we referenced last time
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.680]   in the caption notes was the Cell Press article,
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.360]   Cell Reports, great journal was showing
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.960]   that these 20 minute kind of shallow naps
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.000]   and non-sleep deep rest
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.540]   can facilitate sensory motor learning.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:38.920]   So then I'll go into another learning bout
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.280]   that's caffeine free.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   This learning bout is very different than the morning one.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.060]   This is a work bout or learning bout
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.400]   that's more in the clear common focus regime
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.180]   because I've come out of this non-sleep deep rest.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.640]   I'm not ingesting caffeine
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.480]   because I want to make sure
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.960]   that I can sleep later that night really well.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.080]   And this tends to be more when I do creative type work.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.480]   Now, creativity is a topic
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.960]   that we're going to spend the entire month on
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.200]   coming up soon.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.280]   But creativity is a very interesting state of mind
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.920]   in which we're taking existing elements,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.200]   things that we already know
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.840]   and rearranging them in ways that are novel.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.240]   And I'd say, well, duh, that's what creativity is.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.300]   But creativity has two parts.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.020]   It has a creative discovery mode
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.720]   where you're kind of shuffling things around
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.920]   in a very relaxed way
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.960]   and kind of being playful
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.600]   or exploring different configurations.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.880]   And then creativity also has
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.840]   an absolutely linear implementation mode
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.160]   in which you take the idea or the design you've come up with
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.600]   and you create something very robust and concrete.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.460]   And so creativity is really a two-part thing.
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.040]   And the first part
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.880]   of actively exploring different configurations,
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.560]   sometimes in a playful way,
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.200]   sometimes in a way that's almost random
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.320]   and just kind of exploring,
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.320]   that state is definitely facilitated
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:06.200]   by being relaxed and almost sleepy.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.440]   That is not a state that I personally can access
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.680]   very well early in the day.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.560]   I've tried to access it coming out of sleep
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.500]   because one would say,
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.900]   well, you're still sleepy early in the day.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.740]   And it just doesn't work.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.760]   Most of what I write down,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.000]   most of what I do is complete garbage.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.120]   And so what I found is there's this block
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.840]   in the afternoon of about 90 minutes
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.540]   where I can do creative type writing
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:29.360]   or creative type imagination of scientific ideas
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.720]   or experiments we might want to do.
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.560]   Science might not seem like a creative endeavor
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.600]   to many of you, but it is.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.480]   It has a lot of imagining what if this,
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.660]   or we could combine that
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.920]   and thinking of novel concepts or ways of arranging things.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.240]   So when you find yourself
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.480]   in that kind of clear, calm, and focused mode,
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.440]   creative works tend to come about very well
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.980]   in those regimes.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.380]   Now, I know that a lot of people out there
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.940]   rely on substances to access creative states.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.400]   I'm not a marijuana user.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.000]   It's just not the drug for me for a variety of reasons.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.440]   I'm not a drinker.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.560]   It's not the substance for me for a variety of reasons.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.460]   I'm not a cop.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.160]   I'm not out here to tell people what they should do
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.140]   or shouldn't do.
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.740]   The problem with using substances to access creativity
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.860]   is that generally the substances that relax people
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.780]   will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   but not so good at the linear implementation mode.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:28.460]   The other day, I was remarking with a friend
[00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.880]   that there are some ads, some advertisements
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.860]   that I've seen over the years that are just incredible.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:35.780]   I'll just tell you what they are
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:36.940]   so that it's not cryptic or anything.
[00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.980]   I'm revealing my taste here.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.300]   There's a particular perfume ad that Spike Jones made
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.060]   that is just amazing.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.660]   I'll put a link to it 'cause it's just so cool
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.940]   and it's just so, and it has an,
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:49.900]   I don't want to give away the end,
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   but it has a feature of it
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.740]   that is particularly interesting to me as a neuroscientist.
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.340]   And it's just so cool.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.740]   'Cause I grew up in the skateboarding thing,
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.780]   I knew a little bit about Spike's movies and skateboarding,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.220]   and he's, of course, made a lot of very impressive,
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.200]   popular movies as well, full-length features.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.860]   I don't know him personally, so this isn't a plug,
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.340]   not that he needs my endorsement for anything at all.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.760]   But the amazing thing about this advertisement
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.300]   is it's a kind of, it's a collection of things
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.880]   that you would never really think would be combined,
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   and it involves different speeds of motion
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.580]   and all sorts of effects.
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:24.880]   I mean, it's like a real classic,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.960]   like Spike Jones kind of delivery.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.460]   But what's incredible is when you think about
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.840]   not just the fact that someone had to imagine that,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.060]   but to actually implement the steps in order to create that,
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:39.780]   when you see this, you'll realize that was a ton of work.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:41.500]   You can't just put that together randomly.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.400]   And so a lot of people, not Spike, clearly,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   but a lot of people who have an incredible mind for ideas
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.440]   and novel arrangements of things,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.360]   they are great at accessing that state,
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.060]   but not so good at accessing the implementation state.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.900]   And then it's also true that a lot of people,
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.000]   and some who tend to fall on what we would call
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   the kind of like more Asperger's
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.740]   or autism end of the spectrum,
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.140]   are very good at linear implementation.
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.200]   Now, I'm not talking about all forms of autism, of course.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.120]   I'm sensitive to the fact that there are many forms
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.260]   on the spectrum.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.740]   But some people are very good at linear implementation,
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:22.200]   and that's a separate state from a creative state.
[00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.320]   So that afternoon block is when I try and access
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.980]   the freer kind of looser mindset
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.300]   that's associated with the fatigue
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.000]   that comes later in the afternoon.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.140]   And for some of you, that state that favors creativity
[00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.040]   and creative learning might be better in the morning.
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   I don't know.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.700]   You're going to have to decide.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.700]   For some of you, you're going to be late shifted.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.340]   Some of you are going to be morning shifted.
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.740]   But where we have alertness,
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.860]   generally we are good at linear implementation.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.100]   We're good at activating the no-go pathway
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.220]   and suppressing action.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.660]   And we are good at pursuing particular goals
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.820]   and strategy implementation.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.980]   And where we tend to be more relaxed,
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:01.080]   and we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.820]   So for me coming out of one of these non-sleep
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.800]   deep rest modes or sleep,
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.700]   that's when we tend to be better at novel configurations
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.140]   of existing elements, which is creativity.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:15.260]   And this brings about a question that I get all the time,
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.200]   which is what about psychedelics?
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.480]   So I am going to talk to some experts on psychedelics.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.500]   I hope to bring some of them in.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.140]   Actually speaking of people coming in
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.320]   or creatures coming in,
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.200]   a creature that's definitely not on psychedelics
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.220]   who doesn't need any is Costello, and he just arrived.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.760]   He seems to be in a sleepy state most all the time.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   Hey buddy, how you doing?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.980]   You come in?
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:43.580]   Yeah, he's working on his 15th sleep deep rest episode
[00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.300]   of the day, which is generally followed
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.580]   by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episodes,
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.340]   almost exclusively comprised of REM.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.920]   And I know this 'cause his eyes are open
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:54.620]   'cause they're so droopy, he can't close them all away.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.380]   And his eyes are going like this
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:58.120]   and he's going down for the count.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.580]   So yeah, nice and big yawn.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.500]   Okay, so psychedelics.
[00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:06.260]   First of all, I want to be very clear.
[00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.620]   I am neither a proponent nor am I somebody
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.180]   who rejects the potential role of psychedelics.
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.900]   I do, however, think that psychedelics
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.140]   can be particularly hazardous
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:21.260]   for people who have preexisting psychological issues
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.040]   and are not working with a board-certified psychiatrist
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.680]   or physician, as well as for essentially all kids.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.020]   I think that the young brain is basically
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.760]   in its own psychedelic state and just naturally.
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.860]   And all kidding aside, I think that the young brain
[00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:43.060]   is so subject to neuroplasticity that drugs
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:45.860]   which like psychedelics, which are very powerful,
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.220]   can be detrimental to the developing brain.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:49.300]   That's just my stance.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.660]   If anyone disagrees with me,
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.700]   I'd be happy to chat with you about it
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.480]   in a polite and discourse.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.120]   I'll be happy to listen as well as tell you
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.640]   more why I believe that based on the data.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.760]   I'm mentioning psychedelics because many of you asked.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.920]   Here's the deal with psychedelics.
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.820]   At least here's how they work.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.400]   In a nutshell, psychedelics were thought
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.560]   to unleash sensory processing and to make it less filtered.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.300]   We have a lot of different inputs from our eyes,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.200]   from our ears, from our nose, from our taste, et cetera,
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.120]   that are coming in all the time in parallel.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.140]   And we have mechanisms that suppress some of those
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.740]   and allow us to only focus on things
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.120]   that are happening visually.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.880]   Generally, we don't have synesthesia
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.040]   unless some of us happen to have synesthesia.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.460]   We don't blend what we see with what we hear
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.280]   in a way that is confusing to us.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.540]   We know what's making sounds
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:42.660]   and we know what is a visual stimulus.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.220]   On psychedelics, people report being able to smell colors
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.800]   or to hear trees, et cetera.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.860]   And that's because there's a lot of sensory blending.
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.440]   However, that's led to the misconception
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:58.080]   that sensory blending itself is a creative process.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.060]   There's nothing creative about sensory blending.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:05.580]   The essence of a creative process
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.980]   is that some novel configuration of elements,
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.040]   whether or not it's notes on a piano
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.400]   or whether or not it's words on a page,
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.040]   whether or not it's numbers or whether or not it's movement,
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   that some way in which those are configured in some new way
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.040]   that the algorithm, the way in which they are configured
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.260]   makes sense to the observer.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:28.500]   And this is a key thing.
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:29.340]   It seems to me
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.780]   that when people report their psychedelic experiences,
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:34.520]   it makes a lot more sense to the person who experiences it
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.880]   than to the observer.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.260]   And so creative works by definition
[00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.640]   are new ways of configuring things that lend themselves
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.920]   to a bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.820]   on the part of the observer.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.900]   And just sensory blending is not gonna accomplish that.
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.760]   Now, it is true.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.940]   And there's a great review in the journal Cell,
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.260]   excellent journal, about how psychedelics work.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.920]   And it turns out they don't just work
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.840]   by allowing for more sensory blending.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.560]   They do, because of the way that they activate
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.420]   certain serotonin receptors, et cetera,
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.640]   they do lend themselves to more lateral connectivity
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.920]   between different brain areas, more novel associations.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.720]   So in principle, in principle, I should say,
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.020]   not necessarily in practice, but in principle,
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.900]   they do allow different areas of the brain,
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.340]   maybe even the two sides of the brain,
[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.660]   to communicate more broadly than they would normally.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.840]   So that has certain elements that speak to creativity,
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.940]   but it can't simply be the case
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.500]   that psychedelics are the portal to creativity
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.760]   because creativity, as I mentioned before,
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.740]   involves not just novel associations
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.360]   and a breaking of kind of space-time rules.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.380]   It also involves reconfiguring things
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.080]   such that the new space-time rule that one comes up with
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:55.740]   is interesting, stimulating, and kind of, in many cases,
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:58.100]   delightful to the observer.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:03.100]   And that's why many claims that psychedelics open plasticity
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.220]   or they increase creativity,
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.660]   that's not sufficient for me personally.
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:09.720]   I'm curious about,
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.040]   does it not just open the creative thinking process,
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.640]   this novel configuration process,
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.820]   but does it also lend itself
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.020]   to the implementation of creative works?
[00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.220]   And the answer is no.
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.300]   In most cases,
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:25.620]   it has nothing to do with creative implementation.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:29.220]   Now, I think that there may come a time,
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.520]   and certainly there are clinical trials
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.580]   that are happening now,
[00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.940]   where psychedelics are leveraged
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.920]   toward particular clinical goals.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.720]   And I want to tip my hat to the work at Johns Hopkins
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.940]   that's happening now,
[00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:42.480]   which really lends itself to the idea,
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.700]   the early preliminary data
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.140]   and some of the papers that are coming out of there
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.500]   are really fantastic,
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.500]   showing that there may be some excellent roles
[00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.160]   for certain psychedelics in certain clinical contexts.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.940]   These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.400]   that is authorized to do that,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.000]   that can help people through depression, trauma, et cetera.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.580]   And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about that,
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.360]   including with some of those folks running those studies.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.860]   So we can look forward to that.
[00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.440]   So all of this is to say that no,
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.400]   I don't take psychedelics to access creative states.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.840]   That's not where I think the major role,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.280]   the important role of psychedelics might show up
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.720]   if it's going to for humanity.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.460]   I think that it may have these important roles
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.760]   in the clinical context,
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:27.380]   provided it's done legally and safely.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:31.900]   I think that the creative process being a two-stage process
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.900]   means that I am personally best served
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.460]   by having this period of nonlinear exploration of concepts,
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.660]   whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon,
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.960]   but then I'll actually shelve that work.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.140]   I'll just set it aside and then I'll revisit it the next day
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.860]   or even the next day to see whether or not
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:53.500]   that the work itself is ready
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.560]   for deliberate linear implementation,
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.400]   which I would want to do
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.500]   during one of these highly focused states.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.180]   So the long and short way of saying this
[00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.580]   is that when we're very alert,
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.620]   do linear type of operations.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.340]   When we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed,
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:11.100]   that's when creative works can first be conceived,
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.420]   but their implementation requires high levels of alertness.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.320]   Now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.380]   Now I am, as I've mentioned before,
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.100]   I'm a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well.
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:30.420]   This is a critical thing that I have not mentioned before.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.140]   Here's how it works.
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:33.740]   Many people now have heard me say
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.900]   getting light early in the day is important,
[00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:38.680]   but that will advance one's clock.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.520]   It'll make you want to get up earlier the next day.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.020]   By getting light in the evening,
[00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.600]   it accomplishes two things for me.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:47.400]   First of all, it makes sure that I don't get up too early,
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.420]   that I'm not waking up at three or four in the morning
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.120]   because it's going to shift my clock.
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.880]   It's going to delay it a little bit.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.860]   And so this is really important.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.800]   If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.320]   on a regular 24 hour cycle
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.760]   and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:05.940]   drifting all over the place,
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.240]   and you want some predictability
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.760]   to how your mind is going to work
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.020]   in order to optimize learning and performance,
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.300]   well, then you need to get morning light and evening light.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.140]   The morning light is going to advance my clock,
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.900]   make my system want to get up earlier,
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.360]   and the evening light is going to delay my clock
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.640]   a little bit so that on average,
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.260]   it kind of bookends my circadian mechanisms,
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.260]   and I'll basically want to go to sleep
[00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:26.780]   at more or less the same time each night
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.200]   and wake up more or less at the same time each morning.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.400]   That's how it works.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.000]   And that's a hardwired mechanism.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.500]   That's not some subjective thing that I tell myself.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.720]   That's a hardwired mechanism.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:41.100]   So that gets us to the evening.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.340]   And generally in the evening,
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:44.040]   I'll get that light by going outside,
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:44.980]   or sometimes I'll do it
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.120]   by turning up artificial lights brightly,
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:48.980]   and then I'll start to dim them for the evening,
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.540]   'cause as I've mentioned many times before,
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:52.160]   and I'm not going to belabor the point,
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:54.360]   you want to minimize your light exposure,
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.280]   especially overhead bright light exposure,
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.560]   regardless of whether or not it's blue light or not,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.080]   in the evening from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.560]   Some of you asked, "Wait, I thought it was 11 p.m. to 4 a.m."
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:07.740]   Well, it is, but 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. is even better.
[01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:11.960]   It's just that when I originally said 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.240]   people were like, "That's impossible
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.580]   for most people to adhere to."
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.660]   So for me, it screens off, it's dim lights,
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:21.000]   and that's what favors falling asleep
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.180]   in a good night's sleep for me.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.660]   Since we were talking about food earlier,
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.180]   I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.780]   My evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate rich,
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.240]   if I have proteins, it'll be like eggs, fish,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.840]   or chicken, or something of that sort, or no protein,
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.760]   and I eat high carbohydrates.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.080]   So I'm not one of these people that's keto,
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.120]   or high meat only, or anything like that.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.420]   Remember, fasting in low carbohydrate states
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.540]   facilitate alertness.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:51.440]   Carbohydrate rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.160]   They stimulate the release of tryptophan
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.120]   and the transition to sleep.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.540]   So that's why I do them late in the day.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.300]   Also, if you've exercised early in the day,
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.060]   especially if it's weight-bearing exercise,
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.620]   or everything's weight-bearing exercise,
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.680]   I suppose, unless you're an astronaut, and you're in space.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.420]   But if you're early in the day exercising with weights,
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.900]   or you're doing a long run, or something, sooner or later,
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.740]   you need to replenish glycogen.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.700]   And I realize that the ketonistas out there are gonna say,
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:18.380]   well, you know, gluconeogenesis will allow you
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.220]   to replenish glycogen, et cetera.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.140]   I'm just gonna call out the lie right now,
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.380]   because I feel like doing it,
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.820]   and 'cause I think it just hasn't been stated,
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:32.160]   which is that not everybody, but a lot of the people
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.800]   that are proponents of high-meat keto diets, fine.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.340]   That's fine if that's what they wanna do.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.980]   And as you recall, I do relatively ketogenic diet
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.060]   during the day for alertness or fasting.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:50.340]   But a lot of those people can replenish glycogen really well
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:53.420]   without ingesting carbohydrates, so-called gluconeogenesis,
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.580]   and enhanced protein synthesis,
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.800]   because they are hormone-enhanced.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.820]   And it's just, I've been around a while.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.940]   I know what this looks like.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.380]   They're either thyroid-enhanced or hormone-enhanced,
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.140]   and I don't pass any judgment.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.220]   But when you look at people who look amazing on keto
[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.020]   and are able to have a lot of energy
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.660]   and replenish their glycogen on keto,
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.420]   they are, in many cases, not all,
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.320]   but in many cases, they're hormone-enhanced.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.400]   They're taking exogenous hormones
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:26.380]   that allow them to synthesize and repair muscle
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:28.080]   in ways that people who aren't taking
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.520]   those exogenous hormones can't.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.460]   This is not just true of the men, by the way.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:32.760]   This is also true of the women.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.340]   And this is a whole discussion unto itself,
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.660]   probably not directly related to this month of the podcast.
[01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.900]   So I don't mind that people do this,
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.700]   but one problem is when people are following
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.700]   ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.780]   and they have trouble with sleep,
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:48.300]   or they're doing long bouts of fasting
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.100]   and they're having trouble falling asleep,
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:50.940]   that makes sense.
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.340]   It's because their autonomic arousal
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.860]   is tilted towards epinephrine release,
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.180]   norepinephrine release, and dopamine release.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.200]   So they have a lot of energy,
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.620]   but they have a hard time calming down
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:01.420]   and getting into deep sleep.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.180]   I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates,
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.340]   and it also replenishes glycogen.
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.960]   So again, you know, I'm not trying to draw any fire,
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.500]   but if I do, I'd be happy to have a conversation
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:13.960]   about all that.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:16.600]   Again, no judgment, but I think that most people out there
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.420]   are not aware of some of the other variables.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.720]   Remember, good science is about isolating variables.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.620]   And so oftentimes what we're seeing in social media
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.020]   is we're getting presented single variables
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.540]   and we're not seeing the full context
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:31.120]   of the other variables that are being manipulated.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.260]   So I eat pasta and rice and vegetables
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.320]   and things like that in the evening.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.060]   Also, I just find maybe I'm becoming one of the last people
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.780]   that does that, although I hope not.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.760]   I hope there are others out there like me,
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.100]   but I just, from all the literature speaks to the fact
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.020]   that carbohydrates not only do that,
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.060]   but they also help maintain
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   healthy thyroid function, et cetera.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.820]   So that's my bias, that's what I do.
[01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:55.740]   I do avoid caffeine and whatnot in the evening.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:58.220]   I do take supplements and I'll be happy at some point
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.920]   to put out the complete list of supplements
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.940]   that I take out there.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.140]   But in general, these are the core things that I do
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.820]   and they relate to a lot of the questions
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.180]   that you've been asking over time.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.980]   The next piece of scientific data that I'm going to describe
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:14.520]   is a very important piece of scientific data
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.780]   for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain
[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.900]   and access sleep.
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.220]   It also can help and avoid a lot of anxiety issues.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.740]   And these relate to data from Charles Zeisler,
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.140]   doctor, he's an MD,
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.340]   Chuck Zeisler's lab at Harvard Medical School.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.420]   He's run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.360]   for a long time now, does very impressive work.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.840]   And what he's shown is that the peak output
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.500]   of the circadian clock for wakefulness,
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.600]   in other words, the peak of our wakefulness
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.920]   and the suppression of the sleep signal
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.100]   actually happens very late in the day.
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.360]   So we have this trough of activity
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.460]   and body temperature is lowest right before waking.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:57.720]   Then as we wake up, our body temperature goes up
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.120]   and into the afternoon, it continues to go up, up, up, up, up
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.260]   and then it tends to fall in the evening
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.940]   and towards bedtime.
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:08.760]   But there's a brief blip of release of peptides
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.020]   and other substances from the sleep centers in the brain
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.880]   and the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.520]   The sleep center is this preoptic area
[01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.080]   that if you want to look that up,
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.520]   this preoptic area not far from the circadian clock
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.780]   that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.940]   about an hour before bedtime.
[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.340]   You say, "Whoa, that's really weird."
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.860]   But a lot of people get into bed,
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.680]   they're ready to go to sleep and they're wide awake
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.260]   and they think this is an unnatural thing
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.260]   or there's something wrong with them.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.780]   And actually it's not.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.780]   This, it's believed, I don't know,
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.900]   again, I wasn't consulted at the design phase,
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.340]   but this is, it's believed is a signal
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.920]   that is helpful to human beings
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.320]   to start gathering up resources
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.380]   and securing themselves for a night's sleep
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:55.200]   during which we historically were very vulnerable
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.860]   to attack from other humans and from animals and so forth.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.140]   And so that desire to run around and clean the kitchen
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.140]   or organize things or just a general feeling
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.860]   of internal anxiety late in the evening,
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.940]   that's a natural blip that naturally passes
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.360]   after about 45 to 60 minutes.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.260]   Now that's often the time when people start stressing
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:17.120]   about the fact that they have something to do the next day
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.640]   and they worry about not being able to sleep
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.820]   and it can cascade into a whole set of things.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:23.260]   So another thing that I do throughout my day
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.240]   is I know that early day I'm gonna be alert,
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.880]   afternoon I'm gonna be kind of sleepy.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.120]   And then as the evening comes around,
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.480]   in addition to doing all the other things I'm doing,
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.240]   I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.840]   and I don't worry about it.
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.080]   I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.960]   But basically I just go through,
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.260]   if I'm gonna do anything, it's gonna be very mundane tasks
[01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:48.560]   like cleaning or things that require almost zero effort.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.680]   And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too.
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.620]   But the fact of the matter is
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:56.680]   we don't just go drift off into sleep.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.680]   There's this blip of alertness right before sleep
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.620]   that I hope just cognitively knowing about
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:02.400]   will be helpful to people.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.980]   And that raises yet another theme
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.300]   that I think is going to be very important,
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:11.540]   which is physiological mechanisms
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.440]   like these changes in alertness or using breathing tools,
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.260]   something we'll talk about in future episodes,
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.460]   to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.240]   Those are concrete biological phenomenon.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.520]   So is fasting.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.020]   Fasting will increase alertness that way.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.280]   So is caffeine.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.040]   Not everybody's susceptible to caffeine
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.280]   to the same degree or others,
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.360]   but it's a physiological mechanisms.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.760]   We know the receptors, we know the ligands as they're called,
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.180]   which bind to the receptors.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.380]   We know the mechanisms.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:40.920]   They involve cortisol and epinephrine.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.140]   Those are the sorts of things
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.400]   that I personally try and leverage
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.320]   toward my learning and optimization of my brain
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.820]   and my activity.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.560]   Doing physical activity early in the day, for instance,
[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.480]   tends to give us a longer duration wake-up signal
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.140]   and tends to accelerate waking up early in the day.
[01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:58.480]   That's why working out late in the day
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.760]   can sometimes cause people to have trouble falling asleep.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.080]   It will also phase delay you,
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.440]   make it so that you want to wake up later the next day.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.500]   It's not just 'cause you're tired,
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.700]   it's 'cause you shifted your clock
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.200]   with activity and temperature.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:14.200]   Many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.480]   What about visualization?
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.720]   Can we just imagine doing a particular activity?
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.500]   Will that help us get better at that activity?
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.120]   There are some evidence that visualization can do that.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.240]   It's true, but here's the important distinction,
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.720]   and here's why I personally don't do
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.900]   much deliberate visualization.
[01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:37.820]   First of all, I get my best ability
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.880]   or achieve my best ability to visualize things
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.520]   when I'm in kind of a sleepy state.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.160]   I don't know why, but that's when I'm able
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.560]   to direct my brain towards internal visualization
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.520]   with my eyes closed.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:50.040]   And generally I fall asleep and I can't remember anything
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.680]   that I was thinking about before.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:54.840]   Some people, and these are work that was done many years ago
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.880]   by Roger Shepherd and by others.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.720]   Roger was at Stanford, and other labs have done this too,
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.640]   of course, of rotating objects physically in their mind
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.780]   as a way of improving or looking at the speed
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:09.740]   of spatial calculations and so forth.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.000]   Some people are very good at visualization.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.980]   They can close their eyes and they can just see objects
[01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:17.920]   and rotate them deliberately, et cetera.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.520]   A lot of people like me, when we start doing that,
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.440]   our mind drifts too easily.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.920]   But I like to think I'm a reasonably focused person
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.600]   in the waking state.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.600]   So visualization has, it's interesting
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.140]   'cause I think people are very attracted to the idea
[01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.540]   that they can just think about something
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.080]   and then get better at it that way.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.040]   And it's probably true if you can be very linear
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.640]   in the way that you visualize things.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.460]   So I wanna repeat that.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.040]   I think visualization does have certain power
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.920]   if you can remain very linear and deliberate and focused
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.440]   in the visualization.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.200]   But many people like myself who are challenged
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.320]   with maintaining that linear focus with eyes closed
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.080]   and in visualization,
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.440]   they don't get much out of visualization.
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.520]   And I think the data on performance really supports that.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.000]   Now, there are examples where, for instance,
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.480]   people will injure one limb
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.600]   and then they will exercise the intact limb
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.600]   or the non-injured limb rather,
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.720]   and they will visualize the opposite limb.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.640]   Sometimes there's even the use of mirror boxes
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.000]   so that let's say my left limb is injured.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.100]   I'm maintaining activity with my right limb,
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.200]   but I'm using a mirror box
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.480]   so it looks like my left limb is working well.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.120]   Yes, there's some top-down or feedback mechanisms
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.360]   that support the idea that the injured limb
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.960]   can rehabilitate more quickly, et cetera.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.700]   But those are fairly elaborate schemes.
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.540]   These aren't the kinds of,
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.520]   I don't have mirror boxes around my house.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.880]   I think these are specialized circumstances.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.360]   They're a little bit like the examples
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.280]   that we see in the news where, oh, so-and-so has a stroke
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.560]   and then spontaneously speaks a new language.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.480]   I don't know what the answer to that is.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.180]   It shows that the brain has associative networks
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.960]   that are typically suppressed and those can be unleashed.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.220]   But you certainly don't want to go out
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.500]   and give yourself a stroke deliberately
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.060]   to try and unmask some skill
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:11.880]   because there's no concrete way to go about that
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.160]   in a way that you could really know
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:14.020]   that you were going to offset
[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.360]   the detrimental effects of the stroke.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.300]   In fact, I think it'd be a terrible idea.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:22.320]   So I think what I'm trying to describe is how a typical,
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   I don't know if I'm typical or normal.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.040]   I mean, I've been told otherwise is certainly not normal.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.880]   But in terms of the way that I structure my day,
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.640]   I think that's normal.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.660]   That's pretty normal.
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.800]   I tend to wake up right around, I don't know,
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.000]   somewhere between 5.30 and 7 a.m.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.500]   depending on what I've been doing the night before.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.760]   I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10.30, 11.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.540]   I tend to have one bout in the morning
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.880]   where I can do really focused, hard work.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.920]   And I can really activate the go pathway
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.240]   while also activating the no-go pathway
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.680]   so that I can really stay focused,
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.120]   but I rely on some tools.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.400]   I have a period in the afternoon where I get sleepy
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.520]   and kind of out of it like I think most people.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:01.200]   And I tend to come out of that
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.000]   recognizing the opportunity of that slightly sleepy state
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.480]   for creative work and for thinking about things
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.920]   in novel ways.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.720]   I get light a couple times a day.
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.800]   I eat low carb during the day and I eat,
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.000]   I don't say high, but higher carb.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   I eat starches in the evening so in a way I can sleep.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.040]   And then I really anticipate that late afternoon
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.360]   peak and alertness, excuse me, late night peak
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:30.440]   and alertness that many people confuse for insomnia
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.760]   or challenges when actually they're really quite normal
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.600]   in their circadian cycle.
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.720]   And then I fall asleep and if all goes well,
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.000]   I stay asleep for four or five hours.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.280]   Typically it's three or four and then I wake up.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.340]   I think I'm like most people,
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:47.140]   I wake up during the middle of the night.
[01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.500]   Now, one thing that I don't think has been discussed a lot,
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.200]   but that one of my colleagues at the Stanford Sleep Lab
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.120]   tells me is that every hour and a half or so we all wake up.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.280]   Some of you even look around, believe it or not,
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.160]   and go right back to sleep and you don't recognize it.
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   Waking up periodically during sleep is the norm.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.200]   It is not abnormal.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.360]   I don't know why this has been discussed more prominently.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.780]   I tend to wake up and if there's a bright light
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.200]   coming through the blinds or if there's some noise upstairs,
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.360]   if Costello's snoring particularly loud, I might get up.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.480]   I might go use the restroom.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.060]   I might pick up a book and read under low light or something
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.800]   and then I generally fall back asleep
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.320]   and wake up, typical time for me again,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.640]   5.30 to 7 a.m. in the morning.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.600]   This waking up in the middle of the night thing,
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.360]   as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast episode today
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.040]   is not necessarily abnormal.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.520]   What it probably reflects is that the real time,
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.600]   meaning the time that I should go to sleep
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.240]   is probably closer to eight o'clock.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.560]   The word midnight was literally supposed to mean midnight.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.080]   We, many, meaning all of us,
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.760]   were meant to go to sleep and wake up with the rise,
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.360]   you know, with the setting and rising of the sun.
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   And we know this because this beautiful study
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.920]   from University of Colorado
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.460]   where they took people out into the wilderness
[01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.040]   to reset their circadian clocks
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.200]   by way of, you know, measured by way of melatonin
[01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.660]   and cortisol and they had them,
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.900]   they were completely out of whack
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.200]   from interacting with screens
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.400]   and staying up too late, et cetera.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.800]   And they basically had them view the sunrise
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.160]   and view the sunset each evening.
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.840]   And almost all of them, not all of the students,
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.080]   but all of them got onto a schedule
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.040]   where they naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.720]   and wake up around sunrise or just before sunrise,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.000]   even when they were brought back
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.080]   into a normal artificial light setting.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.720]   So I think that's the natural pattern
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.160]   and we've just deviated from it with artificial lights.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.520]   So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. doesn't necessarily mean
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.840]   that there's something screwed up about you
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.640]   or that, you know, you have anxiety or something,
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:46.840]   although you might.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.960]   The, what it likely means is that you were supposed
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.260]   to go to bed much earlier.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.720]   And because of this asymmetry
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.040]   in the autonomic nervous system
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:55.960]   where it's much easier for us to push
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.720]   and to delay our sleep time
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.040]   than it is to accelerate our wake-up time.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.040]   In other words, it's easier to stay up
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.120]   and hang out at the party,
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.180]   even if you don't wanna be there,
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:07.060]   than it is to wake up when you're exhausted
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.200]   and you're fast asleep.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.440]   Most people are pushing through
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.680]   into the late hours of the evening and night
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.760]   and going to bed much later
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.600]   than they naturally would want to.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.360]   And so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8 p.m.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.180]   A lot of good things happen between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.880]   And so I wanna enjoy those
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.360]   and I push through the evening hours.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.160]   But as a consequence, I'm running out of melatonin.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.120]   My melatonin release has basically subsided
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.180]   by about 3 or 4 a.m.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.260]   And so it makes sense that I would wake up.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.320]   I don't take melatonin
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.140]   for reasons discussed in previous episodes.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.120]   I do rely on things like magnesium glycinate
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.080]   or magnesium threonate, things like theanine.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.880]   I'm not saying any of you need to take those.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.160]   That's just what I happen to take
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.600]   in order to facilitate my sleep
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.760]   and it's been of great benefit to me.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.140]   If I wake up in the middle of the night
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.040]   and I'm anxious for whatever reason and my mind is looping,
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.320]   I have a couple rules.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.880]   One is I don't trust anything I think about
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.840]   when I wake up in the middle of the night, any of it.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.260]   Unless I've had a magnificent dream
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:08.320]   and I wanna write it down,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.920]   I'll do that every once in a while.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.220]   Typically when I go back and read it,
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.140]   it's not at all magnificent.
[01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:16.960]   I can't ever remember coming up with anything
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.040]   really fantastic in one of my dreams
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.000]   that stuck with me or that I implemented.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.060]   I don't really trust the kind of thinking that happens
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:27.040]   in those wee hours of the circadian cycle for me.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.400]   There's just nothing either for me terribly creative
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.420]   or worth linear implementation at that time.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:35.480]   But one thing that has been very helpful
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.240]   is to sometimes do one of these
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.960]   non-sleep deep rest protocols
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   as a way to go back into sleep.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.340]   So a hypnosis app by,
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.920]   or some of the scripts by Michael Sealy
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.300]   that I've mentioned before,
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.400]   or the Reverie Health or a Yoga Nidra protocol.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.800]   Those for me have been very useful
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.660]   at helping me turn off kind of looping thinking
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.320]   in the middle of the night and fall back asleep.
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:01.140]   In reviewing my schedule for you,
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.260]   just as a context for how to implement
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:06.640]   certain types of tools for optimizing learning,
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.440]   realize that it gives the impression
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.760]   that there's a 90 minute bout of learning and work
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.960]   in the morning and then a 90 minute bout
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.680]   of creative type work in the afternoon and that's it.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:17.400]   There are a lot of hours in between, of course,
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.140]   and I just want to be very clear.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.700]   Those hours for me are occupied by pretty,
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.840]   not mundane tasks, but things that are kind of random.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:29.000]   Those are things like email or attending to Zoom meetings
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.680]   or meeting with colleagues and students
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.080]   and things of that sort.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.120]   I sometimes will read just for sake of my own enrichment.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.960]   I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:40.900]   because those are the two 90 minute bouts
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.640]   where I'm trying to expand on the mental capacities
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.000]   that I already have.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.280]   They're really where I'm trying to stretch and grow
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.040]   what I'm able to do on a regular basis reflexively.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.160]   So I want to emphasize that.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.000]   The whole day doesn't just consist
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.080]   of those two 90 minute bouts.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.440]   That's not the way my schedule works
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.120]   and that's not the way my lifestyle is arranged,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:00.320]   which is fortunate 'cause I enjoy
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.640]   all those other things as well.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.000]   And so for many of you out there who are in school
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.280]   or who have family demands or other demands,
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.680]   the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.280]   of about 90 minutes, one or two or maybe more per day,
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.560]   you're trying to slot those in wherever you can
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.240]   amidst your other obligations
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.860]   and things that you need to do.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.440]   But you want to do that in an intelligent way
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.360]   that's anchored to your biology
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.800]   and then you want to do a number of things
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.880]   which I've talked about today
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.840]   in order to optimize those sessions
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.240]   to get the most out of them.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.780]   So as we round up, I acknowledge that once again,
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.080]   I've covered a huge range of topics
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.280]   related to how to optimize learning and brain change
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.840]   and essentially mental performance.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.560]   And I've set that in the context
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.040]   of some biological mechanism
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.340]   like the basal ganglia, go/no-go pathways,
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.760]   the circadian autonomic system
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.920]   and some of the relationship between food and fasting
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:59.060]   and particular types of food in alertness or sleepiness,
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.000]   how linear focus and strategy implementation
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.440]   is best served by high alert states, although not too alert,
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.920]   and how creative states,
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.880]   at least the first phase of creativity,
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.200]   which is the creative arrangement kind of brainstorming stage
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.360]   is supported by states of kind of relaxation
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:18.720]   or even slightly sleepy,
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.120]   but the creative implementation
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.820]   is a very linear and focused and deliberate process,
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:26.840]   much like the highly focused state that I described.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.560]   I described how I do these things
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.880]   just to give you a context.
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.900]   A lot of you asked for what I do
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.400]   in order to set it within a context,
[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.420]   but by no means are these rigid times
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.640]   and ways of doing things.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.080]   But I think it's fair to say that
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.640]   what I do has a circadian logic.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.180]   It also has grounding in biological mechanisms.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.440]   They're very concrete that we know the cells and mechanisms
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.760]   and neurotransmitters.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.920]   And then some of them are a little bit headed out
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:55.820]   into the what we would call kind of emerging
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:58.600]   or I don't want to say cutting edge,
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.520]   but maybe a front edge of what neuroscience
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.240]   is starting to understand about creativity and so forth.
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:07.760]   Those are areas that are just now coming to some clarity
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:10.160]   and there's certainly still a lot more work to do.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.900]   A lot of different ways to arrange one's routine,
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.800]   but hopefully the tools and practices that I described
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.800]   will be useful to you.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.000]   I want to mention that a lot of people ask me
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.420]   about specific tools and practices.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.840]   They ask me about Wim Hof breathing, about ice baths.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.960]   I've talked a little bit about ice baths before,
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.440]   I think in cold exposure,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.240]   about binaural beats and things of those sort.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.440]   I think the way to look at any tool
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.960]   to modulate or measure the nervous system
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   is ask whether or not it's going to move you up or down
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.760]   the state of autonomic arousal,
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.180]   whether or not it's gonna make you more alert or more calm,
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:47.760]   more focused or less focused.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.480]   That's kind of the two axes here
[01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.200]   is that we need to think about.
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.220]   Sometimes you want to be more alert than you are.
[01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.320]   And indeed things like cold showers, ice baths,
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.180]   super oxygenation, Wim Hof type breathing
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.400]   will bring your level of alertness up.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.520]   There's some cautionary notes associated with each of those.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.960]   You need to read and understand those cautionary notes
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.820]   for yourself, everybody's different.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.680]   And some of those carry certain dangers
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:11.120]   under certain conditions.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   Others have huge margins for safety.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.200]   An ice bath generally wakes you up.
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.080]   A warmer hot bath generally calms you down, right?
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:22.800]   Binaural beats, there aren't a lot of data
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.320]   in quality peer reviewed journals.
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.120]   I did put in the effort to go search it out.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.960]   There are a few.
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.320]   Binaural beats are listening to frequencies of sound
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.200]   that slightly differ or offset for the two ears.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.080]   It has been shown can shift the brain
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.200]   into particular states.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.240]   You'll notice today I didn't really talk about alpha
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.920]   or theta or gamma rhythms.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.200]   I personally in reviewing the literature,
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.280]   I don't think it's fair to say that alpha states
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.640]   are great for X and theta states are great for Y.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   And besides most of us aren't walking around our homes
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.900]   and our workplaces geared up to EEG machines
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:56.240]   or with wires down below our skull.
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.760]   So we don't know when we're in those states anyway.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:02.560]   I think the subjective reading of whether or not one
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.520]   is alert or calm and whether or not that alertness
[01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.560]   or calmness matches the goal or that thing
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.780]   that we're trying to achieve in terms of learning,
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:16.680]   including sleep, is the most valuable internal tool
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.220]   and recognition that we can all have.
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.040]   In other words, if I want to be very alert
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:22.180]   and I need to be very alert and I'm exhausted,
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:24.440]   there might be tools that I should use to wake up.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.040]   It might also speak to the fact that I might not have slept
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.240]   as well as I could ever should have the night before.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:32.120]   So it's really about a match between where we are
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.840]   on that autonomic arousal scale
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.320]   and what we're trying to achieve.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.400]   And indeed, there are going to be a lot of tools,
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.720]   including supplements and other prescription drugs
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:42.500]   and things that can help move us along
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:45.820]   that autonomic continuum toward more alertness
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:47.600]   or toward more calmness.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.680]   But ultimately, it's about tailoring that alertness
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:53.040]   and calmness to the specific types of learning
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:55.940]   and activities that you are going to do and perform.
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.540]   And it's reciprocal, meaning some of those activities
[01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:02.200]   like exercise early in the day will increase your level
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:04.440]   of autonomic arousal and alertness.
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.300]   Certain foods will tend to wake you up.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.340]   Certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.720]   And the volume of food and the timing of food
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.940]   is a factor also.
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:14.720]   So it's a huge parameter space.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.220]   It's a huge set of variables.
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.140]   The impacts, whether or not we're feeling well,
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:21.040]   performing well, learning great or not learning great.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.100]   And the key thing is to become an observer
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.500]   of your own system and what works for you.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.900]   And to recognize that there are two bins of tools
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:33.140]   for optimizing learning and brain performance.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.400]   One are tools that are really anchored
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.720]   in biological mechanism.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.600]   And we are certain of what those are.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   And I've talked about some of those.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.140]   The other, the more subjective tools.
[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:45.060]   For some of you, visualization might work terrifically well.
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.580]   For some of you, one song might really wake you up
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.680]   because of the associations you have with it.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.280]   And for me, it might repel me from the room
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.960]   'cause I don't like it or it might put me to sleep.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.740]   But of course, volume is kind of a universal.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.340]   Loud music tends to wake people up.
[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:03.400]   Soft music doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.080]   So part of today is really getting you to think about
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.620]   in a scientific way, in a structured way,
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:13.560]   about the non-negotiable elements,
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.340]   which are that you're going to have a period
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.620]   of every 24 hour cycle when you tend to be more awake
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:19.280]   and a period when you tend to be more asleep
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.560]   and how to leverage those
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.400]   so you're not fighting an uphill battle
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.060]   to wake up when you actually would want to be
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.360]   and should be sleepy and not trying to go to sleep
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.960]   when you are naturally going to be most awake.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.660]   So a lot of it is really anchors back
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.600]   to those core mechanisms of biology.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:38.680]   And then you start layering on the different protocols
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.880]   of food and supplementation, et cetera.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.520]   And I think it's important to recognize
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:46.040]   that some people are just more go, go, go, go, go
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:46.880]   and no go.
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.120]   And some people are just calmer
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.800]   and have a harder time getting into action and an activity.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.340]   It's just the way that we're wired.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.020]   Some of us have autonomic nervous systems
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:59.320]   that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.520]   One of the reasons I love bulldogs, not just my bulldog,
[01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.460]   is that they are very calm animals.
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:06.920]   In fact, they make no spontaneous movements
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.960]   unless there's something to respond to.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.140]   And I find that incredibly relaxing.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:12.680]   Other animals like pit bulls,
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.020]   who I also really like and enjoy and other species,
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:16.260]   their tail's always wagging
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:17.800]   and that they're always in a position
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.800]   to make a movement at any second
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.680]   'cause they tend to ride
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.960]   at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.600]   They pop up really quickly
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.480]   when you say it's time to go for a walk.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:30.000]   Costello does it one limb at a time
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.900]   and sometimes he just goes back to sleep.
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.280]   And so there are people like that too.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.980]   And so you have to know where you are
[01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:38.520]   and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.280]   As a final closure to this,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   I want to emphasize that today, as always,
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.020]   I've strived to be accurate.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.200]   I'm sure if I made mistakes, some of you will point it out
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.200]   and I appreciate that and I'll post a correction
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.220]   if we agree that I indeed misspoke or missighted something.
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.920]   But by no means was I exhaustive.
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.480]   I mean, I might've exhausted some of you,
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:03.680]   but the information wasn't exhaustive.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.960]   Meaning there's no way that I could cover
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.600]   all the ways in which we optimize
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.040]   or can optimize learning and performance.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.680]   I think we've touched on a number of them
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.120]   that I hope that you'll find value in
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.320]   and that you'll explore in your own lives.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.880]   We are continuing with this theme
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.800]   because that's what we do for this podcast.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.020]   We stay on one theme for an entire month.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.280]   For the next episode,
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.040]   we're going to explore two very essential aspects
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:32.220]   of neuroplasticity that actually relate to learning,
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.220]   which are pain, pain management, and neural regeneration.
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:40.600]   And for those of you that don't have injuries
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.680]   or don't suffer from chronic pain,
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.440]   the discussion is still going to be a very important one
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.400]   because it's not just going to be about pain
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.440]   that you're trying to get rid of.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.520]   It's also going to be about how certain sensory experiences
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:55.060]   within the pain network can become amplified,
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.600]   as well as how we can use top-down modulation.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.520]   We can use our mind to suppress the pain response.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.360]   We're also going to talk about
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.320]   some of the hardwired mechanisms that are bottom-up,
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:09.160]   that exist in our periphery, in our body, to control pain.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.720]   And we're also going to discuss
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.280]   a number of interesting interactions
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.020]   between the pain system and the learning system.
[01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:19.180]   So again, if you're not interested in pain per se,
[01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:22.100]   it still is going to be a very valid conversation
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.300]   for sake of understanding how to optimize brain performance.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:27.500]   And neural regeneration goes hand in hand
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.920]   with that discussion.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.620]   So I hope you'll join us for that.
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:33.800]   I suppose I'd be remiss if I didn't mention
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:37.500]   that Costello has been snoring extremely loudly today.
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.760]   You know, a good long walk this morning,
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.740]   which means up the driveway, down the driveway.
[01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:42.860]   He's an old dog.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.560]   So if you've been hearing him in the background
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.800]   and it's been distracting, now you know why.
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.120]   It probably relates to where you were
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.220]   on your level of autonomic arousal.
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.640]   And I'll leave it to you to answer
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.840]   that question for yourself.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.400]   Many of you continue to graciously ask
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.440]   how you can help support the podcast.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.380]   We really appreciate the question.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:03.660]   The best way is to subscribe wherever it is
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.220]   you happen to be listening or watching.
[01:28:05.220 --> 01:28:07.320]   So for those of you that it's YouTube,
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.440]   please subscribe to the YouTube channel.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.160]   If it's Apple, subscribe to the podcast on Apple,

[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:24.400]   please place those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.020]   Apple also provides a section
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:27.960]   where you can give us a rating.
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.560]   We would love it if you give us a five-star rating
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.060]   or whatever it is that you feel that we deserve.
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.960]   And in general, if you could tell people about the podcast,
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.260]   we hope that you would tell them
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.420]   because you think the information
[01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.920]   would be of use to them, of course.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.840]   Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your coworkers,
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.940]   because as we expand the podcast,
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:47.520]   the support for the podcast just grows along with it.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.560]   So that's a terrific way to support us.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.360]   As always, check out our sponsors,
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.240]   which were mentioned at the beginning.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.320]   And in addition to that, we've now set up a Patreon account.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.920]   Some of you asked specifically
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.400]   how you can help support the podcast,
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.620]   but you weren't interested in our sponsors
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.920]   or you were already engaged with our sponsors.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.640]   So we have a Patreon account.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.540]   You can find it at patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.960]   Finally, in previous episodes today and in future episodes,
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.480]   I mentioned supplements.
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:19.600]   Supplements are one way, certainly not the only way,
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.280]   but they're one way in which we can modulate
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.160]   our nervous system for sake of better sleep,
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:28.940]   learning, alertness, and several other things as well.
[01:29:28.940 --> 01:29:30.320]   If you're interested in supplements,
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:33.960]   we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.800]   because Thorne supplements have very high stringency
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.880]   in terms of what's in the bottle,
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.320]   the amounts of the substances that are in each capsule
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.180]   or pill, et cetera.
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.560]   And they have partnered with other groups
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.960]   such as the Mayo Clinic, all the major sports teams.
[01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.000]   So there's very high rigor associated with Thorne,
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.160]   which is why we've decided to partner with them.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.840]   If you'd like to check out Thorne supplements
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.520]   and see the supplements that I take,
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   you can go to thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.440]   .com/u/huberman, and you'll see a list
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:04.660]   of some of the supplements that I take.
[01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:07.160]   As well, you'll get 20% off
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.120]   any of the supplements listed there,
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.980]   as well as anywhere else on the Thorne website.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   So that's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, .com/u/huberman
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:19.880]   for 20% off any Thorne supplements.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:23.920]   Last but not least, on behalf of me and Costello,
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.280]   I want to thank you for your time and attention today.
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:29.520]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.100]   [upbeat music]
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.680]   (upbeat music)
