[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Andrew from Benton, Kansas writes in,
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400]   Pastor John, you once described how you would explain
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.920]   Christian hedonism to somebody over lunch at Pizza Hut.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.140]   Realizing divine election may take a bit longer,
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.240]   what is the easiest way to share this with someone
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   and with what key scripture would you explain it
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.200]   over, say, a weekend brunch?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.220]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.360]   - Okay, so we're moving from a Christian hedonism
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.160]   Pizza Hut lunch to an election lunch.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.440]   - A weekend brunch some more time.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   - Brunch, brunch, okay.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.480]   All right, good.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.400]   Now I'm going to assume that we're talking to a Christian.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.900]   I don't know if that's the intention,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.660]   but I'm gonna assume it because if the person,
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.660]   we're not a Christian, election is not where
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.800]   I would go first.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.640]   (laughs)
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.160]   I would go to the gospel, I might get around to election
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.440]   and they may have a question about it
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.400]   and that would be okay, but that's not the first
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   on the agenda.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.860]   So my first assumption is we're talking to a believer
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.580]   who's got some stumbling blocks or problems
[00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.840]   with the doctrine of election,
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   is not sure what he believes about it.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.280]   And I'm going to assume that we're on the same page
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.940]   with regard to the authority of the Bible,
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.000]   because I don't think anybody comes to the doctrine
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.940]   of election without believing that the Bible teaches it
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.920]   and submitting to the Bible.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.840]   So that's what I'm assuming.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.540]   Now here's my approach.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.240]   I would not start with election directly.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.120]   I would start by asking this person to describe to me
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.360]   how they got saved.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.480]   That is, tell me how you were converted
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.640]   or actually the words I would use to make it more clear
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880]   instead of that passive got saved,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120]   I would say, how did God save you?
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.240]   I mean, historically, what did he do in history to save you?
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.040]   And existentially, what did he do 10 years ago
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.800]   or when you were six or when you were 16
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.240]   or when you were 30?
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.880]   What did he do?
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   Describe to me how God brought you to himself.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I'm looking here to see how a person describes
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.120]   their lostness and the action of God
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.340]   to bring them out of blindness, to see,
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.520]   to bring them out of deadness, to life,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.560]   to bring them out of insensitivity to spiritual things,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.400]   to being thrilled with spiritual things.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.260]   I'm looking for that kind of description.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040]   And what I find in approaching election this way,
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.400]   I'm going at it through the,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.800]   I'm going up to election by the effects of election.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   What I find is that very few people that I ever talk to
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.040]   about their conversion want to take decisive credit
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.160]   for their conversion.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.620]   They want to say, "There but for the grace of God go I."
[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.160]   And if they stumble here, then I would say,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.320]   when you stand before God, if he asks you,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.080]   "Why did you recognize me as true and believe
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.120]   while others in your similar situation didn't?"
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   I'll ask them that question.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.080]   Few people, few people want to answer,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   "Well, 'cause I was smarter or wiser or more spiritual
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.000]   or more teachable."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.040]   Almost every Christian I've ever talked to,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.520]   in fact, I can't think of an exception,
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.160]   wants to answer, "It was grace.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.080]   It was grace all the way down.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   That's why I had my eyes opened and that's why I saw you."
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.280]   Now, at this point, with their hearts leaning
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.680]   in that direction, leaning in the right direction,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.720]   and I think people who are born again
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.160]   do lean in the right direction,
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   I take them to texts that teach what really happened to them
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.560]   just to affirm what they've already hinted at
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.400]   and they may not know from the Bible.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.880]   And this is still coming at election,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.600]   but it's got to settle first how they got saved.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.080]   So I would say to the formerly blind person,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.480]   God who said, "Let light shine out of darkness,"
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.880]   has shown in our hearts to give the light
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.200]   of the knowledge of the glory of God.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   So once we had no light and God gave it,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.380]   just like on the first day of creation,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.920]   I'd say to the formerly dead person,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.080]   "Even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.200]   God made us alive.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.240]   So we were dead, God made you alive.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.520]   That's how you got saved."
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.360]   I'd say to the unrepentant, formerly unrepentant person,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   2 Timothy 2.25, "The servant of the Lord must be patient
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.800]   and correct with gentleness.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.500]   God may perhaps grant them repentance.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.720]   God may grant them repentance,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.140]   leading to a knowledge of the truth."
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.960]   So I'd say, "So how did you come to repentance?
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.000]   God granted you repentance."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.880]   So God gave them sight, God gave them life,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.440]   God gave them repentance, and no one can come to me
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.360]   unless it is granted to him by the Father,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.340]   and so God gave you approach.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.080]   And I would ask at each point if they saw
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.080]   that God was the decisive cause of their seeing Christ
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.060]   as true and desirable and the source
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   of their spiritual life and their repentance
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.680]   and their coming to Christ.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.040]   And if they push back and deny this
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   and insist that they have ultimate self-determination
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.920]   and they themselves are decisively responsible
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.280]   for their own conversion, I'd stop there
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.680]   and wouldn't go on to election
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.120]   because they've already rejected the foundations.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.320]   If they have to have self-determination
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.200]   as the ultimate cause of their conversion,
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.240]   then election is already undermined
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.800]   and there's no biblical teaching that will make it plain
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.600]   because the teachings that I just gave them
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.360]   about how they got converted are more plain.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.640]   But if they're still agreeing, if they're agreeing,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   yes, God saved me, God was the decisive cause,
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   then I would ask them, when did God decide to do that?
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.740]   And to get the biblical answer,
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.760]   I'd probably look first at Acts 13, 48,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.080]   where it says, "As many as were appointed
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.620]   "to eternal life believed."
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.080]   As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.080]   There was a prior decision, appointment, election,
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.120]   and then faith followed.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   God decided at a prior time to bring you to belief,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.160]   to open your eyes and to give you repentance.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.440]   And then I would turn to election, Ephesians 1, 4.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.960]   Even as he chose us, he elected us,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.920]   he chose us in him before the foundation of the world.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.400]   And I would simply say, the very way you have been saved,
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   that you agree with, that God saved you,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.440]   he decided to do that before he did it.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   He's not a God who is whimsical,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.800]   he doesn't get taken off guard, he doesn't have plan Bs.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   He saved you sovereignly because he decided to.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.600]   And that would be the end of my effort.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.980]   Though, if they had more time,
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.640]   I might write down on a napkin,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.720]   Romans 8, 30, Romans 9, 11, Romans 11, 5,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.640]   1 Corinthians 1, 23 to 24, and send them off to study,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.440]   and then we could talk again.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.080]   Those are all texts about election.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.720]   But the aim of the conversation would be to awaken,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.100]   in both of us, a greater sense of wonder
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.120]   that we are saved and that we owe it all to God.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.360]   That apart from him, we can do nothing,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.760]   and therefore all of our lives should be lived
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.840]   in the constant amazement that we are saved,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.640]   and that he would die for us,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.600]   and that he would give us sight instead of blindness,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   and life instead of deadness.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.600]   In fact, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 1, 26, following,
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.440]   "God chose, God elected things that are not
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.480]   "to bring to nothing things that are
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.440]   "so that no human being might boast."
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.600]   In other words, election strips of boasting,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.360]   but let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.800]   So the bottom line of the goal of that lunch
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.760]   is humility in us and all glory to God.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.560]   - Yes, and amen.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.320]   And we mentioned earlier, there's an episode
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.160]   in which you talk about Pizza Hut.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.200]   It's the episode titled,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.800]   "How to Explain Christian Hedonism Over Lunch."
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.360]   That's episode number 356.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   You can find that episode in the archive.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.560]   And now there's a new way to search and navigate
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   the archive of over 500 episodes we have released to date.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.400]   We have apps for the Apple and Android devices, of course,
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.840]   where you can do that.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.280]   And now we have a landing page on our website as well.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.440]   Go to desiringgod.org.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.120]   At the top of the page, click the tab that says More,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.760]   and then click on Ask Pastor John.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.320]   And there you can search the entire database
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.080]   of episodes by title.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.880]   Look for episode number 356 if you wanna hear
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.200]   Pastor John talk about Pizza Hut.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.200]   Well, if God is sovereign, why does he not blank?
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.760]   We get a lot of those types of questions,
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.280]   and they're good questions, they're tough questions.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.040]   And tomorrow, Leah writes in to ask,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.400]   if God is so happy, why did he create the non-elect
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.640]   who would perish forever?

[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.800]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.400]   (gentle music)
