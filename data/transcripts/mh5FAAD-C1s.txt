[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.080]   In today's deep dive, I want to tackle the question,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   how do I tame email? Now, this continues the trend I started last week of trying to do more
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.920]   practical topics in the deep dive. I want to get my hands dirty with actual advice that you can put
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.320]   into action and help your life today. This doesn't mean I'm not going to get back to my more
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.280]   philosophical rants or cultural critiques, but let's do a few of these deep dives that are more
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800]   practical. All right, so here's the question. You hate your inbox, let's say. You open it,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.960]   it's full of stuff. It stresses you out. Why does it stress you out and what can we do about it?
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.320]   To answer this question, I think it is really important to look at all of that junk sitting
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.160]   there in your inbox and divide it up into categories. This is a key thing that's often
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.120]   missing when we give advice about email is that the different types of messages merit different
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.800]   responses. So roughly speaking, I can divide the messages you see in that stress inducing inbox
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.440]   into three categories. Number one, broadcast, information being broadcast to you that does
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.280]   not require a response. It may or may not be interesting to you. So this could be newsletters
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.680]   like my newsletter, which of course you should subscribe to account newport.com. It could be
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.600]   announcements from the HR department and your organization or it could be those annoying
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.080]   sales emails that any store that you've ever given your email address to for any reason bombard you
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.200]   with as if what really matters to you right now is that the 15% sale at Levi's is going to end
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:52.320]   next week. So those are broadcast messages. Then you have questions. This is my term for emails
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.160]   that have something that require a response to you, but probably just one response.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   Hey, Cal, can you let me know what my grade is in the class right now? Can you remind me again
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:10.320]   of when our next meeting is? What do you think? Who do you think we should nominate for the
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.440]   steering committee that we're putting together? So you know, someone needs information from you.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.640]   You can give that information in an email response was probably just going to be one response.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.280]   The third category messages are conversational. These are messages that are part of a longer
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000]   back and forth conversation. So now maybe you're trying to figure out when you are going to meet
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.400]   with a client tomorrow. And you're going back and forth. Hey, what about in the afternoon? They say
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   no, you're like, Okay, I can do the morning, but probably not nine. And like, well, how close to
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.560]   nine, you know what I mean, back and forth. So it's a message that's part of many messages that
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   are going back and forth, that sort of haphazard unscheduled manner. So the gap between each
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.880]   message in the next is unpredictable as part of an ongoing conversation. So when you look at your
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.760]   inbox, and you feel that stress, you're seeing a mix of all three different types of messages in
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.440]   there. Now having these three types is useful because the response to each is different. Let's
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.200]   start with the low hanging fruit, which are broadcast. You hear a lot of advice, especially
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.440]   from more tech oriented individuals who like having tool based solutions surrounding broadcast,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.800]   oh my god, I get too many of these emails, I wish I could tame it. This is not a major problem.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.880]   It's annoying. If you have a bunch of broadcast messages in there that most of them you don't
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.120]   care about, because it's visual clutter, and you have to get around them. But it's not super
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.000]   stress inducing. A you can ignore them or B, you can just quickly delete or archive them,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.600]   which honestly is actually kind of fulfilling. Is there anything better that when you see a really
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.920]   full inbox to be able to make progress get 50% of those messages out of there in just two minutes
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.640]   by just deleting lots of things. That being said, there are any number of ways you can tame broadcast.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.680]   The best feature right now is probably what you'll see in a product like Gmail or Gmail has
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.280]   really good AI powered filters. It's very good at figuring out what are promotional messages.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.720]   I basically never see promotional messages from retailers at all anymore, because it all gets
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.280]   pushed into a promotional folder. From what I understand, I don't use social media. But from
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.160]   what I understand, those Gmail AI based filters are very good at social media notifications of
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.520]   putting them in another folder. So you don't have to see them if you don't want to. Beyond that,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   obviously, unsubscribe. You know, every time you're about to archive a message, or delete a
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080]   message from a newsletter, some other type of news source that once again, you're not going to read
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.560]   and have it read in a while, take five extra seconds to try to unsubscribe. Gmail has a feature
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.480]   now you can click it'll try to do that for you automatically. One caveat. If you try to unsubscribe
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   from cal newport.com, you and your family will be struck with bad luck for three generations. So
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.920]   don't do that. But any other one, unsubscribe, liberally, that really can help. You might also
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.320]   try having a dedicated email address for just this type of information. This is more possible
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.720]   if you're a freelancer and individual. So you're not getting messages from your employer. But you
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.480]   can have a signup address, sign up at whatever.com that you give when everyone needs an email address
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   when the retailer needs an email address when the person at the store wants you to give an email
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.000]   address and you have some address signup at cal newport.com. You create some address, you know,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.680]   it could be a gmail, sign up, dot your original gmail name at gmail.com. Just make a new account,
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.320]   whatever, and just use that. Right? That's one thing you can do. And then you have a different
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.520]   account and go check this occasionally for my newsletters or what have you. So there's strategies
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.400]   here, but I'm not worried about broadcast. All right, let's talk about question emails. Now,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.640]   here's the thing about question emails. If you take an individual question email in isolation,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.120]   and bring it to me and say, Oh, Cal, thank you for coming. I have this thing I need you to answer.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.960]   Here you go. It's usually no sweat. It's like, Oh, that's interesting question. Yeah, who should
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.920]   we nominate for this committee? Let me think about that for a minute. Yeah, it should be,
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.280]   you know, Bob, that makes a good idea. Or when is that meeting? Oh, let me just check. Yeah,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.200]   it's Thursday, Thursday at four, boom, you give the answer. So in isolation, a question email is
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   not bad. It's why when someone sends a question email to you, they don't feel guilty about it.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.800]   Like this is a question. It's valid won't take them long to answer. The real pain point generated
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.200]   by question emails is in the context switching. This is what I talked about last week when I did
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.160]   the deep dive on the productive pause. I got into this a little bit more detail. But the real pain
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:47.760]   is switching your context so rapidly. So when you go from an email on when a meeting is to an email
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.360]   on who should be on the steering committee to an email on remind me again, what we thought we were
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.840]   gonna do for this client to an email for what do you want me to do next on this project. It's the
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:02.400]   context shift from one to the other. That is incredibly fatiguing. So when you have 20 emails
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   in a row that are largely questions like let me just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, it's not so
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.960]   easy. Because your mind has to completely switch context again and again. But it doesn't have time
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.800]   to do that because that can take five to 15 minutes. We've talked about that before. So what
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.720]   do you end up with is like a huge literal headache. And it's why the the friction builds to resistant
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   grows like I'm done with this, I got to get out of this inbox. It's the context switching cost.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.320]   So what do we do about question emails? Well, like I talked about in my productive pause,
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.840]   deep dive, one thing you can do is get these things out of your inbox, write them down in a text file,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.440]   you're transcribing them into a text file, line after line after line, sort them by category.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:51.440]   By category, I mean shares a similar context, scheduling things, this project, I'm working on
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:59.040]   things, etc. Then tackle each group by itself with a non trivial pause in between so that you take
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.720]   the time to get the context loaded for those questions, then you can go through really easily,
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:08.000]   the frictions gone, then walk away and do something else. Then come back and give yourself time to
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.520]   open up a new context for the new category and tackle those. So you're trying to really avoid
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   the friction of the the record scratch, screeching tires on pavement, 90 degree turn from one topic
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.360]   to another that really is going to strain your mind. Big picture, however, you want to reduce
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:33.200]   the question emails to the extent possible. So really pay attention. What are these emails I'm
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:39.680]   seeing? How can I get this information to the person who needs it without having to actually
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.840]   on my own initiate a context shift to the context relevant to this question and give it an answer.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.320]   That's gonna be a lot of different things depending on what you do. I mean, I can tell
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.520]   you, for example, as a professor, I really think through my process for how problem sets are written
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   and assigned and graded and handed back and how students are kept up to speed on what their grade
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.560]   is in the course and how we graded the things that we graded. And I actually put in a lot of time,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.320]   there's a lot of overhead in my systems. But you know what all of those systems are geared towards
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.120]   is preventing the students from having to just all the time send ad hoc questions, which they don't
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.960]   like. Because now they have to think of it, they have to remember it, they have to talk to the
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.640]   professor, they have to wait for the answer. And it prevents me from having a nonstop incoming
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.920]   stream of questions that are require a lot of context shifts. You can do this in almost any
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.960]   other area in your life. If you're a freelancer, there might be sender filters like I talked about
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.360]   in deep work where you direct people, okay, if you want to know about this, here's the answer.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:39.120]   If you want to do a meeting with me, go right here and set it up automatically. If you want a quote,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.920]   here are the 10 projects I do in the quote types, right? Like you up front, you put in the work,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.200]   they get enough information to that person that the question doesn't have to arrive
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.520]   ambiguously sitting there pregnant on your doorstep for you to have to deliver an answer.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.400]   So I'm a big believer in whatever processes, FAQs, or systems you can put in place
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.680]   to minimize the number of question emails to better because again, in isolation, they look
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.560]   innocent. What's the big deal about answering this question? The question is not the problem,
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.200]   it is switching my context to the context of that question. And it's one of 15 questions in a row I
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.920]   have to answer, each of which needs to switch. That's where you get the cognitive resistance.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.840]   That's where email becomes a burden. All right, let's get to the final type of email you're going
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.080]   to see in that inbox, which is conversational. This is one of the core arguments in my recent book,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.520]   A World Without Email, you need to read that book if you use email, slack, or any other communication
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   tool in your work, it's critical issue. But one of the big points I make in that book
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.040]   is that knowledge work is being strangled by the extent to which we are using back and forth ad hoc
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   unscheduled messaging to have conversations unfold. It makes a lot of sense in the moment.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.360]   Because the overhead in the moment could not possibly be lowered if I could just say,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:09.920]   "Hey, Cal, should we get together about the Johnson memo?" Send, boom, I'm done, seven seconds,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.520]   out of here. So in the moment, it seems like the easiest thing to do. But what have you just
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.920]   kicked off there? You may have just kicked off 10 back and forth messages. These messages are going
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.840]   to arrive at unpredictable times, but must be serviced quickly because we need to figure out
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.680]   what to do about the Johnson memo by tomorrow. Because Johnson himself is coming to the office,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.600]   and we got to have that figured out. So if we're going to get through 10 messages back and forth
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:44.640]   today, we're going to have to have a minimal latency between each message and its response.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.800]   Now, because I don't know when you're going to see the message and get back to me, I better keep
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.720]   checking my inbox to see, okay, did I hear back about the Johnson memo? Did I hear back about the
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.240]   Johnson memo? Now, let's say on average, I check the inbox about 10 times for each of the messages
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.920]   that comes in. Because I got to make sure I get it back, Johnson's coming. All right, well, those
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:12.320]   10 back and forth messages have just generated 100 context shifts. Each one of those context
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.840]   shifts has a cognitive tax, creates fatigue, reduces your capacity. That's one conversation.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.080]   Now, let's say there's seven different conversations this week that I have going
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.760]   back and forth with various people. 700 context shifts have just been generated by that. Again,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.080]   in the moment, you say seven seconds, "Hey, what about the Johnson memo? Should we meet
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.280]   send?" Boom, this is great. But this is part of what could be hundreds and hundreds of mind
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.320]   sapping context shifts that you have just accidentally initiated. So one of the big
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.880]   ideas in a world without email is that you need other ways of having these coordinating
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.920]   conversations happen that does not require unscheduled messages that need response.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:03.600]   You should be willing, you should be willing to have a large amount of overhead and annoyance
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.440]   and upfront time invested if that gets rid of unscheduled messages that require response.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:16.560]   It is worth it. I don't care if we have this setup where here's how it works. If we need to
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.960]   meet about memos, you have to go to the roof of my office building, and that access door is shut.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   So you have to get the ladder off the balcony on the third floor and scale three more floors on the
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.880]   outside of the building and get to the roof. And there on the roof, you need to start a fire and
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.040]   the smoke from that fire, I will see and that's how I will know to also get on that ladder on the
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.840]   third floor balcony, climb up to that roof and come find you so we can figure out there together
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.440]   when we're going to meet about the Johnson menu. That overhead is worth it. I would rather spend
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.240]   an hour doing that than do 100 context shifts spread out evenly over the next few days.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.920]   Now I'm being a little bit facetious there, but I'm trying to hit the point.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.520]   Time in the moment I could care less about what I care about is context shifts. How often do I have
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.360]   to check an inbox to keep this conversation going, and I will pay very large prices to make that
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.520]   number be very, very small. Now I get all into this in a world without email. There's three
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.880]   major types of different ways you can get these conversations out of back and forth conversations,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.080]   I'll just tease them. There's deferring those conversations using things like scheduling tools
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.400]   or office hours. There's automating those conversations by taking repeatable processes
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   and figuring out a set system for how they get done so I don't have to wait to hear from you to
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.840]   do things. And there's externalizing. Information goes to set places like task boards, discussions
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:48.560]   happen in set times with set formats like status meetings, etc, etc. Point being, conversations
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:54.320]   are killers. It seems innocent, it's not. Go to the roof and start a fire if you can, it's still
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.480]   much better than having to keep clicking there, waiting, waiting, waiting till you finally get
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.680]   the message that says now Wednesday is no good. How about Thursday? Come on. Alright, so if we're
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.600]   in tame email, let me just quickly summarize, you got to know what you're taming. It's a collection
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:14.400]   of broadcast questions and conversational messages. Each of these requires a different response,
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.560]   you should be working on responses to all three of these things. If you want to reduce that heavy,
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:32.720]   annoying, cognitively demanding footprint of email on your professional life.
