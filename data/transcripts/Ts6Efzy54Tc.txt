[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Most of you, I take it, remember that we are at the moment engaged in a consideration of
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.840]   the interpretation of the twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation. We have looked
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.360]   at the book in general as a part of our purpose of considering the biblical doctrine of the
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   second coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And last week we began a particular
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.720]   consideration of the message and the teaching of this twentieth chapter.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   Now what we did last week was to consider together what is probably the most popular
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.440]   and prevailing view of this chapter today, the so-called premillennial view of the return
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.200]   of our Lord. I spent the whole evening in putting that before you, in giving you an
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.960]   exposition of it, in stating it as a whole. There are minor differences of opinion amongst
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.400]   those who belong to that school of thought. We obviously cannot go into them all in detail,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200]   and indeed it would be quite profitless to do so. But we tried, therefore, to give you
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   a composite, general picture of what is believed and held by the majority.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   Now as we closed last Friday, I suggested to you that certain things were evident at
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.560]   once about that view. I also, you remember, gave you a brief history of the doctrine as
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.480]   to how it had been held at various times during the centuries of the history of the Christian
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.900]   Church. But we ended by saying that clearly this view implies and involves certain things.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.000]   It involves a literal interpretation of this chapter. It also involves us in teaching of
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.640]   at least two resurrections, and likewise it involves us in at least two judgments.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.400]   Well now then, I want to take up that idea. In other words, as I promised, I would like
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   to put before you, for your consideration, certain objections to that teaching. You see,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.520]   we have been adopting this method right away through in the consideration not only of this
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.360]   doctrine but of all the other doctrines. Nothing to me is more lamentable than that people
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.080]   should only know one view. Oftentimes they are not even aware of the fact that there
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.560]   is another possible view, and are not aware of the fact that the view they hold has only
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.040]   come into being, say, about a hundred years. We have tried, therefore, to put the possible
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.760]   views before you and give them the reasons for and against, in order that we may be in
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.480]   a position to arrive at a balanced judgment as the result of careful consideration of
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   these teachings and of prayer.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.400]   Very well then, let me now, having put the view before you, suggest to you certain criticisms
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.600]   of it. There are quite a number. Here is one which is a very important one, obviously.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.620]   It is a teaching which is found nowhere else in the Gospels or in the epistles of the New
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.720]   Testament. And that, of course, is agreed by all. There are no other references to this
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.080]   idea of an earthly kingdom with our Lord reigning in person on earth for a literal thousand
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:47.040]   years. There is no suggestion even of that anywhere else whatsoever in the New Testament.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.000]   It is here and in this chapter alone. Now that, of course, is obviously a very serious
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.440]   point. Surely, if you do believe in the unity of Scripture, you would believe, you must
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.760]   believe, that the Scripture acts as a whole, and that when this particular doctrine of
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.280]   our Lord's second coming is dealt with in other parts of the Scripture, well, if this
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.400]   earthly reign is an essential part of it, you would have thought that there would have
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.840]   been some suggestion or hint with regard to it, either in the teaching of our Lord himself
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   or else in the teaching of his apostles. But the fact is that there isn't. It is found
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.320]   the whole theory, the whole teaching is based solely upon this twentieth chapter of the
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.440]   book of the Revelation. That is one thing. Another thing is this, that this teaching
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:57.880]   makes the kingdom something earthly. Its emphasis is upon the earthly aspect of the kingdom,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:07.280]   this world, and our Lord reigning physically in the body here in this world. It is an earthly
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.040]   conception and in the descriptions, as I try to show you, of the glory of this earthly
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:22.240]   reign, they surpass one another in their attempts to paint its glory and its wonder. But still,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.200]   it is all earthly and involves something that is to happen here on earth. Whereas, you read
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   the Gospels and our Lord's own teaching about his kingdom, and you cannot but be struck
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.280]   by the fact that he constantly emphasizes the fact that it is spiritual. And you find
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.120]   the same emphasis in the epistles.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.560]   Now, let's be clear about this. We do believe, and I am going to try to show you that, that
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.440]   ultimately, as that third chapter of 2 Peter showed us at the beginning, ultimately there
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.840]   is going to be a new heavens and a new earth. Yes, but that is after this present one shall
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.600]   have been described in the manner that Peter there describes. Whereas, this earthly millennial
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.560]   reign talks about something that is to happen before that final end. And it is there, I
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:26.280]   say, that the conception of the kingdom is material and materialistic rather than spiritual.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:34.440]   Then another objection, it seems to me, is this one, that it postpones the idea of the
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.640]   kingdom to the future. They say this is the church age. And you remember I pointed out
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.880]   to you that they say that Christ is not king at the moment, he is only the head of the
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.640]   church. The kingdom, they say, is the entire future. He offered it when he was here in
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.440]   the world, it was rejected. Then there is this interregnum. And there is nothing, there
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.160]   is no kingdom now, they say. The kingdom is to come, and it will come during this millennial
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.640]   reign. Whereas, surely the scriptures themselves teach us that the kingdom is already present,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.080]   and that those of us who are Christians are already in the kingdom of God. Listen to John
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.220]   in the very first chapter of this book putting it like this. He says, "I, John, who also
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:29.360]   am your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ."
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.640]   Christians are already in the kingdom. The kingdom is to come in one sense, but the kingdom
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.440]   has come in another. And in any case, you remember constantly in the epistles, we know
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   that Christians are described as those who have been translated from the kingdom of darkness
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:56.000]   into the kingdom of God's dear Son. We are already citizens of the kingdom of God. Very
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.880]   well then, it seems to me therefore that to postpone the whole idea of the kingdom to
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:07.040]   the future is really to contradict the scripture. Then I come to another objection which to
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.360]   me is one of the most serious of all. That entire view which tells us that not only will
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.040]   our Lord here reign for a thousand years in the flesh, but that the Jews will be given
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:27.520]   a great position of preeminence and so on, here is something which is very serious. For
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:38.480]   it again introduces, reintroduces that distinction between Jews and Gentiles which surely has
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.760]   been abolished. There was nothing that the Apostle Paul in particular so gloried in as
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:52.160]   that there is no longer Jew nor Gentile, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. The middle wall
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:59.560]   of partition has been broken down. The kingdom is now open to Gentiles as to Jews. The whole
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.040]   glory of the gospel says Paul in the epistle to the Ephesians is that the Gentiles are
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.320]   to be fellow heirs and fellow citizens in this glorious kingdom of God and of Christ.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:21.000]   But here is a teaching that reintroduces a vital distinction between Jew and Gentile
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.240]   which they say is going to last throughout the whole of eternity. I find it, I must confess,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.120]   quite impossible to believe that. I would have thought that the eleventh chapter of
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.000]   Romans which we considered weeks and months ago would be enough in and of itself. There
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   is only one olive tree. Old Testament and new, it is the one olive tree. The Jews were
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.120]   the natural branches. They have been cut off. The others have been grafted in but into the
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.520]   same olive tree. And the Jews are grafted in again when they become Christians. There
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.480]   is only one olive tree. There is no permanent distinction for all eternity between Jew and
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.160]   Gentile. That is gone once and forever. "The kingdom shall be taken from you," said our
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.920]   Lord to the Jews, "and given unto a nation bearing forth the fruits thereof." That is
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.640]   the church and that is the form of the kingdom of God at the present time.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.040]   The New Testament teaching is that all nations and tribes and tongues are to be in this kingdom.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:34.720]   This book of Revelation teaches that. And indeed there is no suspicion of any difference
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.400]   between the Jew and the Gentile even in this twentieth chapter itself. As I am going to
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.360]   point out to you later, Jews are not mentioned at all here. There is no mention of Jews nor
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.400]   Gentiles. So that it is something that is imported into the chapter which really has
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   no place there at all and is at the same time a contradiction of the general teaching of
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.280]   the whole of the New Testament.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:06.800]   Then another point, of course, is that that idea teaches, as I have already suggested,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.760]   several comings of our Lord. It seems that there are to be at any rate at least three
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.440]   comings according to that view. If you believe in the preliminary rapture, there will be
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.840]   three; if you do not, there are at least two. Whereas, surely, the whole of the remainder
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:34.200]   of the New Testament teaches that there is only to be one second coming of our Lord,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:43.840]   the one that will be associated with the general resurrection of the dead and the final judgment.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:51.000]   There is the evidence for more than one coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now we have considered
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.960]   the argument as based on 1 Thessalonians 4 and 2 Thessalonians 2 already, but here again
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.400]   we have to mention it.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.480]   So let me come to something which we have not dealt with so much. This view also teaches,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:17.520]   as we saw last week, that there are also at least two resurrections, if not three. If
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.520]   you hold the preliminary rapture view, there are three resurrections. But if you do not
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.400]   hold that view and are a premillennialist, well, then there are two at any rate. And
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.880]   that there will be an interval of a thousand years at least between the resurrection of
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:40.520]   the good people and the resurrection of the bad people. That is the teaching, you remember.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.760]   That the good, the believers, the Christians, they will be raised before the commencement
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.120]   or at the beginning of the thousand years reign, but that the unbelievers and the bad
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:59.160]   and the sinners will not be raised until the end of that period and even a little beyond
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   that.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.640]   Now, here is something, of course, which again is of vital importance, for it seems
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.480]   to me that this teaching comes into direct collision and is a direct contradiction of
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   the teaching of our Lord and Saviour himself. Listen to what he says in John 5, verses 28
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.560]   and 29. "Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:37.240]   shall hear his voice and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:44.400]   of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation." Where is
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.920]   the interval of a thousand years? Surely that is a perfectly clear statement. There is to
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:59.080]   be one general resurrection, good and bad together, and that is to be their faith. So
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:04.720]   that there our Lord clearly teaches that the good and the bad will rise together and at
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.500]   the same time.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.480]   But then if you go on to the next chapter of John's Gospel, chapter 6, you will find
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.560]   that our Lord himself teaches that both the good and the bad are to be raised at the last
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.080]   day. Not at the beginning of some millennial period, but at the very end, the very last
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:31.320]   day. Now our Lord goes on repeating this. In the sixth chapter of John's Gospel, first
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:38.280]   you find it in verse 39. Listen. "This is the Father's will which hath sent me, that
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:45.680]   of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:53.160]   last day." There is nothing after the last day. The last day is the last day, and he
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.320]   is going to raise those whom the Father has given him, the good, the believers, the Christians,
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:06.720]   at the last day and not before. Then you will find that he repeats this in verse 40, in
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:12.080]   verse 44, and in verse 54.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.680]   Now these are the words of our blessed Lord and Saviour himself, that he is going to raise
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:24.040]   his own at that last day. And you will find exactly the same thing in the eleventh chapter
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:32.320]   of John's Gospel, in verse 24. Martha says, "I know that he shall rise again in the
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:40.400]   resurrection at the last day." That was the teaching, and our Lord adopted and used
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:49.600]   that current teaching. So it seems to me that to say that there are two resurrections with
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.440]   an interval of over a thousand years between them, and that there is the same interval
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:01.240]   between the rising of the good and the bad, it seems to me that it is just a sheer contradiction
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.600]   of what our Lord plainly teaches, and which is indeed the teaching everywhere in the New
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:15.560]   Testament with regard to the resurrection and the last day and the final judgment.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:23.680]   Then coming to another objection. Here is something surely that should constitute for
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:30.080]   the minds of all of us a very real difficulty. And there are many who hold this view, which
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.240]   we are now considering and criticizing, who admit quite frankly that it is a difficulty
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:42.920]   to them. If their teaching is right, well then you are confronted with this, that at
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:52.800]   one and the same time there will be on the earth glorified saints—I mean by that people
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.360]   who have died as Christians, who will have been raised from the dead, and whose bodies
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.000]   will have been changed and will have been glorified. There will be on the earth at the
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.240]   same time saints in their glorified bodies and other people who are still in the flesh,
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:17.960]   living together. Now, I find it impossible to conceive of that, that at one and the same
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.360]   time you should have that, and indeed add to that, the presence of the Lord himself
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.440]   in all his glory. You remember what happened to Saul of Tarsus when he had just a glimpse
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:34.280]   of him. He fell on his back to the ground, and yet we are told that there will be people
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.920]   in the flesh who shall not only see him, but will be living with men and women changed
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   and like him, whose bodies will have been fashioned like unto his glorious body, and
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.920]   all living together on the earth at the same time. It surely is a most serious difficulty
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:01.400]   with regard to that view. And another thing that seems to follow is this, that surely
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.360]   there must be some on the earth who are still sinners during this supposed glorious period.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:16.000]   I say that for this reason. If there are not sinners left, well then, how can it possibly
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.960]   come to pass that the things described in verses 8 and 9 of this twentieth chapter can
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:26.440]   never take place? We are told that when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:31.160]   loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:37.760]   quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of whom
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   is as the sand of the sea. Are we asked to believe that Satan, by one stroke as it were,
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.280]   can suddenly turn this tremendous multitude that is as numerous as the sand of the sea
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:59.440]   in this world into enemies of Christ? No, the suggestion surely must be that they were
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.520]   more or less enemies the whole time, and that their sin was merely held in a condition of
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:12.800]   restraint so that the period is not as glorious as our friends would have us understand. But
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.840]   not only that, here is another of those to me insuperable obstacles. Is it conceivable
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:28.960]   that after our blessed Lord and Savior has been living and reigning in this world for
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:35.640]   a thousand years, not now as the carpenter of Nazareth, remember, but as the King of
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   kings and Lord of lords, in all his heavenly glory and with his limitless power? Is it
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.600]   conceivable that after a thousand years of that, Satan, as it were, in the twinkling
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.960]   of an eye, can suddenly produce these hordes, masses of people all over the world, as numerous
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:04.200]   as the sand of the sea, to fight Christ and to be bitterly and violently opposed to him?
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:12.680]   Surely it is straining imagination, leave alone thought, to ask us to believe that such
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:21.000]   a thing is possible at all. It is just unthinkable, and yet it is an essential part of that whole
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.880]   view which goes by the name of Chileism or by the pre-millennial name.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.640]   Now there are a number of objections, but now let us turn for a moment to that chapter
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:38.440]   we read at the beginning, where it seems to me that the objections are more or less gathered
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:48.520]   together for us in a very convenient manner. Now you notice that in that third chapter
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:58.120]   of the second epistle of Peter, we are told certain things quite plainly and explicitly.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:05.200]   There is no hint or suggestion at all there, of course, of any millennial reign. Peter
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   was writing to comfort these Christian people. They were being bothered by these scoffers
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.080]   who said, "Look here, you people say, and you have been saying it now for a number of
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.760]   years, that this King of yours, this Christ of yours, is going to come back. Where is
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:25.640]   the promise of his coming? Look around you, they say, everything is carrying on as it
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.800]   has always been. There is no sign of it at all. This is all nonsense, they say. It is
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:35.080]   a figment of your imaginations. You have been fooled." Peter writes to comfort those people
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:43.720]   on that very point. But there is not a word here about any millennial reign. No, no, all
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.840]   Peter tells us here is this. There is not a suspicion or a suggestion about a period
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.720]   during which sin is going to be kept in check and under restraint, not at all. All that
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:02.880]   Peter knows is this, that the day of the Lord is going to introduce that great conflagration
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.960]   which is going to mean the destruction of the world as we now know it. Evil and sin
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:15.720]   are going to be burnt right out of it. "The heavens and the earth, which are now by the
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:23.600]   same word, are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:30.240]   of ungodly men." It all happens at the same time. That is all Peter knows about.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.120]   And then the coming of the new heavens and the new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.400]   Nothing whatsoever about this millennial reign. And as he indicates, there is none either
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.720]   in the writings of Paul. He refers, you remember, to the writings of his beloved brother Paul,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:52.680]   who is dealing with these very selfsame questions. And there is not the nearest hint of it anywhere
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:23:00.040]   in the epistles of the great apostle. Not only that, you notice this. Peter says, "But
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:07.400]   the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night." This day, when the world that
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:15.200]   now is, is going to be burnt up with fire, says Peter, which will mean the end of all
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.840]   as we know it now, and then there will be the introduction of this new heavens and new
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:27.560]   earth. All that, says Peter, is going to come as a thief in the night. But how can it come
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:33.640]   as a thief in the night if it has been preceded by a thousand years of Christ's presence
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:39.040]   in his glorified body here on the face of the earth? It cannot come as a thief in the
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.160]   night then. The millennium itself will have warned us for a thousand years that it is
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.360]   going to come, and we will all be waiting for it. We will have gone through the millennium,
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.120]   there will be the little season when Satan is set free, and we will know that Christ's
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:24:00.200]   this day of the Lord is at hand. So it cannot come any longer as a thief in the night.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.920]   You see, the teaching directly contradicts the teaching of this important chapter. Not
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.360]   only that, we are told quite plainly here what we are to look forward to. We are to
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:20.400]   look forward to this day which is coming, this day which will not only be the day when
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:26.320]   the heavens and the earth shall be burnt by fire, but it is at the same time to be the
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:37.160]   day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. In other words, we are exhorted by the apostle
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:44.200]   to look forward to the one and only second coming of the Lord, which will also be the
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:50.640]   day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men, which will also be the day of this great conflagration
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.680]   when the elements will melt with fervent heat, etc., and the world will be destroyed as we
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:03.360]   now know it. So that surely, apart from anything else, this
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:11.760]   third chapter of 2 Peter ought to be sufficient in and of itself to cause us to question most
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:20.040]   seriously this teaching which would interpret the twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.680]   in that particular way. But now let me put before you certain objections
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.440]   which arise from the chapter itself. I have so far been dealing with what I would call
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:38.560]   general objections from the analogy of Scripture, and we are always to compare Scripture with
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.880]   Scripture. You see, the apostle Peter there, you remember, in that same chapter tells us
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.560]   that there are certain people who rest the writings of the apostle Paul to their own
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.820]   destruction. They are unlearned and they are unstable. They are ready to believe anything
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.880]   that is told them. They have not got a real knowledge of the Scripture. Well, I say we
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.320]   avoid that by growing in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord. We compare Scripture
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:09.720]   with Scripture. Scripture is one, and we must never interpret any one passage in such a
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.760]   way as to produce a blank contradiction to the teaching of other passages. That is the
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.240]   rule by which we are working. So now, having done it in general, come back
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:27.920]   to the chapter itself. There are, it seems to me, certain objections to this view of
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:38.600]   the chapter in the chapter itself. Now, let me put the first one in this way. Surely,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:44.640]   as you read this chapter, you must come to the conclusion that the scene depicted by
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:52.840]   John, by the seer, is not on earth at all. It is a scene in heaven. "And I saw an
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   angel come down from heaven." You go back through the book and you find that he starts
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   most of his fresh sections in some such way as that "and I saw." And here, he is looking
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:13.560]   into heaven and he sees an angel coming down from heaven. Surely, the scene is in heaven,
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:22.120]   but let me support that argument by this. He says in verse 4, "And I saw thrones."
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:30.800]   Now as you read through this book of Revelation, you will find a number of references to thrones,
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:39.960]   and without a single exception, you will find every time that the thrones are in heaven.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.280]   Not on earth, they are thrones in heaven. Go through the book for yourselves and make
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.680]   a list, make a note of all the references to thrones, and you will find invariably that
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:58.840]   the thrones are in heaven. Very well then, that should cause us to pause, but add to
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:05.960]   that what I have already said this evening. There is not a single reference to earth in
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:13.680]   this chapter, still less is there a reference to Palestine. Jerusalem is not mentioned at
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:21.520]   all. The Jews simply do not figure here in any sense. And yet you see that interpretation
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:29.000]   which we are considering puts in the very center earth, Palestine, rebuilt Jerusalem,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.880]   and the temple, and the Jews in a position of preeminence. There is not a suggestion
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:41.040]   of it here at all. You read this chapter, and there is nothing whatsoever that should
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.560]   lead you to think of any one of such objects. And of course, the friends who hold the view
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.800]   admit that that is so. "Well, where do they get it from?" you say. Ah, well, you see
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.960]   they have to say, "Ah, we get that in the Old Testament. We get those prophecies which
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.080]   say about this glorious time that is coming." And they say, "It must be here." So they
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:09.160]   put it in here. But the question is, does John put it in there? Is there even a suspicion
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:14.280]   of a suggestion that it is meant to be here? I suggest to you that in the whole of this
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.040]   book there is nothing—I mean the book of Revelation—there is nothing which suggests
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:29.560]   earth or Palestine or Jews whatsoever. The scene is in heaven.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:35.080]   Then another thing. We read in that first verse, "I saw an angel come down from heaven
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.760]   having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:47.320]   on the dragon, that old serpent which is the devil, and bound him a thousand years."
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:55.880]   Now, even the friends who hold this premillennial view, they are prepared to admit and to agree
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:04.640]   that all this about the chain is obviously symbolical. Satan, after all, is a spirit.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.000]   Satan is a spirit. And they know that and they agree with that and therefore they say,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.440]   "Well, we've got to admit and we've got to agree that this talk about the chain must
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.680]   be interpreted symbolically because Satan is a spirit." So they grant that that must
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:28.240]   be interpreted symbolically. But from there on they reject the symbolical interpretation.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:37.440]   Now, surely that's inconsistent. Surely everything we are dealing with here is symbolic.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.480]   And the way of true interpretation is not that which has to pick and choose in this
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.440]   way and do it for the sake of the convenience of a theory. If the book starts in—if this
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.120]   chapter starts in this symbolical manner, why shouldn't it continue in the same manner?
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.280]   In other words, I would put this point to you. The numbers in this book, as we have
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:06.480]   seen many times, are obviously symbolical numbers. We've looked at a number of them.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:13.800]   And surely the same thing applies here. This number thousand, as we've seen, is a most
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:20.960]   important symbolical number. It suggests a period of completeness, a whole period, a
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:28.640]   long period, yes, but above all a complete period, ten cubed. We've seen that elsewhere.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.160]   There are many uses of the word thousand in this book of Revelation. Turn them up again
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:40.120]   for yourselves and you'll see that it's always used and done in a symbolical manner.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:46.200]   Why should we suddenly literalize it here? When it has been symbolical right through,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:52.120]   why does it suddenly become literal at this point?
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:58.960]   Then another, to me, very important point is this, again in verse four. "And I saw
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:08.840]   thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them." Then listen. "And
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:17.560]   I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus." You notice he
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.200]   says deliberately that he saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:31.520]   Jesus, which surely suggests this, that they were in a disembodied state. He does not say
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:37.960]   that he saw those who had been beheaded for the witness of Jesus raised and in their glorified
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.400]   bodies. If he meant that, why didn't he say that? But he doesn't say that. He says
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400]   he saw their souls.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:51.000]   "Ah, but you see, often in the Scriptures, men and women in the flesh are referred to
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.160]   as souls. We are told of the number of the children of Israel that went down from Canaan
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.320]   to Egypt, that they were a given number of souls." I know. That is done sometimes.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   People are described as souls, that there were seventy souls or something like that.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:16.480]   But you notice that here we cannot adopt that explanation for this reason. He says the souls
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.660]   of them. If he had only said souls, well then that would have been a possible explanation.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:29.240]   But he says the souls of them. There are the persons in the them. And he says, "I saw
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:36.040]   the souls of the persons." If a man says to me that he has seen the soul of a person,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.880]   I can only draw one conclusion, that he hasn't seen the body of that person. Otherwise, why
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.000]   doesn't he say, "I saw the person"? Why doesn't he just say, "I saw them"? But
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.160]   he says, "I saw the souls of them." In other words, you see, it all suggests that
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:57.600]   the scene is in heaven, where the departed souls are, of those who are in Christ and
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:04.000]   who have been true and faithful and have suffered for the witness and the testimony of Jesus.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.400]   So this is a very vital point, surely, in the chapter itself. The writer deliberately
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:17.640]   chooses the word "souls." And he obviously must have some very good and cogent reason
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.520]   for doing so.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.920]   Then another point which strikes anyone reading this chapter without presuppositions must
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:38.080]   be this. That this period of a thousand years, whatever the interpretation of it may be,
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.840]   is obviously something that precedes the final judgment. Because you don't come to the
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:52.400]   final judgment in this twentieth chapter until you come to verses eleven and twelve, where
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.600]   we read, "And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.360]   earth and the heaven fled away." How reminiscent of 2 Peter 3, isn't it? It's almost exactly
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.600]   the same thing. "From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.080]   were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:27.400]   judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works."
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.040]   And he goes on to say, "The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.920]   delivered up the dead that were in them. And they were judged, every man, according to
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:50.640]   their works." Now, that's the final judgment. And you see that here, it comes after this
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:36:01.560]   period, after this three thousand years. And therefore it involves that teaching in the
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:09.160]   most serious, not to say impossible, difficulties, because they have to reverse that. Whereas
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:15.960]   the chapter itself clearly puts the period of a thousand years, whatever it may be, before
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:22.240]   this final judgment. And you see at the same time, the chapter is not only in line with
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:30.160]   the second epistle of Peter, the third chapter, it is equally in line with Romans 8, with
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.680]   this great teaching, you remember, about the creature being made subject to bondage, not
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:42.680]   willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope. Listen, "Because the creature
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:49.560]   itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.200]   the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:00.440]   pain together until now." Don't forget that here again Paul is comforting people who are
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:05.000]   having a hard and a difficult and a trying time. And the comfort he holds out for them
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.440]   is not that this is going to be a glorious period of a thousand years reigned with Christ
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.840]   on earth. No, no. He says the thing we are looking forward to is this, "The whole creation
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:23.680]   groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." And not only they, but ourselves also,
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:30.440]   which have the first fruits of the Spirit, we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.600]   for what? For the millennial reign? No, for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:46.360]   body. And it is all put in terms of this final condition when the whole of creation will
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:53.520]   have been rid of evil and of sin by this conflagration which is coming, and the new heavens and the
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:00.360]   new earth will have been ushered in wherein dwelleth righteousness. And again in Acts,
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.560]   in the third chapter of the book of Acts, in the twenty-first verse, you get a reference
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:11.600]   to the same thing. Peter, preaching after the healing of that lame man, you remember,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.080]   really talks about this same period, this regeneration that is coming, this great period
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:25.280]   of refreshing. And that brings me to the last of these particular objections which I find
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:36.880]   in the chapter itself to this interpretation, which is this, that surely this interpretation
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:46.780]   presses its interpretation of what is meant by the binding of Satan for a thousand years,
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:52.640]   it presses it too far. We are told that he laid hold of the dragon, the angel laid hold
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.600]   of the dragon, that old serpent which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:04.040]   years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:13.280]   that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.560]   Now I say that if you press the interpretation of that to me, that there will be no evidence
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:27.840]   of sin and evil at all in this world during that great period, well then, as I have already
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:35.480]   indicated, you are put into terrible difficulties in explaining how it comes to pass that Satan
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:44.920]   so easily, at the end of the thousand years, is able to persuade so many people, so many
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:52.160]   indeed that it looks as if the Church and Christ alone was going to be overwhelmed,
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:58.440]   and that it was necessary that there should be fire coming down out of heaven sent by
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:06.920]   God to devour them and to destroy them in order to save Christ and his people.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:16.120]   Well very well, there it seems to me are the objections to that premillennial interpretation
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:23.160]   of this twentieth chapter of the book of Revelation. I indicated last Friday that there are two
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:31.440]   other possible interpretations, and it remains for us to consider them. I hope therefore
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:37.960]   next Friday, God willing, to consider with you what is called the postmillennial view.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.640]   We have been dealing with the premillennial. We will look at the postmillennial view. That
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:53.120]   should not take us very long. And then, having done that, I should like to give you a positive
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:41:00.800]   interpretation of this chapter, which is symbolical, which is spiritual, which is in line with
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:07.080]   our interpretation in general of the whole of the book, which we have already considered,
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:12.880]   is in line with our understanding of those prophecies of Daniel and of the various other
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.960]   prophecies of the New Testament, which we have already considered.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:24.080]   Now that is our program. I hope to do those two things next Friday evening, and then that
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.640]   will enable us to make a final statement about this question of the time of our Lord's coming,
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:37.080]   and will lead us on to a brief consideration of the doctrine of the resurrection and the
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:47.800]   last ultimate state of glory in which we who belong to the Lord shall spend our eternity.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.560]   Let us pray.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:42:01.600]   Our heavenly Father, we again come before thee. And we come to acknowledge not only
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:10.760]   our own weakness and unworthiness and frailty. We come to acknowledge our indolence and our
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:18.680]   failure to read and to study thy word as we ought. But, O God, we come also to thank thee
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:25.000]   and to bless and praise thy name for all that thou hast provided for us. O God, give us
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.920]   grace, we pray thee, and light by thy Spirit, that as we again consider these things and
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:38.800]   reflect upon what we have considered tonight, that we may have understanding. And grant,
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:47.120]   O God, that we all may have but one great idea, and that is not to prove that we are
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:54.160]   right or that others are wrong, but that we may see what thou hast planned for us and
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:03.080]   for the world. That we may look for this great day that is coming and ask ourselves the question,
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:12.400]   what sort of people should we be hastening unto and looking for the coming of this great
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:19.080]   day of thine? O Lord, we pray thee, therefore, that we may have the strength and the power
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:26.560]   necessary that we may grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord, so that we may
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:34.200]   be worthy of thee now. And when the great day comes, as a thief in the night, we shall
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:44.920]   not be found unprepared. Lord, bless us to that end and pardon and forgive all the imperfections
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:53.080]   of our service. We ask it pleading nothing but the name and the merit of thy dear Son,
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:44:00.120]   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:06.960]   the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:18.000]   with us now throughout the remainder of this our short uncertain life and earthly pilgrimage
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:29.560]   and until the day comes and we shall see him face to face. Amen.
