[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.180]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.420]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.440]   Today, Jesse, Troy and I sit down
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.140]   and talk about this tough economy
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.580]   and its impact on employment
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.740]   and small businesses who are struggling to survive
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.420]   because customers' budgets are now more guarded than ever.
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.180]   We talk about the lessons we've learned
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.780]   and some key takeaways.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.220]   All right, let's get started.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.620]   - My dad once said to me,
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.160]   "Don't ever think you're unreplaceable."
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180]   And it seemed like a cold thing to say
[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.980]   because he said that to me during a time
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.680]   where I was at the company, I was at a peak,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.580]   and thinking I'm so valuable.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.260]   And I think it was you who said earlier, Troy,
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.700]   that there is a business side of things
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.220]   and some things you have control over,
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.100]   some things you don't.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.900]   And some of those factors are dictated
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.180]   by macroeconomic economics, right?
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180]   Which might impact your employment.
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.900]   And it's a very cold thing to say,
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.900]   but it helped me separate work life from personal life.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.100]   And this is not to say that you're unloyal to a company,
[00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920]   but it's realizing that end of the day,
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.100]   you are still a number.
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.740]   And so some of these decisions around employment,
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.460]   especially in this current economic state,
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700]   it's not personal.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.860]   And it's hard being the recipient of that.
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620]   And I think maybe this is a good time
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.660]   to maybe shift to dealing with unemployment, right?
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.340]   'Cause I've gone through it twice.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.780]   There are two periods of my time where I was doing that.
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.860]   And right now, a lot of people are doing it,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.860]   dealing with it, as you mentioned, Jesse, from the pandemic.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.100]   My first time was after the agency.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.060]   And the question is,
[00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.240]   what do you do during your time of employment?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.260]   And the complexity multiplies.
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.900]   Like if you have kids, if you have mortgage,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.740]   or if you're in need of health insurance for yourself,
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.180]   or if you're covering aging parents, right?
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.740]   So like the complexity and a need for income
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.340]   just builds and builds and builds.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.580]   And that stress and anxiety, it impacts you.
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.660]   When my first instance of unemployment
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.580]   after the agency, before Logitech,
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.380]   my mindset was, I'm gonna hit the ground running.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.860]   I'm gonna hit as many jobs as I possibly can.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.260]   And that would be similar
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.100]   to what I would have experienced today, right?
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.260]   Where it's like, I'm gonna go through all of the,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.180]   I'm gonna file unemployment.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.580]   You guys have to do that.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.180]   It doesn't matter how senior your job is.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.580]   The amount you get is based on a percentage
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.580]   of your last paycheck.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460]   And so if you're a VP,
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.260]   or if you're an individual contributor,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.620]   like file for unemployment.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860]   Now you may get rejected.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.900]   In some cases it's happened,
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.580]   but if you don't apply, then you'll never get it, right?
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.500]   So I played for unemployment.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.540]   I had a mortgage at the time.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.500]   So I did was I went through the California state,
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.540]   the job listings held by the government.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.220]   And every day I was doing job searches, right?
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.540]   And in order to maintain your unemployment status,
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.300]   you have to provide a log of the proves
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.780]   that you've been job searching, right?
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.020]   And so whether it's submitting through your site
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.340]   or whatnot, you always had to provide a record of that.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.340]   And remember at that time,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.980]   I had so many random odd jobs.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.100]   And it was important because it made me realize
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.820]   that no job is ever beneath me.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.060]   Doesn't matter if I am doing VP level work,
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.700]   if I'm doing barista work,
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.980]   nothing is invaluable
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.100]   if you know what you wanna get out of the experience.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.780]   And I think that was a first time work.
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.500]   Again, coming out of the agency experience,
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.900]   I'm struggling with my sense of identity.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.220]   So I was retrying to build myself.
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.780]   And so I made it a goal to take every opportunity
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.580]   and all of them were temporary jobs.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.300]   And in one case it was like,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.580]   I'm gonna learn how to deal with rejection.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.700]   So one of those temp jobs was all around cold calling.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.980]   I had a job around, I type fast,
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.980]   but sometimes at that point, maybe accuracy,
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.300]   maybe like 80%, let's say.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.140]   And I'm much higher now.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.300]   But so my goal for that was I had data entry job.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.580]   So I was like, my goal is to bang out
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.020]   however it works per minute
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.940]   and I'll have like 95% accuracy
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.620]   'cause it's a measurable way to show improvement.
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.540]   I did all these oddball jobs.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.540]   I took a lot of volunteer work from nonprofits,
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.380]   from my local church, wherever it is.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.260]   And the whole point of that was
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.380]   the next time I go into an interview,
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.740]   the best way for me to help them understand who I am
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.820]   and who they're trying to hire
[00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.260]   is to help them understand my mindset
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.740]   through this whole thing.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.860]   So it's a story of resilience.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.020]   It's about being scrappy.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.940]   It's around finding purpose in any work
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.740]   and proving through examples
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.460]   that I can make meaningful gain
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.460]   on either skillset building or whatever it is.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.860]   And that actually helped me land the contract job
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.780]   at Logitech because I was able to demonstrate scrappiness.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.140]   And at that time, the web team,
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.780]   they're about to go through a site redesign.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.180]   And so I was able to kind of pull that together.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.420]   The most recent unemployment I had was a little different
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.180]   'cause I was so burnt out from the previous experience
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.500]   that I just, I gave myself a month
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.180]   to just recharge and relax, man, honestly.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.980]   I knew that the economy was tough
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.140]   and I was taking a huge risk
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.820]   by giving myself time to breathe.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.820]   But in this instance, I knew that if I couldn't recharge
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.780]   in all the interviews I do,
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.540]   they would not get the best version of me.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.140]   And thankfully in this scenario,
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.700]   my wife and I both work.
[00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.340]   Now, single-based income out of California,
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.300]   it would only get us so far.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.420]   And so how we processed that was
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.060]   we looked at our finances between mortgage,
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.540]   any debts that we owed, unemployment,
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.420]   and then her income.
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.220]   And we calculated how much runway we would have.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.100]   And of course we ate very conservatively.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.140]   So that's how I was able to calculate
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.820]   I have a month maximum.
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.340]   After that, I really needed to get myself together.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.860]   So that's how I got myself
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.300]   through this current pandemic unemployment.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.020]   Leveraging connections was really, really important.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.340]   And actually landing my job at Fortinet,
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.580]   it was fortuitous because my hiring manager
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.260]   reached out to me prior to joining A10,
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.140]   which is my previous job.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.300]   So two jobs ago, he reached out to me
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.140]   and it just didn't line up.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.660]   And so I had sent out,
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.740]   actually this whole podcast actually wouldn't have happened
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.580]   if I wasn't unemployed.
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.940]   I'm actually talking about like silver linings.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.660]   'Cause at that time I put out a message on LinkedIn.
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.220]   Hey, look, I'm unemployed,
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.460]   but I'm just trying to help people.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.660]   So let's have a conversation if you need a sounding board.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.860]   So that message resonated with a lot of hiring managers.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.860]   And so I put myself out there.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.860]   And one of those conversations just happened to be
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.420]   with my current hiring manager.
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.300]   And that kind of turned things around.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.140]   How about you guys?
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.060]   Like, what are, you know,
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.500]   obviously you guys are running your own businesses.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.540]   And so there's periods of like hyper growth
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.300]   and periods of slowdown and you are your own manager.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.180]   Hopefully you're a good manager to yourself.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.140]   How are you dealing with all of that,
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.740]   especially with today's climate?
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.740]   - I mean, there's definitely ebbs and flows.
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.420]   It's funny, as my own manager,
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.220]   I'm pretty bad about finding time for business development,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.140]   but I've been pretty fortunate that my network just kind of,
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   when things slow, things tend to come back.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.620]   But the one thing I would say, like,
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.140]   I wish I had, going back earlier in my career,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.380]   I had two periods of unemployment.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.380]   One was self-induced.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.380]   I walked out of a PR agency during the original .com bust,
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.620]   which was the worst time to walk out
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.660]   because things were getting really hard for me.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.540]   And I was so immature at that point.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.580]   I just couldn't, I couldn't deal with it.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.620]   And the second was that period I mentioned
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.580]   where I already had sort of wheels in motion.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.140]   But that first period, I wasted a lot of time
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.980]   basically procrastinating on doing
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.940]   what I should have been doing every day.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.660]   Should have been looking for job opportunities or resumes.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.700]   But the one thing I wish, if I could go back now,
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.700]   I would say schedule two to three things per day
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.540]   that push you toward finding the next job,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.060]   but equally as important, schedule something,
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.780]   schedule a period of time to do something
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.180]   that is something you're passionate about,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.740]   to sort of give yourself a break,
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.980]   but also clear your head a little bit.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.380]   Like if this were to happen to me today,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.540]   that thing would be disc golf.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.740]   I'm really into disc golf right now.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.420]   And so when my business is slow today,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.660]   if I have a day where I don't have a full slate
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.620]   of jobs to do, then I will go out to the disc golf
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.940]   and I'll throw some discs.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.420]   So I also gave advice recently to a family member
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.740]   who's trying to make the transitions.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.580]   He was kind of unsure of where to start.
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.540]   And I think the advice was just find one thing per day
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.900]   to do while you're in your current job
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.740]   to find the next thing,
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.580]   which is reach out to somebody in your network
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.980]   that you haven't connected with for a long time,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.740]   or find five jobs online through a search
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.820]   that you want to apply for,
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.780]   but then you can apply for them a different day,
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.900]   but just identify opportunities.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.300]   Just do one thing per day.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.540]   And I think during unemployment,
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.580]   if you can mix those two things,
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.860]   finding time for yourself,
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.740]   do something that moves you forward.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.220]   I think you're going to feel good
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.260]   about what you did at the end of the day.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.580]   - Yeah, I would agree.
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.780]   I think it's so important to have that balance, right?
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.580]   To have those things outside of work that fulfill us
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.420]   and fill the well back up.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.740]   And I've had some periods of unemployment.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.740]   Ironically, one was I was laid off on my 30th birthday.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.740]   It was August 11th, 2001.
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.580]   And 30 days later,
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.500]   there's obviously the big terrorist attack.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.820]   And I lived in LA at the time,
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.980]   and there was all this hysteria around the mail.
[00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.700]   I don't know if you remember the anthrax scare
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.660]   and all this stuff.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.740]   And so I had been working at the LA Times
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.580]   for a number of years,
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.420]   and I got laid off, like I said, in August, 2001.
[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.220]   And it was a while before I found a freelance job.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.540]   And I had been freelancing as a copywriter
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.140]   for an agency doing Hollywood, doing movie taglines.
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.260]   But I really didn't, and it was a great book,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.820]   but I didn't know what to do with it.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.500]   I didn't really even know what agencies did.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.060]   I just kind of fell into this role
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.420]   'cause I had picked up a job editing a literary journal
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   that happened to be produced by this partner in an agency.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.660]   And I had talked my way, argued my way out of that job
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.460]   because they accepted a couple awards in my name
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.300]   and didn't tell me about it.
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.180]   And I got all huffy, and then I never worked for them again.
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.620]   And so I didn't have that job.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.300]   I lost my full-time job.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.180]   I didn't really a freelancer at the time,
[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.820]   but I ended up picking up this work
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.340]   for a company that was another import/export company.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.340]   They had me writing campaigns for gift baskets
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.820]   and a pill that would make you slimmer and tanner
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.740]   at the same time.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.540]   And it was sort of a mess.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.500]   This was, but I got an employment for a period of time
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.700]   just like you described, Tim, is you just have to go out,
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.420]   you have to report all the jobs you've looked for.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.500]   And then if you had any work,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.980]   you have to report the hours that you have.
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.060]   And it's sort of related to what they give you.
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.980]   And it wasn't a lot of money.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.060]   And then we moved, my wife and I moved,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.500]   at the time we had yet to be married,
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.620]   we moved to Santa Cruz where she started attending school.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.660]   And it was rough.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.540]   I think it was just a matter of taking,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.540]   like you said, any job.
[00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.900]   I took a job when we moved to Santa Cruz selling coffee.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.260]   And this was at the dot-com bust
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.940]   happened right about that time.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   And the, so I was selling condiments like coffee,
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:06.100]   not condiments, but coffee, snacks,
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.060]   and things like that in Silicon Valley
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.780]   to these office, you know, to offices,
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.300]   to folks that previously had been good customers
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.100]   and maybe they had shrunk.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.660]   So it was really hard.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.020]   I did that for a few years.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.100]   And then I got laid off actually from Logitech
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.900]   on my 40th birthday, about 10 years later in 2011.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.380]   And I had, I don't know if you remember,
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.820]   but they knew CMO was brought in
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.900]   and they changed the whole structure.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.220]   And I had been a writer
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.820]   and they wanted to convert everybody to brand managers.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.500]   And I had recommended a colleague, a friend,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.420]   and then he ended up getting a writing job
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.020]   and being converted into the brand manager.
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.300]   And I was one of the people that got laid off.
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.740]   And fortunately there was someone
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.860]   that was working there at the time, Alex Lopez,
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.580]   and he ended up sending a bunch of work my way
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.180]   right after I got laid off and that got us through.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.340]   You know, at that point I had a young child
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.780]   and we didn't yet have a mortgage,
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.860]   but, you know, we had significant bills.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.140]   And so it was a little bit of leaning
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.340]   on my network to get us through.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.340]   And eventually I got a project job with an agency.
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.180]   And then at some point I got another job.
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.700]   And then at one point, a few months later,
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.820]   I had four or five job offers at the same time.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.740]   And I ended up picking the one that landed me at the Google.
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.900]   First time working for an agency
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.980]   embedded at the Googleplex.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.180]   And then what I learned was unemployment is really scary.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.660]   And when it first happens, you just,
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.140]   I just want to go to the bar.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.140]   I mean, at the time, that's what I wanted to do.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.020]   And, you know, I wanted to run away from it,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.420]   from the pain, from the feeling like I wasn't,
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.500]   I wasn't a value that it didn't matter
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.540]   all the things I had accomplished.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.420]   I really didn't make the cut.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.820]   And so I took it very personally,
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.260]   even though we know business is in most cases not personal.
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:09.100]   I do think there's a sort of, you know,
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.740]   exceptions to that is when you run your own business,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.380]   even though it's still business,
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.980]   it's, if you have a business, I think,
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.260]   and this is not necessarily the case for me now,
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.780]   but, and I, and you have employees,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.220]   it becomes a little more personal,
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.220]   especially the times I had a couple of boutique agencies,
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.620]   I was working all the time
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.900]   and it became such a big part of who I was
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.740]   and how I spent my time that, you know,
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.260]   it sort of bleed into that, you know, personal thing.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.620]   And I think there's something actually,
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.580]   and you see this on LinkedIn,
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.260]   where people sort of bleed their,
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.620]   the people call it personal brand,
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.220]   which I sort of despise this term,
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.500]   but it kind of bleeds your career into your, right?
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.340]   You hate that.
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.100]   That's what the thumbs up is for, right, Troy?
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.860]   And it's like, it's your personhood,
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.100]   but it's also your brand.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.340]   And they call it a personal brand
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.420]   and like how you present yourself on LinkedIn
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.260]   is who you are.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.220]   And I think it's a bunch of bullshit,
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.820]   but there is, I think it's this,
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.100]   especially when you're, you know,
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.780]   a lot of cases when you're owning your own business
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.300]   and maybe you've done so for a long time,
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.100]   or it's, you know, I haven't been in this situation,
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.580]   but it's a family business.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.740]   I think it becomes a little more personal,
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.620]   but let's just, you know,
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.420]   for most of the business I've been in,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.580]   corporate or agency, or even freelance,
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.060]   you know, you're right.
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.140]   A layoff is not personal in most cases
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.060]   and almost every, you know,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.980]   it's something structural has happened with the business
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.620]   or the business climate or the market
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.340]   or the economy or whatever.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.340]   And you just happen to be a number on a spreadsheet
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:47.860]   that, you know, goes in one column and that happens.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.620]   So in terms of,
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.500]   once I moved into a freelance capacity
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   and I was consulting with, you know,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.580]   more than one client at the same time,
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.620]   I think my experience, like you've described, Troy,
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.340]   is it happens in flows.
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.100]   And I've had some clients for a number of years
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.940]   and others that have come and gone,
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.940]   and I've never been completely out of work
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.980]   and I've often had a little too much.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.580]   And it's been more a balance between
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.500]   what can I successfully take on and still deliver.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.740]   But, you know, unemployment could happen.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.780]   And Tim, I think I agree with you too.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.860]   You become, especially if you have bills,
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.500]   you just, there's an urgent need
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.700]   to pick up whatever you can.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.180]   And so like my experience,
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.340]   I picked up a job selling coffee and candy bars to businesses
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.660]   and I had never done that before,
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.660]   but that's the job I took just to get through.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.060]   - Yeah, I think for anyone,
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.540]   first of all, thank you for sharing that, you guys.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.980]   Like, I totally agree with all of that.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.540]   And for anyone who's navigating unemployment right now,
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.040]   there's five things I would recommend you guys do.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.020]   First of all, make sure you're on sites like LinkedIn
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.620]   or Indeed or Glassdoor, right?
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.980]   These are job, they have job boards,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.020]   they're built for recruiters to find you.
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.340]   So make sure you're there.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.580]   Also know then that the way people find you
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.700]   is through keywords.
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.300]   So the whole discipline of search engine optimization,
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.140]   it applies here.
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.140]   Know what keywords recruiters are looking for
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.060]   and make sure you mention something like that
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.940]   in your LinkedIn profile, for example.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.820]   What you don't wanna do is regurgitate
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.820]   roles and responsibilities as posted in,
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.860]   just a thumbs up again,
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.320]   as shown up in a job description and copy and paste that.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.900]   That's not what we're looking for.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.260]   But you should rewrite your resume
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.360]   in a way that you show results and your impact
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.260]   and in your description of those impact,
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.900]   make sure those keywords are in there, right?
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.980]   'Cause that way your profile is discoverable by people.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.500]   The next one I would recommend is work your network.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.860]   And I don't mean like to be like annoying,
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.460]   but when you're looking for jobs,
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.060]   the best way to get in is through job referrals, right?
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.420]   So start looking at brands that you wanna work for
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.940]   or look for people that you know
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.700]   can have a strong referral for you,
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.520]   look where they're working
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.420]   and start looking at those job boards.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.820]   'Cause that's the best way to kind of get you in.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:32.000]   For your LinkedIn specifically,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.340]   do a post about specifically what you're looking for.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.620]   You know, you'll see a lot of people these days,
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.060]   they do open to work and hey guys,
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.700]   I'm looking for work, is someone gonna help me?
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.500]   Maybe here's a job or two.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.020]   Do more than that.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.860]   Say these are the examples of kind of jobs I'm looking for,
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.780]   or maybe these are my skill sets.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.740]   'Cause remember, a lot of the people
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.340]   who are responding to these,
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.340]   they're not necessarily people directly in your network.
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.140]   Anytime someone does a thumbs up on your post
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.780]   or does a comment on it,
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.000]   that shows up in their feed as well, right?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.820]   So now your exposure to the broader audience
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.620]   to second and third degree connections,
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.740]   that's how it happens.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.740]   So make sure you're very articulate
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.240]   about what you're looking for.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.160]   The next one is get in contact with headhunter agencies.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.520]   And in all of my unemployments,
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.960]   I like when you have a job,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.120]   their office often reaching out to you, right?
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.500]   Whether you're a manager
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.480]   and they're trying to offer their services to you,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.920]   or they're trying to see if you're available.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.460]   Now that you're available,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.780]   make sure they know you're aware.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.400]   And so what they need is a concise description
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.880]   of what you can do.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.480]   So a cover letter is often helpful and your resume,
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   but get yourself in their system.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.600]   And so you're an employable resource for them.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.580]   And the last one is gonna sound a little silly.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.780]   It's around controlling your budget.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.940]   I see a lot of, right now,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.940]   if you had the fortune of being laid off with severance,
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.900]   your first reaction could be like,
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.660]   hey, I'm gonna take the month off,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.500]   like I mentioned earlier, right?
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.700]   I'm gonna take this month off, it's gonna be for me.
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.140]   I'm gonna travel or whatnot.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.000]   This economy is tough.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.060]   So every dollar you sink into the luxury of a vacation,
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.820]   for example, just know that that could potentially
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.660]   shorten your duration of what you can be unemployed
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.500]   for finances.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.020]   So just budget accordingly.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.940]   I can't eat oatmeal to this day
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.400]   because the first time I was unemployed,
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'd made a decision to,
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.580]   I think my daily budget allowance for food was five to $10.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.320]   Another thumbs up.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.960]   Thank you, Zoom.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.360]   And what that meant was I wasn't,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.380]   all I could do was sugar and salt.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.340]   I couldn't put toppings, I couldn't afford fruit,
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.020]   but you guys, like spending like $15 a week on food,
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.700]   you stretch your fences really far.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.860]   That's also why I can't eat anymore.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.140]   Also, I'd save money aside for a wedding ring
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:06.020]   and I promised myself I wouldn't dip into that.
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.900]   And so I made extreme cuts in other areas of my life.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.340]   I did that.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.120]   So those are the top things I would recommend.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.780]   Now, right now, AI is already upon us.
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.480]   And so if you, you mentioned, Troy,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.800]   that like take this time every day
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.060]   to do something meaningful.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.120]   If you're gonna do something meaningful, learn about AI.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.280]   Could be the tools, understand the landscape,
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.680]   maybe find a way for it to help productivity.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.360]   OpenAI, they just announced like ChatGPT 4.0.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.060]   It looks fantastic, you guys.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.120]   As a matter of fact, I can see now
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.880]   certain job categories getting displaced as well
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.360]   due to their ability to visually identify, read,
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.700]   and just provide meaningful insights
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.400]   that a translator, for example, would be able to do.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.320]   And so that's, and Google at I/O this week,
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.680]   they also announced a lot of changes as well.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.180]   So just be familiar with that
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.660]   because as you're going into these interviews,
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.880]   being able to tell your story
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.520]   and having them understand who you are
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.480]   as an individual is important,
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   but also knowing that you're aware of the top trends
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.960]   just allows you to be more future-proof
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.960]   in terms of your marketability.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.560]   So make sure you save some time to do that
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.340]   while you're decompressing
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.000]   during this time of unemployment.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.760]   - I would add to that,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.000]   that if there are particular topics
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.920]   that are adjacent to the kind of work you wanna do
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.220]   that you're passionate about,
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.120]   write about those topics as well.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.440]   And not just, Jesse, by the way, is a master at this.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.960]   If you wanna look at his LinkedIn profile,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.520]   he's really good at taking a topic
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.880]   that relates to his work and my work as well
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.240]   and posting about it.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.040]   But yeah, write about those topics on LinkedIn
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.080]   'cause it's a great way to get noticed
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.780]   when you showcase your expertise and passion
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.680]   for a particular product or a particular topic.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.720]   - Yeah, there was a designer who I was kind of mentoring
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.040]   during this time of unemployment,
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   and his specialty was a very specific illustration style.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.960]   And what I told him was like, you know what,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.200]   while you're looking for jobs,
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.360]   start showcasing your work.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.800]   And not just showcasing the work,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.840]   but the in-progress work.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.700]   I think that's more fascinating, right?
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.800]   So if you look at just end product,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.520]   then it's very subjective on whether you like it or not.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:44.060]   But how you deconstruct or approach a design problem
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.400]   to arrive at your solution
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.160]   and kind of talk about the tools you're using
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.920]   or methodologies or inspiration,
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.640]   that gives someone who doesn't know anything about you
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   context of how you operate and work, right?
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.000]   And then more, and again, this takes effort and time.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.080]   And in this context,
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   I'm thinking specifically about LinkedIn,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.340]   but you're totally right, Troy,
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.120]   like putting yourself out there,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.920]   having people understand who you are,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.680]   knowing your point of view,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.440]   and then being proactive on other people's posts and feeds,
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.200]   all that does is increase your visibility
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.440]   to people who are not number one
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.480]   direct connections of yours.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.480]   And that just helps improve your reach.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.540]   - And I also add in terms of,
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.900]   thanks Troy for the nod to,
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.600]   at least one person's reading my posts.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.360]   And there it is, the fireworks.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.960]   Why do you, do I get those too?
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.380]   No, do it, it's not doing it.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.300]   Okay, I was gonna say the other thing,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.760]   the other interesting thing about,
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.500]   or Avenue and LinkedIn that is available is,
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.280]   there's all these people that are experts
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.560]   and many of them are very willing to talk to you
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.520]   about how they get there.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.440]   And so one of the things that I've done
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.900]   is not only be more active in terms of posting stuff,
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.440]   but, and some of that's been very gratifying.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.520]   And sometimes folks reach out with very,
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.640]   for me, it's very inspirational
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.100]   'cause they've been touched by things I've shared.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.060]   But people are often very generous
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.420]   about sharing their expertise.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.780]   And just, if you're able to connect with someone
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.060]   that has some more experience or talent or whatever,
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.420]   and you wanna learn,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.900]   I think some folks are very eager to share.
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.580]   And it's this social media platform,
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.900]   even though it's a professional network.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.520]   And I think there's a,
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.460]   it's probably underutilized feature of the site
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.840]   is that if you're connected with somebody,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.680]   just message them and say,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.980]   "Hey, I saw you posted about this.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:38.980]   "It was amazing.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.500]   "I'd love to ask you a few questions
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.160]   "or take you to a cup of virtual coffee or whatever."
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.280]   I think that's very helpful.
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.040]   - I wanna add something to that too.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.840]   I feel like I see an alarming number
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.160]   of new professional coaches
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.620]   that are out there that charge people.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.160]   I just wanna say that there's a lot of people
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.700]   that would be happy to help you
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.700]   and offer advice that don't charge.
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.100]   I think all three,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.460]   my assumption is all three of us
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.940]   would sort of fall into that camp.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.380]   Yeah, so there's a lot of advice out there
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.920]   that you don't wanna spend money for.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.940]   And frankly, I bet a lot of the free advice
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.820]   would be better than a lot of the paid advice.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.900]   - I totally agree.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.100]   I think the hardest part about this for a lot of people
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.860]   is embracing your own vulnerability
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.980]   and know that that could be the key
[00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.340]   to unlocking everything for you.
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.380]   The less guarded you become
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.500]   allows you to be more true
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.300]   in terms of articulating what it is
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.340]   that you really, really need.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.340]   And so when you put yourself out there saying,
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.220]   "Hey, look, I'm looking for advisement
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.840]   "on this very specific thing or this career path.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.820]   "I'm looking for a mentor who can help me
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.500]   "solve a very specific thing."
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.160]   The more you're able to articulate that,
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.540]   the more you'll be able to find the right feedback
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.980]   as opposed to getting someone who's very generic, right?
[00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.060]   And you might, again, to your point,
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.780]   you might find out that your whole network
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.300]   is very empathetic towards your situation
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.780]   and that might lead itself to connections
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.780]   to other people as well.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.880]   And so definitely don't underestimate the power of LinkedIn.
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.440]   - Hey guys, thanks again for watching and listening.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.340]   Next week, we'll be talking about dealing
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.660]   with the feeling of being in over your head.
