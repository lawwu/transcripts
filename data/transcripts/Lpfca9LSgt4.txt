[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   [Music]
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.640]   Well, should a Christian juror be quick to acquit in the courtroom?
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.280]   It's a question from a young man who wants to know, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.640]   Recently, my nephew, who attends a private Christian university,
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.080]   related to me an encounter he had with his New Testament professor.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.840]   This professor held that even if a Christian juror knew without doubt,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.880]   based on the evidence, that a defendant was guilty of a crime,
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.120]   the Christian's duty is to pass along a verdict of not guilty.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.720]   As proof, the professor cited Jesus' response to the woman who was caught in adultery
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.880]   and was brought before him in John 8, verses 1 to 11.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.480]   Since Jesus didn't convict the guilty woman, neither should we convict guilty criminals today."
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.440]   That's the basic summation of the professor's argument.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.120]   How would you respond?
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.280]   I would appreciate your thoughts on what God expects from Christian jurors.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.440]   And I'm curious, have you ever served on a jury yourself?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.320]   Well, let me just dispense with that first one.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.000]   No, I haven't, though I've been called up several times and they just never got to me.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.640]   So I went to the courthouse and sat there and I didn't even get interviewed.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.040]   But here's what he's really asking.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.320]   What's behind this question is not so much a misunderstanding of John 8,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.440]   rather it's an effort to carry through a consistent pacifism for Christians.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.280]   That's what's going on here and we need to probe that.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.480]   In other words, this professor is advocating for Christians never to return evil for evil,
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.000]   or eye for an eye, or any kind of punishment or retribution,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.240]   but only forgiveness, only release from all consequences for evil in this world.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.680]   That's what's behind the question.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760]   Is that approach to life taught in the New Testament?
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.520]   So let me first respond to his use of John 8, 1 to 11.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.480]   And I know that the earliest manuscripts of John don't have this story.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.640]   It may not be an original story, but for the sake of the argument,
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.880]   I'm just going to treat it as genuine.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   A woman is caught in adultery.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.840]   The Pharisees bring her to Jesus and remind him that this is a capital offense.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.360]   Leviticus 20, verse 10.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.000]   She should be stoned to death.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.160]   Jesus pauses, looks down, draws in the ground, says,
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.920]   "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone."
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.680]   What Jesus is doing here is setting in motion a massive change
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   in the way the new people of God, his followers, the church,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.120]   as distinct from ethnic, political, geographic Israel,
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   this new people of God will no longer be governed as a national,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   political, geographic, body politic with civil laws,
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.440]   regulating, for example, capital punishment the way Israel was.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   Rather, the church, the new people of God,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.720]   will not be a political or ethnic or geographic reality,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.640]   but it will be governed by the law of Christ,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.360]   which introduces significant changes from the law of Moses.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.320]   One of those changes, for example, we see being played out in 1 Corinthians 5,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.880]   where there is an example of adultery in the church, worse than adultery.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.160]   And the punishment that the apostle Paul requires is excommunication,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.000]   not execution, according to the Mosaic law.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.040]   That change is what Jesus is now setting in motion
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   when he refuses to participate in the stoning of this woman.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:07.320]   So we must ask, when he said that the one without sin should cast the first stone,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:15.960]   was he saying only sinless people can pursue retributive justice?
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.800]   Was he saying that only sinless people can actually be involved in the punishing of wrongdoers?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:33.560]   Is he saying no jurors who follow Christ could ever find anyone guilty?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.040]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.280]   Or is he saying, "I am about to forgive this woman
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   because I have authority on earth to forgive sins and fulfill and change the law of Moses.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.680]   I am about to transform her with the command to go and sin no more."
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.080]   So, if you are without sin and thus in a position like me, go ahead and contravene my judgment.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.440]   Now, I think the rest of the New Testament warns us against treating Jesus' words about
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:17.880]   casting the first stone as if they were a teaching that says only sinless people can exact justice.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.760]   The New Testament teaches that God has put civil government in place to punish wrongdoers.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:34.920]   Romans 13.4, "The ruler does not bear the sword in vain. He is the servant of God
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:41.560]   and an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer."
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.040]   Or 1 Peter 2.14, "Governors are sent by God to punish those who do evil
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.920]   and to praise those who do good."
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   Now, the Christian pacifist, this professor that we're being asked about, doesn't deny
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:06.760]   that the civil governments can find people guilty of crimes and punish them.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.880]   What the Christian pacifist denies is that God's people, the followers of Jesus,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.560]   should participate in that.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:21.080]   We are called to bear witness to the kingdom of Christ by not participating in the kingdom of
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.960]   this world on its terms, with its standards of retributive justice. That's consistent pacifism.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.440]   Our standard is, "Repay no one evil for evil."
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.760]   You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.960]   I say, "Do you resist no one who is evil? If someone slaps you on the right cheek,
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.800]   turn to them the other also."
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:51.000]   And so the Christian pacifist infers that this is the only way to show Christlike Christian
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   love in this world. This is the only way to bear a clear witness to Christ.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.480]   Now, frankly, I have a lot of sympathy with that view.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   I think all the texts that support it should probably have a greater effect on our attitudes
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:18.760]   than they do. But I can't go all the way with the Christian pacifist when he tells us that
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:28.280]   retributive justice should have no place in the Christian life, because I see in the New Testament
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:37.960]   at least five spheres of life where the Bible portrays proper Christian behavior as including
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.280]   retributive justice, that is, holding people accountable for wrong behavior and applying
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.520]   painful consequences for it.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.320]   For example, parenting.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.360]   Fathers are told in Ephesians 6 to bring up their children in the discipline of the Lord.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.240]   That word "discipline" we know from Hebrews 12 includes the application of chastisements
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   and consequences, painful consequences for our children.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   I think a father or a mother would be sinning if they only turn the other cheek for every act of
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.520]   disobedience and insolence from their children.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:24.680]   Of course, discipline is always mingled with mercy, but retributive justice is not excluded
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.560]   from parenting. Second, the marketplace.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:35.880]   Christian employers should pay their employees for the work they do and not keep paying them
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.360]   indefinitely for work they refuse to do.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:47.640]   If Paul could say to the church, "If they won't work, let them not eat," 2 Thessalonians 3.10,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:53.560]   how much more would he say to employees, "Let those who refuse to work not be paid,"
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.320]   withholding a salary from an employee who refuses to work is a form of retributive justice.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.120]   Third, education.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.480]   Teachers should not reward failing students with high grades.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:14.920]   They may show tremendous patience and mercy, but they do not equate sloth with superior performance.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.280]   There are consequences for failing to do your work.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:24.920]   Retributive justice belongs in education, always for the Christian, of course, mingled with
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.360]   patience and mercy.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.320]   Fourth, government, law enforcement.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.240]   We've already seen it in Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:40.120]   Lawbreaking should meet with appropriate consequences, fines, imprisonment, or even
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.320]   execution.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:48.680]   This is the way God restrains the rivers of evil in the human heart with common grace.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.720]   The common grace of retributive justice.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Finally, the church.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   The church is instructed to perform church discipline, which can include ostracism or
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   excommunication, which is a horrific consequence for unrepentant sin, if one takes the Bible
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.160]   seriously.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:19.320]   For those reasons, I can't follow the pacifist into the position where retributive justice
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.960]   has no place in the life of a Christian.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:30.920]   I admit very freely that the mingling of mercy toward our enemies and the application of
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.920]   justice is not easy.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.200]   We are supposed to love our enemies.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   We are supposed to return good for evil.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:47.720]   So the upshot for me is that I, we desperately need the Holy Spirit to guide us.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.600]   When should our witness to Christ involve turning the other cheek?
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.760]   And when should it involve spanking a child or not?
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.640]   Letting an employee go or not?
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.240]   Giving the student a C instead of an A or not?
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.600]   Excommunicating an adulterous Christian or finding some other way to move them forward
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.160]   for now.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:21.000]   And finding a murderer guilty while serving as a Christian juror.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.160]   That's really good and careful.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.120]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.400]   And thank you for joining us today.
