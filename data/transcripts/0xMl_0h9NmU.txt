[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   I should like to consider with you once more the second verse in Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.600]   Romans, the second verse in the first chapter, which in the authorized version is found in
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:23.040]   brackets, you remember, and in which we read, "Which he had promised afore by his prophets
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.520]   in holy scriptures." Now last week we considered that statement in general, looking at its
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.720]   component parts. We reminded ourselves that the apostle there teaches us that this good
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   news which he and the other apostles were proclaiming had been promised before by God
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.440]   himself. And here he reminds us of how God had given this promise. He had given it through
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.000]   his servants, the prophets, his prophets. And they had not only spoken this word but
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.320]   they had written it in holy writings, holy scripture. And that led us on to see that
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.920]   here the apostle teaches the typical biblical scriptural doctrine concerning the scripture
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   itself, that it is the word of God. This scripture is given by inspiration of God. All scripture
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:35.520]   is given by inspiration of God. Holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   Now we dealt with that last Friday evening and finished on the note that this is the
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:52.000]   teaching of scripture concerning itself everywhere, and that it is the teaching of our Lord himself,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   that you cannot read the four Gospels without discovering, as we saw in our example this
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.240]   evening after that fifth chapter of John's Gospel, how our Lord did thus regard the Old
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.360]   Testament scriptures as the word of God, and how he pointed out that not only in the prophets
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.680]   as such but Moses, which includes your five books of Moses, spoke of him. And that therefore
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.520]   obviously this is a matter which should engage our serious attention.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.240]   So I come back to it again this evening, as I suggested at the end last Friday evening.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.800]   I am going to try to do what I imagine the apostle himself did when he went round preaching.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.560]   You remember I indicated last Friday that it is very important for us always to remember
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.680]   that even these New Testament epistles do not each one of them claim to be a complete
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.080]   compendium of the whole of Christian doctrine. They are written to churches who had already
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.320]   had the preaching and the instruction. They are synopses. They remind them, in a very
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   condensed form, of the teaching which was given in a more elaborated form and at greater
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.880]   length by this apostle and by other apostles. You remember, for instance, that we are told
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.920]   that when Paul was at Ephesus for about eighteen months, he preached every single day. They
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.180]   met in the school of one Terranus, you remember. And there, as I think you will find the record
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.560]   tells you, if you take the trouble to look it up accurately, that from twelve o'clock
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.020]   to three o'clock every day the apostle spoke and preached and expounded the Scriptures
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.020]   to them.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.480]   Well now, we shall try to give some general outline this evening of the kind of thing
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.880]   that the apostle must have done on those occasions. Now, there are three main matters, it seems
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.920]   to me, that immediately challenge our attention on the basis of this statement concerning
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:20.440]   the Scriptures. The first does so in the most general way, and I can put it in the form
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:31.000]   of a question. The apostle tells us here that the God who had now sent his Son to do these
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.520]   things necessary for our salvation had promised aforetime that he was going to do so. And
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.920]   that raises the question, which we must ask with reverence, of course. Why did God act
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:05:02.040]   in this way? Why the delay? Why the long interval between the fall of men in the garden of Eden
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.600]   and the coming of the Son of God for redemption and for salvation? Why what the author of
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.680]   the epistle to the Hebrews says, the many parts and portions, the diverse manners, and
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.840]   so on? Why all this Old Testament history? Because we know full well that God could have
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:34.360]   done this at once and immediately. What is it that governs and controls this? There is
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.520]   a sense, of course, in which we can only attempt to answer such a question. Finally, we don't
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   know. We don't know fully. But it is always our business to go as far as we can, helped
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.640]   and aided by the teaching of the Scripture itself. And therefore I would suggest some
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:02.320]   such answers as these, because this problem has often perplexed many people. They can't
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.840]   understand why for so long, for so many centuries, this knowledge of God was confined to one
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:17.120]   race only, and all these other nations dwelt in darkness and in paganism. They say, what
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.280]   is the reason for that? Well, I suggest the following answers. First, that it is God's
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   way of revealing the depth of sin. God's way of showing mankind and teaching us what
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:40.120]   sin really is. What a terrible thing it is. That it is not merely some light act of disobedience
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:48.680]   or some failure. That it really is a profound disease of the soul of men, which leads to
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:55.880]   terrible and awful consequences. Now, there again, I think we've got an illustration
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.440]   of that in that portion of Scripture which we read at the beginning, out of the fifth
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:07.000]   chapter of John's Gospel. You see, the terrible thing about sin is that it blinds us to the
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.720]   truth of God. Our Lord's argument there on that occasion was this, you remember. These
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.120]   men claimed to be experts on the Old Testament. They were the teachers, the authorities, on
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.960]   the books of Moses and so on. And our Lord says to them, go back and read them. You take
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.840]   your pride in Moses, you say that it's your knowledge of him and his writings that gives
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   you salvation, well go and read him, because he wrote about me. But the tragedy was they
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.400]   couldn't see that. You remember the Apostle Paul takes up the same point in his second
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:48.760]   epistle to the Corinthians in the third chapter. He says the tragedy of the Jews is that though
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:55.640]   Moses is read to them every Sunday, they don't see the truth. Their eyes are blinded. There's
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:03.360]   a veil over their hearts. Now that's the sort of thing sin is. And with all this record
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.560]   of God's revelation of himself to them, they had the oracles of God, they were God's own
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:16.240]   chosen people, they were reading them Sunday by Sunday and oftener, and yet they couldn't
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:24.000]   see it because of the blindness which is the result always of sin. Well now, all this surely
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.640]   does help to bring that out. And you find this same thing, the same effect of sin in
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:38.440]   other forms. The terrible degradation into which the world had sunk as we shall be seeing
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.200]   when we come to the second half of this first chapter of this epistle to the Romans and
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:49.680]   so on. Part of the purpose, therefore, is to reveal that. But another reason surely
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:09:00.960]   is this. In this way God has finally proved to mankind that any attempt on man's own part
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:13.160]   to save himself is futile and inevitably doomed to failure. You see, God gave men a full opportunity
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.600]   of saving himself if he could. Look at the great civilizations that rose up. Some of
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.000]   them are mentioned in the Bible itself. Man has made these efforts and attempts to solve
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.720]   his problem. He believes he can do it. His pride of intellect makes him say that. His
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.840]   confidence in himself, in sin, makes him say it. Very well. God, as it were, stood back
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:43.360]   all these long running centuries and said, "Very well. Give me the proof. Do the thing
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.280]   which you claim that you can do." So you see these great civilizations, the Babylonian,
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:58.040]   the Egyptian, Nineveh, and Greece, and Rome, they come up one after another, but they all
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:08.760]   fail. Now you see, mankind is face to face with this evidence. Because mankind still
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:14.960]   doesn't accept it, it doesn't recognize it, but the facts are there. The facts are,
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.220]   you see, and they're proved by this long history of the Old Testament, that in spite
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:27.360]   of all man's concentration of effort and all his ability, he's as far away from God
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.800]   at the end, as he was at the beginning. Now the Apostle Paul puts that, you remember,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   in a memorable phrase in the first chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians, "The
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.480]   world by wisdom knew not God." And not only didn't it know God, it couldn't teach
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:52.820]   itself how to live. Now all the passing of these years establishes that indeed we can
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:02.360]   go further. God has even proved by what he did through these long centuries, that even
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:09.880]   to give his own law to mankind couldn't enable them to save themselves. Now the Apostle
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.760]   puts that, we shall find, in the eighth chapter of this epistle to the Romans, in the third
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:22.400]   verse, "For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.540]   his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin has condemned sin in the flesh,
[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.920]   that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:40.440]   but after the Spirit." But here's the nerve of the argument, the important point.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:48.080]   What the law could not do. It was never meant to do it, but people believed it could. People
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.720]   said, "Give us a law, tell us how to live, and we'll live it and we'll put ourselves
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.520]   right." They're still saying that. Well God gave them the law, and yet you see they
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:05.360]   couldn't keep it. The weakness of the flesh rendered them incapable of it. So the long
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.480]   passage of these centuries, in the case of the children of Israel, a special nation created
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   by God, blessed by God, given the records by God, and the full revelation, still they
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.920]   couldn't keep it and they wandered away from God. Their condemnation is established.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   The inability of men is absolutely proved. But finally I think another reason is this,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:44.980]   that God perhaps did this in order to show his own lordship over all, to show his absolute
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:54.040]   control, to show his final authority. In other words, you take the Old Testament history
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:02.240]   and you'll find that it really comes to this. It can all be divided into two sections, God's
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:12.000]   plans and God's permissions. There are accounts here of the tremendous activity of God when
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.440]   he came in, as it were, and erupted onto the human scene and did things. The flood, Sodom
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:25.240]   and Gomorrah, crossing the Red Sea, entering into Canaan, the waters of the Jordan being
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:31.840]   divided and so on, the mighty actions of God. Oh yes, but there were long periods when God
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.200]   seemed to be doing nothing, and permitted all sorts and kinds of things to happen, and
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.760]   people said, "Where is your God?" Then God acted, and finally acted in the sending
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.600]   of his Son. So you see, the very delay, as it were—we shouldn't use the term, but
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.640]   from our human standpoint there isn't a better one—but this tremendous length of
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.740]   time between the fall and the coming of the Son has demonstrated and established all these
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:14.320]   things. I'm not at all sure in my own mind that finally the ultimate reason is this,
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:23.920]   that the devil should be silenced, who is God's great antagonist, and who is always
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   ready to say that God is dealing with mankind unfairly. I believe that the ultimate purpose
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:38.880]   of this long gap, this great interval, was that the mouth of the devil might be silenced.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:47.600]   God has given mankind full opportunity to save itself, to put its world in order, to
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.480]   emancipate itself. He's blessed them in spite of their sin. He chose these people.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.160]   He gave them a law. Still, nothing works. And he allowed all these efforts and endeavors
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:08.960]   to be made, and they all came to nothing. The devil is silenced, and God is just, and
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.080]   there is not a word that can be said against him, his ordering of the life of the world
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.480]   or of his great salvation.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:24.120]   Very well, there is one of the themes that I felt was of necessity, one that had to be
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:31.080]   taken up in the light of this statement, but let us come to another. Why do you think the
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:42.640]   apostle insinuated this statement? You know, he always does this. I just glanced at this
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.560]   in passing last Friday evening. Let me show it to you still more. Even, you see, here
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:54.160]   in the introduction, when he really is wanting to rush on to his big statement, which is
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.520]   the gospel of God concerning his Son, whom he's going to describe. Ah, but even before
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.640]   he says that, he must say this, which he had promised aforetime by his servants, the prophets,
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:13.080]   and holy scriptures. Now, why did he do that? Why did he feel he must do it? And why did
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.240]   he always feel he must do it? Because he does the same thing in the third chapter in the
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.820]   twenty-first verse. "But now," he says, he's got his great argument here on justification
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:31.040]   by faith, "therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight,
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:37.660]   for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:46.040]   is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness of
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:52.920]   God which is by faith of Jesus Christ." You notice how he slips it in again? Witnessed
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:17:00.000]   unto, being witnessed by the law and the prophets. You see, he does it everywhere. But the most
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.480]   interesting example of all, of course, is in the last verse but one in the whole epistle,
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:14.600]   the sixteenth chapter of Romans, verse twenty-six. I think this is most interesting. The apostle
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:20.680]   begins this letter and ends it almost in exactly the same way. Let me read these verses to
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:27.640]   you. We'd better start with verse twenty-five. Here is his benediction. "Now to him that
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:34.600]   is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.800]   according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:49.480]   but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:56.960]   of the everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faith. To God only wise
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.260]   be glory through Jesus Christ forever." You see how he brings it in at the end? Starts
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:10.880]   with it, refers to it, ends with it. How anxious he seems to have been that these members of
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.320]   the church at Corinth should see the vital importance of this position of scripture in
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:23.040]   these matters. You may feel like saying to him, "Why doesn't he get on with it? Why
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.840]   doesn't he forget all about the Old Testament? Why will he keep on dragging in these prophets
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.480]   and these scriptures? What's all this got to do?" But the apostle, you see, keeps
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:41.600]   on doing it. Well now, he not only does it here, of course, he does it everywhere. You
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.620]   remember we reminded one another last Friday evening, I think at dinner we did so that
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.560]   this was his customary method. Take, for instance, what you read in the seventeenth chapter of
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:00.620]   Acts at the very beginning. "Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:09.600]   they came to Thessalonica where was a synagogue of the Jews. And Paul, as his manner was,"
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:18.460]   there you are, "went in unto them and three Sabbath days," what did he do? "reasoned
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:25.980]   with them out of the scriptures." He didn't tell them stories. He didn't talk about himself
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:32.220]   and illustrate them with affecting stories. He didn't just conduct singing. He reasoned
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:39.680]   with them out of the scriptures, opening and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:46.260]   and risen again from the dead, and that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ. You
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:54.260]   see his method? The scriptures, Old Testament, Moses and the prophets, the law and the prophets,
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:20:00.180]   he took them and he reasoned with them out of them, proving and alleging, demonstrating
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:06.540]   his point. That was his method. And then you remember when he writes his first epistle
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.860]   to the Corinthians. There was trouble in that church at Corinth since the apostle had been
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.420]   there. There had been other teachers and so on. He writes a letter and in the fifteenth
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:23.900]   chapter he begins like this. First epistle, chapter fifteen. "Moreover, brethren, I declare
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:30.180]   unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:37.300]   ye stand, by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:45.220]   ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:54.980]   now that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was buried
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:00.940]   and that he rose the third day according to the scriptures." Why will he keep on dragging
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.380]   that in? Why doesn't he forget about the scriptures? Why not get on with a positive
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:11.060]   preaching you may say? Why not tell us about Jesus Christ? Why keep on dragging in according
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:17.300]   to the scriptures? But you see, he did. He always did it. And we saw last Friday evening
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:23.180]   how in writing to Timothy, in the second epistle and the third chapter, in the fifteenth verse,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:30.220]   he says that the scriptures, the Old Testament scriptures, can make you wise unto salvation.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:37.980]   Well now then. The apostle, I say, keeps on doing the very thing that he does here at
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:45.660]   the very beginning of his letter. Why does he do it? Well, here are some of the reasons.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.060]   He did it because he was anxious to prove to them that this gospel, which he and others
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:22:00.140]   were preaching, was not in one sense something new and strange, which was a complete departure
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.780]   from the past. That is the charge that was being brought against him. There were people
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.420]   who were saying, and especially the Jews, "What's this new teaching? What's this
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:18.140]   new idea? What's this Jesus they're talking about? He wasn't a Pharisee. How could he
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:24.860]   therefore have been?" and so on. Now the apostle was anxious, I say, to show that this
[00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:31.420]   was not a departure from the past or a complete break with the Old Testament scriptures. His
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.980]   whole point was to show that it was indeed a continuation of what God had already been
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:45.860]   doing. That it was the same grand purpose of God which had started away back in the
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:52.180]   Garden of Eden and had been continuing right through the Old Testament times. It was just
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:23:01.100]   another act in the same series, not something entirely different, a continuation, a fulfillment.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.420]   And indeed, as we saw on our second Friday evening when we dealt with our analysis of
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:15.000]   this epistle, the apostle's great argument in chapter 4 is that God is still using the
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.380]   same method that he always had used, namely, faith. That God had never justified anybody
[00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:30.580]   on account of their works, always by faith. Abram was justified by faith. David was justified
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:36.300]   by faith and taught it in his 32nd psalm. And God is still doing that, says Paul, the
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:44.780]   same God, the same purpose, the same salvation, the same method of salvation. So how important
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.700]   it is that we should know our Old Testament scriptures. Now that's one reason, but there's
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:59.380]   a second reason. It was the apostle's way, of course, of establishing the two main points
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:07.700]   in his preaching. Now there in that seventeenth chapter of Acts, in verse 3, we are really
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:16.060]   given the two points which this great preacher always made every time he preached. And his
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:24.740]   two points were these. Proving and alleging that Christ must needs have suffered and risen
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:30.440]   again from the dead. That was point number one. Point number two, that this Jesus which
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:39.580]   I preach unto you is the Christ. Now you see his points. The Jews had got an idea of the
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:46.140]   Messiah that he was going to be a great military and political personage who would come along
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:52.780]   and set up a great kingdom and found a great army, attack the Roman conquerors and destroy
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:25:00.380]   them and become a great world ruler immediately. Their ideas were materialistic, mercenary.
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:09.260]   They thought purely in those terms, in a nationalistic manner. And to them, the idea that this carpenter
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:16.340]   who was crucified in weakness could conceivably be the Messiah was unutterable nonsense. It
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:21.220]   was the stumbling block. Very well, the first thing the apostle had to do, therefore, when
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:29.160]   he preached to Jews was this, was to prove to them out of their own scriptures that the
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:37.620]   Messiah must needs suffer. That the Old Testament scriptures had always taught that the Messiah
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.260]   was going to be a suffering Messiah, a suffering servant, one who was going to be rejected
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:48.300]   and put to death. He must needs suffer, be put to death, and rise again from the dead.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.740]   If he couldn't establish that, how could he possibly convince them? So he began with
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:59.820]   that. And he took them through these scriptures, showing how the scriptures had prophesied
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   that the Messiah was going to suffer in that way, suffer even death itself. Then, of course,
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:15.820]   having established that the scriptures taught that, the second step followed logically and
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:23.580]   inevitably. This Jesus whom we preach unto you is the Messiah. And then, you see, he
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.420]   did the thing which we were trying to do last Friday night. He showed all these detailed
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.940]   prophecies concerning him, and he said, "Well, now then, there's your evidence out of your
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:39.140]   own scriptures." But he couldn't have done that without the scriptures. That's why he
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:46.780]   keeps on bringing them in. Very well, therefore, we see that his case can be put like this,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:53.900]   as he puts it in the second epistle to the Corinthians in the first chapter, verse 20.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:27:03.820]   "All the promises of God are in him, yea, and in him, Amen, to the glory of God the
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:11.500]   Father." Every single promise, in part and portion, in detail, or in a grand manner,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:19.300]   it doesn't matter. "All the promises of God in him are yea, are Amen." Here's the
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:26.260]   fulfillment, once and forever, it's all in this one person. He is the fulfillment of
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:38.900]   the entire Old Testament. And finally, I think the apostle did this for this reason. He had
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.060]   to do it in order to deal with another aspect of the Jewish problem, which gave him great
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:51.420]   concern, and rightly so. Take this tremendous argument which you find in chapters 9, 10,
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:59.100]   and 11 of this epistle to the Romans. What is it? Well, we can put it like this. Paul,
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.580]   in chapter 8, has been telling these Roman Christians about the marvelous promises of
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:11.460]   God, that they needn't worry, that there are all these great promises of God behind
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.340]   them and around them. And the moment he said that, somebody got up always and said this,
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:24.540]   "Oh, that doesn't help us very much, because we read our Old Testament scriptures, and
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:30.980]   we see they're the marvelous promises that God gave to the Jews. But what of the Jews
[00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:38.420]   now? They don't seem to be much in evidence in your church. They seem to be outside, and
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:44.580]   the Gentiles are crowding in. What are the promises of God to the Jews?" Now that's
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:50.540]   a problem that's got to be faced. And if the gospel can't answer that, it collapses.
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:56.340]   But the gospel can answer that. And in chapters 9, 10, and 11, the apostle, simply by going
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.020]   through the Old Testament scriptures, shows that the doctrine of the Old Testament scriptures
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:09.180]   is ultimately the doctrine of the remnant. They are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:15.220]   There's a flesh, an Israel of the flesh, an Israel after the Spirit. He proves it from
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:20.620]   the scriptures, so that what is happening, he says, far from being a denial of the scriptures,
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.980]   is a fulfillment of the scriptures. But of course, if he didn't know his scriptures,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.620]   if he didn't bring this in, he couldn't have done that. And it is still an essential
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:36.820]   part of the preaching of the scriptures even today. And that is why it is so important
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:43.860]   that you and I should familiarize ourselves with these great arguments and should be able
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.700]   to use them and to imply them. The apostle in his preaching used to take the people right
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.740]   through all this so that they could work it out and give answers when they went back to
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:59.980]   their homes and were tackled by their relatives for having become Christians. They could prove
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.020]   that they were in a scriptural position.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:09.140]   Very well then, there we have dealt with two matters. Let me come to the final. The third
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.220]   great question that seems to me to come out of this statement here in the second verse
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:22.340]   is this, that surely here then there are some very vital lessons for us. There are certain
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:28.260]   things which we must take a firm grasp of and never lose hold of. What are they? Well,
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:39.940]   here is the first. The Bible is complete. By taking verses one and two together, I prove
[00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:47.420]   it in this way. The argument of this second verse is that the Old Testament is the word
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:56.940]   of God inspired, that it was written by men who were moved by the Holy Ghost, his prophets,
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:03.460]   God's prophets. Not mere words of men, but revelation given to men who are then inspired
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.580]   to record it. That is your Old Testament. But already you remember in dealing with the
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:15.620]   term apostle, we saw in the first verse that the same applies to the New Testament writings,
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:23.780]   for they are either written by apostles or else can be traced directly to apostolic authority.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:29.780]   Very well, then we say that in the Old Testament and the New Testament we have the complete
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:42.020]   revelation that God has given to men concerning these things. Which leads me to say this,
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:50.820]   that we must never add to this revelation. And that is our Protestant answer to the Roman
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:58.940]   Catholic Church. Their position is, of course, that since the end of this canon God has continued
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:06.340]   to speak through those who are the successors of the apostles, to which we have already
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:12.260]   replied that there is no such thing as a successor to the apostle. By definition, it is impossible,
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:18.940]   because an apostle is one who must have seen the risen Lord. He must be one who has been
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.580]   commissioned and to whom this has been given. There is no successor to the apostle. Very
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.260]   well, then. We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. There is no
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:35.980]   addition to the foundation. That is laid once and forever. You build upon it, you never
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:42.660]   add to it. There is no fresh revelation. So that we do not worship the Virgin Mary, we
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.180]   do not believe in the Immaculate Conception. There is not a word about it here. The Roman
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.380]   Catholics agree about that, of course. They say this has been revealed since. We say there
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:58.340]   is no subsequent revelation. This is complete. Old Testament, New Testament, given by God,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:03.700]   and it is all. There is nothing further. Everything, therefore, that claims to be revelation must
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:11.180]   be tested by this. So we reject the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. We reject the
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:19.220]   doctrine, likewise, of the Assumption and all these various other things for which they
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:26.060]   claim divine and unique authority. It is a violation of the Scripture's teaching about
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:34.140]   itself. The Bible is complete. There can be no addition to this. It is here given. The
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.780]   Lord himself promised to the apostles that he would reveal further truth to them through
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:44.620]   the Holy Spirit. He did so. That is what we have in our epistles and so on. Here, then,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.980]   is the complete revelation. But let me go on to a second point. The Bible, therefore,
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:59.820]   is authoritative. It is the only authority. It is our only rule and standard, and we must
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:07.500]   abide by its teaching in every respect. My message must always come from the Bible and
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:16.620]   from nowhere else. Further, my methods must also come from this. My whole activity in
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:24.340]   the things of God must be determined by the Bible, message and method. And as I have already
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:31.020]   said, I must not believe anything unless it is either plainly stated in the Scriptures
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:37.300]   or else can be legitimately deduced from the Scriptures. And if neither of those applies,
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:43.660]   I must reject it. It is not a part of the truth of God. I have no authority but this.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:49.140]   But this is my authority. And I must never go outside it. I must never try to add to
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:57.880]   it. I must never take from it. This, the whole Bible, is the revelation of God to man. It
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:07.020]   is the only authority. The next point, number three, is this one. The Bible is one. Though
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:14.140]   it consists of Old Testament and New Testament, it is only one book. I hate the idea that
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:22.700]   this is a library of books. Of course it isn't. It is one book. It is not even two books.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:30.040]   The Old Testament and the New Testament are one. It is the same fundamental truth about
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:39.700]   the saving God and his grand purpose. Old and New are parts of the same thing.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:48.780]   Point number four, the Old Testament is obviously, therefore, essential. We cannot dispense with
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.020]   the Old Testament because we are Christians and because we are living in what we call
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.460]   the New Testament dispensation. You know, there were certain heretics in the early church
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.260]   who thought they could. They said, of course, we don't need the Old Testament. That was
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:10.660]   the Jews' religion. That is a complete misunderstanding of it. That is absolutely false, according
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:17.700]   to this teaching. We, as Christians, need the Old Testament today. It is as much needed
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:24.700]   as ever, because of this unity and because of the things that are going to follow.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:32.580]   So are we all quite happy about that? Do you read your Old Testament every year, regularly
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:39.420]   as you do your New Testament? Do you go through your Old Testament at least once a year? You
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:47.340]   should. And how do you read your Old Testament? I find certain Christian people who only use
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:53.300]   their Old Testament, as they say, devotionally. They read the Psalms and perhaps the prayer
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.780]   of an occasional man, or a bit of history. They use it devotionally. You have no right
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:04.180]   to use it devotionally only. There is revelation there, and we need its revelation. We must
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:10.060]   read it in the same way as we read the New Testament. We must realise that it is a part
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:14.780]   of the revelation in exactly the same way.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:23.480]   But I come now, in my fifth point, to something which is still more important. Our interpretation
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:31.780]   of the New Testament must never contradict the teaching of the Old Testament. Now that
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:40.740]   is really serious. This tendency to put a wedge between the two has often led to that.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:45.380]   Let me repeat my principle. We must never interpret the New Testament in such a way
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:51.540]   or manner as to bring it into contradiction with the Old Testament. Let me take one example,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:58.300]   the most important of all. Take the doctrine of the atonement, the death of our Lord and
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:06.460]   Saviour Jesus Christ. Now you will find that it is very popular today to say, "Of course,
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:11.600]   you can't define the atonement. You can't define the death of our Lord." And, of course,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.340]   this idea of substitution and of punishment. We, as Christians, cannot accept that. As
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.500]   Christians, of course, we know that God is a God of love and that these ideas of justice
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.220]   and so on are quite remote. Of course, you get that sort of thing in the Old Testament,
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:33.180]   but we remember that the Old Testament is the Old Testament and it was the Jewish religion
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.660]   and they hadn't come to this full light. The full revelation of God and His love in
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:42.940]   Christ had not yet been given. So we say to them, "Well, what you say the cross is about,
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:49.360]   what is your idea?" Well, they say, "It's just this. It's God even forgiving the cruelty
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:56.820]   of men that put His own Son to death on the cross. That's what it is. Nothing else. God
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:03.100]   wasn't doing anything there. It's God forgiving Calvary, God forgiving the cruelty and the
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:09.380]   malignity of these blind people who didn't recognize His own Son. The Son forgave them
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:13.300]   and the Father forgave them. They say that's the teaching, the meaning of the death on
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:23.100]   the cross. But I'm here to assert that on the basis of what the Apostle says here about
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:31.100]   the Old Testament, that that's a lie. It's not true. It's an interpretation of the death
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:37.260]   which denies the teaching of the Old Testament. The Old Testament teaching is teaching about
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:43.900]   sacrifice. An offering has got to be made. Without shedding of blood there is no remission
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:51.020]   of sins. It was God who was putting His Son to death. It was God who made Him to be sin
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:57.940]   for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. It was God
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:06.420]   who, by striping, punishing Him, was dealing with our sins that He might forgive us, that
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:12.460]   He might be just, as we shall see in chapter 3, and the justifier of Him that believeth
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:21.660]   in Jesus. The whole teaching of the Old Testament is expiation, punishment of sin, that a holy
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:29.340]   God must, that blood must be shed, that a sacrifice and an offering must be presented.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:37.260]   And if I interpret the death in the New Testament apart from those terms of sacrifice and expiation,
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:45.060]   my interpretation is wrong. You see the importance of holding on to your Old Testament? I delivered
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:52.100]   unto you first of all, says the Apostle, how that Christ died for our sins according to
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:57.980]   the Scriptures. Not this sentimental view of His death, but according to the Scriptures.
[00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:05.380]   The Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world. The great antitype to
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:13.300]   which all the types have been pointing. Here it is. Hold on to your Old Testament, my friend.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:19.820]   And beware lest you interpret the New at any point, or in any respect, in a manner that
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:25.660]   doesn't show that the New is the fulfilment of the Old. Very well, I'll put that as
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:32.100]   my next point, number 6. The New Testament does fulfil the Old Testament. Here is a very
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:38.680]   important practical point again. If you don't remember that, your view of salvation may
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:44.420]   very well be a false one. You know there are some false views of salvation. There are people
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:51.540]   today who seem to teach and to believe that you can take Christ as your Saviour without
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:57.020]   taking Him as your Lord. They say you can take justification without taking sanctification.
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:04.920]   They say you can get forgiveness of sins without holiness. It's a lie. The Apostle puts it
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.620]   like this at the end of the third chapter of this epistle to the Romans. Do we then
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:19.340]   make void the law through faith? God forbid. Yea, we establish the law. And if your view
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.680]   of salvation is one that seems to you to say that the law you needn't worry about any
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:28.560]   longer, that you can live as you like as long as you believe in Christ, that it's just
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:36.240]   forgiveness, you have never understood it. Salvation is something that fulfils the law.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:42.960]   It doesn't avoid the law, it fulfills it. And I have already quoted Romans 8 to you.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.220]   What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His Son in
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.820]   the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemns Him in the flesh that the righteousness
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:43:00.840]   of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.120]   Listen to Paul saying it in another place, "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:12.140]   the Lord." You can't receive Him except as the Lord. You can't take Him as your Savior
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.800]   and say I'll later perhaps take Him as my Lord. He's always the Lord and you receive
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:24.200]   Him as Lord. The new is the fulfillment of the old. And the same thing I feel often applies
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.040]   to the whole question of rebirth. There are people who seem to think that the Old Testament
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:35.400]   saints were not born again, but it's thoroughly unscriptural to say that they were. We as
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.080]   Christians are Abraham's seed. We are children of Abraham and children of faith and the kingdom
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:47.600]   into which we have entered is the old kingdom in which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob have been
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.160]   for so long. You see the importance of realizing that the New Testament is the fulfillment
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:00.360]   of the old. The other thing it reminds us of is this. This is my seventh point. If you
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.640]   keep your eye on the Old Testament always you will remember that there is a world purpose
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:13.740]   in salvation. Salvation is personal, thank God, but it's much more. God has got a purpose
[00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:20.400]   for the whole world and you'll see it in chapter 11 of this epistle to the Romans.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:28.200]   The fullness of the Gentiles, all Israel, the complete plan. Never lose sight of that.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.520]   The Old Testament emphasizes that because it gives you a picture in its first 11 chapters
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:41.680]   of Genesis of the world at large before God had separated this one nation. The worldview,
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:47.040]   the Old Testament always emphasizes it. There are other things which I'll merely give you
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:54.220]   the headings of this evening because our time has gone, I regret to say. But the importance
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:45:01.760]   of keeping your eye on the Old Testament emerges here, in the whole question of evangelism
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:11.280]   and revivals and the relationship between the two. If you keep your eye on the Old Testament
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:18.800]   you can never have a subjective evangelism, by which I mean this, that the business of
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:24.640]   evangelism is not just to solve people's problems. Psychology does that, the cults
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.760]   do that, many things do that. The thing that separates this from every other teaching is
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:39.400]   this, that it is primarily a proclamation of God and your relationship to God. Not your
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:44.640]   particular problems, but the problem that is common to all of us, that we are condemned
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:52.240]   sinners before a holy God and a holy law. That's evangelism. It must therefore always
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:58.080]   put repentance first. Now the Old Testament constantly reminds us of that. You can't
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:08.800]   get away from it. But also it does this. It shows us, I say very clearly, that God's
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:17.760]   way of keeping his cause and his truth alive is the way of revivals. You work through your
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.600]   Old Testament and this is what you'll find. There were those dead, lifeless periods and
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.640]   you'd think that everything had come to an end. How did they suddenly give way to
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.440]   something else? Was it that people got together and organized something? Never. Never. Not
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   a single occasion. Invariably it happens like this, that when they were all utterly hopeless
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:47.640]   and downcast and really thought the end had come, God suddenly, unexpectedly, and in a
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:54.720]   most amazing manner, did something. It's God who revives his work. You see, you and
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:59.200]   I tend to be anxious, over-anxious, about the ark, don't we? And like that poor man
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.840]   Elsa, we put our hand to steady it and he was struck dead for attempting to do so. And
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.160]   there are many people today who seem to think that they've got to do something to safeguard
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:15.400]   God's cause. My dear friend, you needn't trouble. God revives his work. But in his
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:22.840]   time, in his way, and with the person whom he's chosen. The Old Testament history is
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.520]   most amazing in that respect. So that finally I come to this. There is nothing more comforting
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.880]   and more encouraging to the Christian than to be familiar with the Old Testament scriptures.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:42.360]   Paul, you see, puts it like this in this very epistle, in chapter 15, verse 4. "For whatsoever
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:48.840]   things were written before time were written for our learning, that we through patience
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:56.280]   and comfort of the scriptures might have hope." Is there anybody depressed and discouraged
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.560]   in this congregation? Go back to your Old Testament scriptures. Read them, study them.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:08.320]   Learn them by heart. See God's method. There is nothing that so encourages us and teaches
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:15.160]   us to exercise patience as the Old Testament does. The whole of the length of Hebrews is
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:25.000]   used in that way, you remember. So that my very last point is this. You and I must learn
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:38.920]   to submit ourselves utterly and absolutely to God's ways and never question. I'm a preacher,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.880]   says Paul, of wonderful good news. Ah yes, but God had said before time that it was going
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:52.200]   to happen and going to come. But all the centuries passed and nothing seemed to happen. What's
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:02.000]   the lesson? The lesson is this. Put yourself and everything that is of concern to you entirely
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.680]   in the hands of God. His ways are strange. You remember he tells us through Isaiah that
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:15.160]   he says, "My ways are not your ways, nor your thoughts my thoughts. His ways and thoughts
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:23.600]   are higher than ours, as the heavens are higher than the earth." Put your case into his hands.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:29.240]   Is it a personal problem in your life? Leave it there. Are you worrying about the conversion
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:34.160]   of some dear one? You've been praying for years and nothing seems to happen. And you're
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:39.240]   on the point of giving up and you say, "What's the use?" If you feel like that, go back to
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:46.320]   the Old Testament and realize that after God gave the promise about the seed of the woman
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:55.640]   in the Garden of Eden, that four thousand long years passed before the seed of the woman
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:02.560]   actually came and was born by a babe in Bethlehem. That's God's method. Don't give up. These
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:07.360]   are God's ways. I don't understand them, but that's the teaching of the Old Testament.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:13.320]   That's what I deduce from this little verse in brackets. Or are you troubled about the
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:19.580]   state of the church, the dwindling congregations, the opposition of the world, the might of
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:24.880]   the world, the organization of the world, and all these things? Oh, I say go back and
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:30.480]   get hold of the comfort and the consolations of the Scriptures. Or are you troubled by
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:36.560]   something that's happening in the world today? Well, put it in the context of the Old Testament.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:43.080]   I was never worried for a second about a man like Hitler. It was enough for me to read
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:48.040]   the thirty-seventh Psalm. And there I read of a man like him spreading himself like a
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:55.120]   green bay tree and a sort of colossus striding the whole earth. But I read that a day come
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.480]   when a man went to go and see him and speak to him and couldn't find him. He searched
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:06.800]   everywhere for him but couldn't find a trace of him. He'd vanished. Why, God had blown
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.720]   upon him. And the Old Testament is full of that sort of thing. Very well, then, in the
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.960]   light of all this, what can we say? I've nothing to say but this. Oh, the depth of
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:24.840]   the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God. How unsearchable are his judgments
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:31.320]   and his ways. Past finding out, he seems to go to sleep for centuries, but he's still
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.840]   there. His ways are past finding out. For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   may instruct him? Or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed to him
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:56.880]   again? For of him and through him and to him are all things to whom and to whom alone be
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:10.000]   glory forever. Amen. Which he had promised aforetime by his servants, the prophets, in
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   the holy scriptures. Let us pray.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:21.560]   Oh Lord, our God, we pray thee to make these things living and real and true to us. Forgive
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:27.440]   us, we pray thee again, for our neglect of thy Word and for our failure to realize their
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:35.960]   message. Forgive us, oh God, that we are ever depressed or downcast or fearful or apprehensive
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:44.400]   or crushed by some care. Oh Lord, teach us to use the scriptures which thou hast given
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:52.940]   to us for our comfort and consolation, for our edification and establishment in the faith.
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:53:01.320]   Oh Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing. Enlighten the eyes of our understanding and manifest
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:10.280]   thyself unto us more and more. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:16.200]   and the love of God and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:22.680]   continue with us now throughout the remainder of this our short and certain life and earthly
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:28.200]   pilgrimage and evermore. Amen.
