[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.740]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.980]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.920]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.480]   I'm delighted to kick off this premium subscriber AMA.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.040]   And today I have some great announcements to make,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.280]   including the fact that we have now expanded our SciComm,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.720]   that is the parent company of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.560]   As some of you know,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820]   we've expanded our SciComm Huberman Lab Podcast philanthropy
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.500]   to support great, exciting science
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.840]   that is going to directly relate to mental health,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.740]   physical health, and performance tools
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.000]   in the very near future.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.400]   And we've been able to do that thanks to all of you,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.280]   because we use a significant portion of the funds
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   from the premium channel subscribers
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.160]   to support exciting work on humans.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.920]   So these are laboratories working on questions
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.800]   such as improving mental health, physical health,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360]   and performance from a variety of approaches
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   at all major universities.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.300]   And we've supported work at Stanford,
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.240]   Columbia University, University of Oregon coming up.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.660]   We're actually supporting some programs
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.540]   related to student training and teaching
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.060]   in the realm of neuroscience and happiness.
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.740]   So some really exciting groundbreaking areas
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.840]   all made possible thanks to you
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.460]   and the fact that we now have three dollar for dollar matches
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.340]   from exceptional donors.
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.780]   When we started this premium subscription model
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.260]   to support science,
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.620]   we had one still have this one absolutely spectacular
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.920]   dollar for dollar donor match from the tiny foundation.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.720]   And now two others have joined in.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   So for every dollar that is used from the premium channel
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.600]   to support these exciting areas of research,
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.760]   we now have $3 being donated to match that dollar.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.560]   So we essentially have a four X what we would otherwise give
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220]   in terms of supporting exciting new research on humans
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280]   in various laboratories at Stanford and elsewhere.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.720]   I'll just touch on a few areas
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.560]   that we are supporting going forward.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.440]   This is not an exhaustive list,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.520]   but for instance, we are supporting some exciting work
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.680]   using deliberate heat exposure
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.520]   to treat symptoms of depression,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   a really interesting and forward-looking approach
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   to treating depression for which there's already
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.080]   some really exciting preliminary results.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.280]   We are going to be supporting work on goal-setting
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.880]   at New York University.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.540]   This is really exciting work.
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.000]   Many, many people struggle with goal-setting
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.480]   and habit formation that can serve them in their career
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.760]   and in their personal life and fitness goals, health goals.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.940]   This work directly relates to that.
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.120]   In other words, you're supporting that work.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.960]   We are also supporting work on immune system,
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240]   nervous system interactions.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.400]   This is an area of science
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.960]   that's now really progressing quickly
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.480]   that explores how, especially in babies and kids
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.520]   and young adults, but also in more mature adults,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   interactions between the brain and nervous system
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.400]   and the immune system can cause all sorts
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.960]   of interesting susceptibilities,
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   but also patterns of resilience
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.960]   in people that do specific things
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.280]   as it relates to supporting their immune system.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   So thanks to you and these dollar-for-dollar
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.760]   matching donors, we are able together,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.960]   but mainly thanks to you,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.240]   to support these exciting areas of human research.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240]   And as the data come in,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.040]   we are going to relay what the new findings are
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.000]   and of course, translate those where appropriate
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.400]   to protocols for improving mental health,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.560]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.240]   So I want to extend a deep, deep, deep message
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.160]   of gratitude to you for supporting science,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.400]   for supporting new research,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.520]   and for supporting the evolution
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.920]   of new data to serve humanity.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.560]   Thank you ever so much.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.800]   Okay, so without further ado,
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.560]   let's get to answering your questions
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.400]   about mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.560]   The first question comes from Robert.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.320]   And the question is,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.840]   is there any way to repair thinning skin as we age?
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.280]   I'm 77 years old, and in the last few years,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.200]   the skin on my arms has gotten noticeably thinner.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.040]   Thank you.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.160]   Well, thank you for this question.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.280]   It's a very timely question,
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280]   given that we just had a solo episode.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.120]   I did a solo episode
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.140]   about skin health and appearance on the podcast.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.480]   I should mention that that episode was reviewed
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.180]   by a dermoncologist.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.800]   I consulted with different dermatologists
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720]   prior to that episode.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.460]   And my general sense is that it's been received very well.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.300]   There are a few areas
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.520]   within the skin health and appearance field
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.020]   that are of controversy, mainly around sunscreens.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.720]   I'll just go on record saying that it's very clear
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.720]   that excessive sun exposure will age skin more rapidly.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   Okay, that's just categorically true, okay?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.240]   So if anyone's debating that, you know,
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.440]   there's an issue there, right?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   There shouldn't be any debate about that.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.120]   It's absolutely true that sunscreen can help.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360]   And there are sort of three major forms of sunscreen.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.000]   This relates to how to protect skin from thinning.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   One is a physical barrier.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.660]   Pretty much nobody disputes a physical barrier,
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.840]   a hat, a long sleeve shirt, long pants, et cetera.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.080]   However, those don't always cover all the areas
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   of the body that needs sun protection,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.000]   such as the ears, the back of the neck,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.180]   portions of the face, and so forth.
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.420]   When it comes to sunscreens, sometimes called sunblocks,
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.080]   I think there's general agreement that the sunscreens,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.580]   and I'll use sunscreen and sunblock interchangeably,
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.840]   that are mineral-based, that is inorganic,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.920]   meaning that the active ingredients are either zinc oxide
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.440]   or titanium dioxide, or some combination of those,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.160]   up to a concentration of 25%,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.880]   are generally deemed safe by most all dermatologists.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.960]   Now, there are some people who will point out
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.040]   that there's some controversy
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.800]   around certain forms of titanium dioxide.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.560]   The evidence for that, however, is not conclusive.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.760]   I would say that if you're really, really concerned
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.000]   about any of that,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   then just stick with a pure zinc oxide formula up to 25%.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.840]   Why would people not use zinc oxide formulas?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.280]   Well, they tend to be kind of pasty,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.120]   and they don't spread on very easily
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.220]   compared to some other sunscreen formulas.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.240]   Sunscreens that are "chemical-based,"
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.280]   okay, everyone will say, "Well, everything is a chemical."
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.180]   Yes, but they're chemical-based.
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.120]   They use a different approach to blocking or reflecting
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.680]   or absorbing UV rays.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.440]   Those do indeed have some controversy around them.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.200]   There are a few studies in which very large amounts
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.760]   of those chemical-containing sunscreens,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.180]   these are chemicals like oxobenzene, et cetera,
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.280]   applied to the skin,
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.300]   and they do make it into general circulation.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.320]   They do blood draws.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.080]   They see that some of these chemicals
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.600]   can be endocrine disruptors,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.240]   leading some people to believe that chemical-based
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.300]   or sunscreens that contain some of these chemicals
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.140]   are to be avoided.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.880]   Now, I want to be very clear on my stance,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.000]   which is if you need sun protection,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.760]   and the choice is either to use those types
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.400]   of sunscreens occasionally versus no sun protection,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.000]   I would say probably better to just use them,
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.280]   but if you are picking a sunscreen, aka sunblock,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.080]   where you are going to be using it all summer
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.740]   or very frequently, well, in that case,
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.800]   probably best to go with a mineral-based sunscreen
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.000]   because you'll be doing more frequent exposure application.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.840]   Okay?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.160]   And then, of course, there are people that will argue
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.320]   that the chemical-based sunscreens are, in fact, fine,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.280]   and if that's your threshold,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.740]   meaning that there isn't enough conclusive evidence
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.380]   that they're problematic, then that's fine.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.000]   So those are the three general categories,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.460]   but yes, sun will damage the skin.
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.000]   That doesn't mean you shouldn't get any sun exposure
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.840]   to your skin.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.760]   Turns out that generating vitamin D, of course,
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.720]   getting your circadian rhythms right,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.320]   hormone production, et cetera,
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.860]   actually requires some exposure to sunlight.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.720]   You just don't want to do it
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.540]   during the highest UV index portions of the day,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.280]   like the middle of the day.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   You don't want to burn.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.960]   However, and please note this,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.520]   you do not have to burn in order to put yourself
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.040]   at a greater risk for skin cancer.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.820]   So, you know, avoid burns,
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.240]   but avoid excessive sun exposure for you as well.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.340]   Now, back to Robert's question.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.180]   The skin is thinning.
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.120]   Why is it thinning?
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.720]   Well, as we get older,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.000]   the composition of the proteins in skin,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.640]   and there are many different proteins,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.280]   but in particular, the collagen and elastins
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.240]   start to either mutate or weaken.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.080]   There can be less production of these.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.560]   The skin sometimes loses moisture as well.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.320]   And the basic solution to this is the following.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.600]   We know that sun protection will help.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.960]   We also know, and I covered this in the episode,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.000]   that there's some evidence, okay?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.600]   I would say it's moderate evidence.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.840]   It's not extremely strong.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.900]   It's not weak.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.920]   That ingestion of collagen proteins, believe it or not,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   can improve skin elasticity
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.340]   and the appearance of smoothness and plumpness,
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.320]   as it's subjectively rated in these studies.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.600]   You might ask yourself, well, how is that?
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.380]   Is it that you ingest collagen?
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.760]   And by the way, people typically do this
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.960]   at dosages of anywhere from,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.520]   you'll see as low as five grams per day,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.920]   but as high as 30 grams per day of collagen protein.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.860]   Typically, there's some vitamin C in there as well,
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.960]   which seems to help its absorption or utilization.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.440]   And they will observe, in these studies,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.120]   over time, some improved elasticity,
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.460]   appearance of smoothness, and plumpness of the skin.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.400]   So should you ingest collagen protein?
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.040]   Well, the results are, again, statistically significant,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.520]   but they're not overwhelming in the sense
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.920]   that you're not going to reverse all the thinning
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.760]   and what appears to be a local sagging
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.840]   of the skin completely by ingesting collagen,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.920]   but it can help.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.600]   Collagen can be ingested through things like bone broth.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.960]   By the way, collagen is a composition of not just skin,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.840]   but of tendon and ligaments and things of that sort.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.680]   Typically, people will get their collagen in powdered form.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.640]   It's relatively inexpensive.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   There are a lot of different forms of this,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   from fish, from animal sources.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.320]   There are some plant-based sources.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   It's a little unclear whether or not those are as good,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.980]   but in any event, five to 30 grams,
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.120]   typically 15 to 30 grams in most of the studies,
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.360]   does seem to be moderately effective
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.480]   in improving skin elasticity, plumpness,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.760]   and appearance of smoothness.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.480]   Okay, so that's one area.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.300]   The other area where there's some interesting research
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.120]   is red light exposure.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.660]   So red light exposure is an interesting one
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.920]   because, of course, in sunlight,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.420]   we have full spectrum light, right?
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.480]   If you ever put a prism out
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.660]   and you get a light beam through it,
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.720]   you're going to get the rainbow, right?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.560]   It includes red.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.680]   There are long wavelengths,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.520]   aka red wavelengths of light.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.540]   I pause as I say red wavelengths
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.240]   because they're actually long wavelengths of light
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.780]   that appear red.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.720]   And it has been shown that light panels
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.760]   that are emitting red light or near infrared light,
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.560]   or typically both, can also improve skin appearance
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.020]   if done for about 10 to 15 minutes per day,
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.440]   maybe five days per week minimum,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.800]   over the course of a few months.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.800]   Again, the results in those studies
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.480]   are statistically significant in many of those studies.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.000]   And I would place them in kind of the moderate result,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.760]   meaning it's not a striking result,
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.320]   but you could imagine combining red light with the collagen.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.760]   So you start to get perhaps a synergistic effect,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.700]   but those studies combining them have not been done.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.820]   It does seem that one of the best,
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.760]   that is dermatologists supported ways
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   to improve skin appearance is to ingest a retinoid.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.860]   Now, these are prescription drugs.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.980]   The retinoids do require that, you know,
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.960]   you work with a qualified dermatologist.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.740]   They require that you stay out of the sun
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.640]   for some period of time
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.200]   because they can increase sensitivity to the sun,
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.520]   but they will improve collagen composition.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.720]   And that's from the inside out.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.980]   So, and by the way,
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.800]   there are also some different supplements
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.120]   that one can take that can protect your skin
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.600]   so that you don't have to put sunscreen on.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.200]   It's actually the extract of a vine.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   I did not cover that on the skin health
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.760]   and appearance episode,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.560]   but we very soon have a guest, Dr. Tio Silomani,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.000]   who is an expert dermatologist oncologist
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.480]   trained at Stanford and Harvard and UCLA,
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.400]   who is going to talk about the use of essentially
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.240]   sun guarding by the ingestion of certain compounds
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.600]   that change the chemical composition of the skin
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.440]   from the inside.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.720]   So that's very interesting.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.280]   He also added another tool for improving skin appearance.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   And this is true for the face and for the arms, et cetera,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.840]   is the use of laser resurfacing.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   Now, this is not a cosmetic procedure
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   as much as it is a procedure
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.880]   to remove the very top epidermal layer,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.120]   the very, very superficial layer of dead keratinocytes
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.800]   and other cells of the skin, excuse me,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.600]   as a means to reduce cancer risk.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.520]   Okay, so he's a dermal oncologist.
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.240]   It does have the consequence of making skin
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.560]   look quite a bit younger.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.960]   So it does work.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.280]   And like anything in the realm of kind of laser resurfacing
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.400]   and things of that sort,
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.020]   it does require a period of peeling,
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.560]   of staying out of sunlight,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.040]   because, and being really strict about that
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.280]   because the skin is more sensitive in the immediate days
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.560]   and even week after the laser resurfacing.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.440]   It was kind of remarkable for me to learn
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.920]   that this laser resurfacing and the retinoids
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.400]   are very well supported by dermatologists
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.640]   as a preventative measure for certain forms,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.040]   not all forms, but certain forms of skin cancers,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.080]   and that they can dramatically improve
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.840]   the appearance of skin,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.040]   that is to make it look more youthful.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.160]   So certainly that would work on the arms as well.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.640]   So we've got, we're talking about collagen, red light,
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.440]   retinoids, laser resurfacing by a qualified dermatologist
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   or dermoncologist ideally.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.820]   And the reason I emphasize the derm part
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.760]   is there are a lot of people who do kind of plastic
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.280]   and cosmetic work on skin who are probably very qualified.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   And then there's probably some who are not as qualified
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.360]   and there can be some real issues raised
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.720]   by using excessive laser power and things of that sort.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.000]   This is something I also touched on in the episode.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.560]   So those are the four major ones.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.720]   And then of course, eating a diet that's low inflammatory.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.480]   So limiting fried and highly processed foods, of course,
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.860]   making sure that you're getting enough essential fatty acids
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.360]   in the form of either supplementing
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.240]   or ingesting fatty fish, oils,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.960]   all of these sorts of things, fruits and vegetables,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.100]   fiber, all the sorts of things
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.440]   that support healthy skin internally,
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.040]   some directly, some indirectly
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.000]   by virtue of the gut microbiome.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.480]   So I think that's probably a sufficient answer.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.220]   Ah, I will add one last thing for your question, Robert.
[00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.360]   It's very clear that the appearance of skin
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.880]   is also very supported by hydration and moisture.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.400]   So applying a regular moisturizer,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.160]   a high quality moisturizer regularly,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.460]   pick a non-fragranced moisturizer regularly to the arms,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.520]   that will help as well.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.580]   And then there's some more aggressive approaches
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.960]   that I'll talk about with Dr. Soleimani,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.360]   things like hyaluronic acid and things of that sort
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.800]   that can help with the kind of plumpness
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.680]   or moisture of the skin,
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.420]   but we'll hold off for that episode,
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.920]   which comes out in a few weeks.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.160]   So thanks again for your question.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   I like to think that those are some actionable tools
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.120]   and then depending on people's disposable income,
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.960]   time and energy they wanted to devote to this,
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.040]   you could go with the zero cost one, the moderate cost one,
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.440]   or on the combination of all of them, if you're able to.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.120]   Okay, the next question comes from Jen Shaw.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.360]   How cold does the water need to be
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.740]   for cold therapy to be effective?
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.760]   This is a great question,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.960]   especially since at least in the Northern hemisphere,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.840]   it's summer and people are doing cold plunges more,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.680]   cold showers, such an effective tool
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.800]   for shifting the state of your mind.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.680]   Any debate about deliberate cold exposure to me
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.040]   that centers around metabolism
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.200]   or how long the dopamine increase lasts
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.240]   is kind of a trivial one in my estimation,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.960]   because what do we know for sure?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.280]   We know that deliberate cold exposure
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.000]   is very, very low cost or even cost saving
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.080]   if you use a cold shower,
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.200]   'cause you're saving on the heating bill.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.020]   We know that if you can afford a cold plunge
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.020]   or access a safe river or stream or cold plunge, great.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.360]   What do we know it does?
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.320]   It's changes your state, it shifts your state.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.600]   It makes you more alert, not just while you're in there,
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.620]   but in the minutes and certainly up to an hour
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.360]   or more afterwards.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.960]   And let's face it, rarely does it feel good getting in.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.640]   Sometimes it feels good being in it
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.440]   because you're very, very warm before you get in it.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.120]   Maybe you came from a run or from the sauna,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.680]   but it always feels great getting out
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   and you always feel much better afterwards
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.480]   provided you get the right stimulus,
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.000]   which is really what this question's about.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.440]   So what is the right stimulus?
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.700]   How cold?
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.700]   Cold enough that you feel a bit uncomfortable
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.160]   and you want to get out,
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.880]   but you can safely stay in
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.480]   and you stay in for a little bit longer.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.440]   Now, I know that sounds vague,
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   but there has never been a systematic study
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.880]   of exactly how long to stay in at a given temperature
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   at a given time of day.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.760]   Why do I say at a given time of day?
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.480]   Well, try doing a cold shower first thing in the morning.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.360]   It can be pretty rough, pretty jarring.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.320]   Try doing it at night when you're tired,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.640]   far bigger barrier to getting in that cold shower
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.460]   or cold plunge, unless you are particularly warm
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.880]   because you exited the sauna or exceptionally motivated.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.520]   So the point is to make the water just cold enough
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.840]   that you would kind of retract from it,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.740]   that you don't want to be in it,
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.480]   but not so that it's like an icy burn,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.880]   so cold that it burns.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.960]   This is my opinion.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.660]   I like to do deliberate cold exposure in the following way.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.360]   I don't even do it for time.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.640]   I do it for what I call walls.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.780]   So if you're having a hard time
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.880]   even persuading yourself to get in the thing,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.700]   well, then that's one wall you need to get over.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.880]   And then if you get over that wall, which hopefully you do,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.800]   you get in and you start to breathe very quickly,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   just know that if it's very cold, you'll breathe quickly.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.360]   And after about 20 seconds,
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.880]   your ability to think clearly will come back online.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.120]   Okay, that's right about the time that most people say
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.440]   that their hands or feet hurt.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.240]   Okay, I do recommend putting your hands under.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.280]   It's not necessary, but hands and feet under.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.100]   If you're in the shower,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.400]   getting your body as small as possible.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.640]   Sometimes people will huddle in the shower.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.200]   If you really want to make it uncomfortable,
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   you can raise your arms and get in your armpits,
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.960]   which is especially cold.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.160]   But in any case, it should be uncomfortable.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.520]   And then you should stay in until you adapt to that.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.120]   Like, okay, so maybe that's 30 seconds.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.000]   Maybe it's 10 seconds.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.180]   Maybe it's a minute.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.900]   And then I suggest getting out at that point.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.040]   So I would say anywhere from one to three minutes
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.800]   for most people, maybe 30 seconds,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.520]   if you're really experiencing a lot of mental barriers
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.360]   to getting in there.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.280]   And it should be just cold enough
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.440]   that you don't want to be in there that you want to get out,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.760]   but that you can stay in for that one to three minutes
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.840]   safely.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.680]   Why do I say this?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.240]   Well, if you get into very, very cold water,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.980]   like 30 degree Fahrenheit water,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.000]   and you're and really hyperventilating,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.760]   you do run the risk of hypothermia.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.560]   You run the risk of putting your, you know,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.260]   your cardiovascular system into shock.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.740]   I mean, there is a real danger to these things.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.540]   And by the way, you should never, ever,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.640]   ever do any kind of breath work
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.220]   prior to getting into deliberate cold, okay?
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.540]   Prior to getting into very cold water.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.720]   Because if you're doing a lot of exhaling,
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.820]   you're blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.300]   that will limit your gas reflex.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.020]   And there have been people who have done, you know,
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.860]   cyclic hyperventilation, deep breathing,
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.700]   then gone into water,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.940]   and they didn't realize that they needed to breathe.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.260]   They didn't get that gas reflex early enough.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.080]   And unfortunately they blacked out and died.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.400]   So that's very serious.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.240]   So what do I recommend in terms of cold water?
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.600]   Great to have somebody there.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.280]   Ideally, you have somebody there with you
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.360]   who's not in the water with you, who can monitor you.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   If you're talking about cold shower or cold plunge,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.380]   and you're talking about, okay,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.320]   should I do it at 40 degrees or 45 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.720]   or 50 degrees?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.600]   Well, put your hand in and then ask yourself
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.040]   on a scale of one to 10, how eager am I to get in?
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.440]   If it's 10, well, then it's probably a little too warm,
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.060]   or maybe you're just highly motivated.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.980]   If it's a five or a six,
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.980]   and you're kind of feeling some resistance, great,
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.940]   provided it's not so cold that it's dangerous.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.540]   So for me, the typical temperature,
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:21.740]   if you just want me to throw one out there,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.580]   is somewhere between 45 and 50 degrees.
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.080]   And a few of my friends who really like it extra cold
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.100]   or like an ice bath will say, oh, that's weak.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.500]   Well, that's what works for me.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.700]   I never liked the cold.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.740]   I love getting out of it.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.560]   Sometimes I like being in there after a little while,
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.820]   but I never like getting into it.
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.740]   I much prefer heat and the sauna.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.800]   And while we're here,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.000]   I'll just mention how hot for the sauna.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.220]   Again, same thing,
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.420]   hot enough that you feel little uncomfortable,
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.460]   but not so hot that you put yourself in danger.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.260]   And here we really have to emphasize danger
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.640]   because it doesn't take much of a temperature increase
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.700]   to overheat the brain.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.900]   So for me, I'm pretty heat tolerant.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.700]   So I'll put the traditional sauna, not infrared sauna,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.660]   but traditional sauna to about 210,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.740]   and I'll last about 10 to 20 minutes in there maximum.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.820]   And then I'll go into the cold plunge and back and forth.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.640]   Okay?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.080]   If you're going to do the cold plunge for the first time,
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.080]   maybe start at 55, 60 degrees and stay in a little longer.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.720]   If you're going to be more experienced with this
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.320]   and you're more cold tolerant, try 45, 50.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.720]   And then if you're really aggressive
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.960]   and you want to try getting down into the low 40s or so,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.800]   high 30s,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.520]   well then make sure you have somebody there
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.960]   and make sure that you don't force yourself
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.440]   to do something that's going to cause tissue damage
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.620]   or cardiovascular damage.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.800]   Cold is a very potent stimulus
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.680]   and you should go with the minimum effective dose,
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.360]   but you don't have to obsess over the difference
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.720]   between 58 degrees and 56 degrees or 46 and 48.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.520]   I think subjective feel is going to help.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.600]   Just make sure that you build in some safeties
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.120]   so that you can adjust quickly, stay out of danger.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.340]   No deep breathing prior to getting in there.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.560]   Now, some of you might be asking,
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.040]   well, what about deep breathing while I'm in there?
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.180]   That's how I calm myself down.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.560]   That's fine,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.240]   but no emphasizing the exhales to blow off carbon dioxide.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.720]   Certainly no submerging yourself intentionally.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   Okay?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.760]   So be safe, have fun with it.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.160]   Deliberate cold exposure,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.840]   I think is a wonderful tool for increasing alertness,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.760]   not just while you're in there,
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   but when you get out.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.660]   In fact, that's the best part.
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.680]   If you ask me, it is getting out.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.600]   All right.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.620]   Next question is from Katie.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.960]   It's about self-motivation.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.320]   Do you have any suggestions or steps to self-motivate
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.440]   to start a new routine?
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.520]   I do.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.680]   I do, I do, I do.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.660]   First of all, be very careful who you announce
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.120]   and what you announce to people
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.620]   in terms of starting a new routine.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.680]   Unless they are going to really be on you
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.360]   about accountability in general,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.960]   talking to people about our goals,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.040]   less effective in my opinion,
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.240]   and then there's some research to support this,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   then just simply making the decision,
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.080]   writing it down, simple, you know,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.120]   old school like me, eight and a half by 11 paper,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.560]   write down what the goal is.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.440]   Give yourself a check for each day that you do it
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.080]   or the times of day that you do it.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.520]   Sometimes signing your signature
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.640]   as if you have a contract with yourself can help.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   These are all different tricks.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.480]   Some people will say,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.400]   should you reward yourself for completing something?
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.240]   Sure.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.940]   Should you scare yourself into doing something?
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.780]   Sure.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.820]   There's data to support that also.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.740]   I covered this in the episode with Emily Balcedas
[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.820]   and about goal seeking and habits
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.400]   that I did as solo episodes.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.460]   We have a newsletter on this.
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.720]   Here's the deal.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.620]   There are going to be multiple barriers
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.740]   to starting a new routine.
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.660]   I do believe in incremental approaches to these things.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.940]   Right now, I'm working on some bonus chapters of my book.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.980]   And while I'm a pretty motivated person,
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.100]   I'm excited to share that information with the world.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.040]   I must say that setting aside time
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.960]   to do these bonus chapters has been challenging
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.140]   because I've got a lot else going on.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.980]   So rather than tell people that I'm doing that,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.400]   I actually have a contract with myself
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.380]   that I sign each time I complete anywhere
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.720]   from a 10 to 60 minute writing block.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.660]   So a contract with yourself can really help.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.540]   I think it's far more valuable than stating to the world
[00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.280]   what you're going to do.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.860]   I don't know why that tends to work,
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.620]   but we know why stating to the world
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.260]   what you're going to do often wears off
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.300]   because typically, and this reflects both good and bad
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.220]   things about human behavior and psychology,
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.560]   typically people will support you by saying,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.020]   "Great, you're going to do great.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.940]   The book's going to be great."
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.980]   Or, "Your new exercise program is going to be great.
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:17.820]   You're going to do."
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.820]   And they're just supporting you, supporting you,
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.940]   supporting you.
[00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.780]   And that support turns out to be sufficient
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.100]   to create this mindset that you could do it at any point
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.340]   where you've got the support you need.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.920]   Sometimes a little bit of additional friction,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.100]   what Tim Ferriss would call fear setting, is a good idea.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.700]   You think about worst outcomes if you don't do the thing.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.300]   But let's face it, you can't lie to yourself and believe it.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.900]   So if you know that not doing the thing
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.540]   isn't going to markedly change your life for the worse,
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.460]   well, in that case, you need some additional support.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.820]   You need some additional motivation.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.280]   So you could use all sorts of tools and protocols
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.480]   like a cold shower to increase epinephrine,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.620]   adrenaline, and dopamine,
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.980]   and get more motivated and then do something.
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.460]   You could, and I think this is probably the best tool
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.420]   anyone could apply, which would be to put away your phone,
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.980]   turn it off, put it in the other room.
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.180]   I now have a box for my phone that I've dedicated
[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.260]   to keeping my phone in when I'm busy doing
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.420]   other types of work for which the presence of the phone
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.020]   would be an intrusion, it would limit my work output.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.780]   I do think that the contract with self
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.660]   is going to be the best way.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.580]   You say, I am going to do 30 minutes of whatever,
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.960]   resistance training three times a week,
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.420]   and then you're going to sign off by the end of the week.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.500]   And when you complete each one,
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.700]   that's your reward to yourself that you were accountable.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.740]   There's no external reward.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:29.820]   Why do I say this?
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.200]   The work itself should become the reward.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.820]   We know this from all the work on growth mindset
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.060]   that we've talked about, Carol Dweck's wonderful work,
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.580]   and David Yeager's wonderful work.
[00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.740]   He was a guest on the podcast.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.700]   I've done solo episodes about their work
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.220]   about growth mindset,
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.900]   that ultimately the work becoming the reward
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.820]   is how you're going to sustain motivation over time.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.500]   So when you sign off that you did the work
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.060]   and that's the reward,
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.740]   well, then there's this kind of cyclical relationship
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.220]   between what you've promised yourself you would do,
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.840]   what you did, and rewarding yourself for the work.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.580]   No additional external reward, the work becomes a reward.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.780]   So I like the idea of being a bit of a,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.220]   what we would call closed loop system on motivation,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.940]   rather than going out and seeking
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.660]   excessive support from others.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.300]   And I say this not to isolate,
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.480]   I encourage healthy relationships, et cetera.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.460]   But if we start seeking external validation or pressure
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.920]   in order to do what we know we want to do
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.420]   or would love to be able to do without external support,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.680]   we limit ourselves.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.860]   And when that support isn't there,
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.360]   we tend to be far less productive
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:38.100]   and move toward our goals far less well.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.540]   So it's an internal process of reshaping your psychology.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.780]   There's also some deeper psychology around this stuff
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.940]   of agency and what you feel you deserve.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.760]   You deserve, I'll tell you this,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.680]   'cause I believe everyone deserves
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.520]   to be able to better themselves
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.940]   through these kinds of self-directed actions.
[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.420]   And I also like the idea of a closed loop
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.000]   because you can be really honest with yourself
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.840]   at the end of a week.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.340]   Did you do your three sessions?
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.120]   Did you sign off three times?
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.820]   Keeping some of that reward system and validation internal
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.940]   really helps you become stronger
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.860]   also to be able to support other people
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:12.900]   if they need your support.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.260]   Whereas if you have a committee of people that you rely on,
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.340]   you know, that you need to hear from,
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.440]   you need their support in order to be motivated.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.460]   While that can be great, coaches can be great
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.300]   and support systems are wonderful.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.540]   I don't think it's nearly as effective
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.840]   as being your own committee,
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.080]   your own chair and secretary in this case,
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.800]   and member of your own committee.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.760]   And then of course, seek social support
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.380]   and reinforcement for other areas of your life that you need
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:43.120]   and be a source of social support,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.920]   but also encourage people to be in this kind of
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.160]   self-cyclical loop of motivation
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.480]   and to really impart the principles of growth mindset,
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.720]   which is really what we're talking about.
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.400]   Make the effort, the reward.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.800]   Okay, I'm going to take a sip of tea here.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.560]   Lou asks, what can you do
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.140]   if you're not getting enough rapid eye movement sleep?
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.120]   What are the consequences?
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.200]   Okay, so to remind everybody,
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.880]   rapid eye movement sleep is more enriched
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.060]   towards the end of the night.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.940]   It differs from slow wave sleep or deep sleep.
[00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.340]   Tends to be dream rich sleep.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.880]   The dreams tend to be more elaborate.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.820]   You also dream during deep sleep, during slow wave sleep,
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.260]   but your dreams are far more emotionally laden
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.240]   during rapid eye movement sleep, more vivid, et cetera.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   And rapid eye movement sleep is associated with learning.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.500]   So getting enough rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.620]   especially on the first night
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.260]   after trying to learn something is important.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.460]   Rapid eye movement sleep is also important
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.020]   for removing the emotional load of previous day
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.860]   and previous days experiences.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.080]   So it's its own form of trauma therapy.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.620]   During rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.200]   your body is essentially incapable of releasing adrenaline.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.420]   So you can have these very intense
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.280]   emotional experiences in your mind.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.580]   Without adrenaline in your body,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.540]   you're actually paralyzed during rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.220]   It's a healthy paralysis, sleep atonia it's called.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.200]   How do you get more REM sleep?
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.340]   Well, one of the best ways to get more REM sleep
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.940]   is to simply add anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.180]   to your sleep schedule,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.220]   adding that 10 to 30 minutes in the morning.
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.220]   Most people can't do that, however.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.340]   Another way to increase the amount
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.340]   of rapid eye movement sleep that you get
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:28.580]   is to get a bigger surge of epinephrine of adrenaline
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.520]   in the early day prior to that sleep.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.180]   So this is a great reason to do deliberate cold exposure
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.220]   in your shower in the morning.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.840]   You could also get it through exercise.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.500]   So exercising early in the morning,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.220]   and then we're talking about the rapid eye movement sleep
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.940]   that occurs the very next, that same night, okay?
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.160]   So we're talking about a Monday morning
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.520]   where you exercise and get deliberate cold exposure.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.980]   By the way, it is true that if you do deliberate
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.940]   cold exposure after resistance training,
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.300]   you can limit some of the strength
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.860]   and hypertrophy increases or adaptations,
[00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.900]   but at other times it seems to be fine.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.340]   And there is zero evidence that taking a cold shower
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.380]   after resistance training is going to limit
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.340]   strength or hypertrophy adaptation.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.780]   So you don't have to be too paranoid
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.780]   about deliberate cold exposure.
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.820]   In fact, I think the best recommendation I can make
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.660]   about deliberate cold exposure is neither be too paranoid
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.340]   nor too obsessive about it.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.640]   So spiking your adrenaline a bit
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.760]   in the early part of the day with exercise
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.000]   and or deliberate cold exposure can help get
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.240]   more rapid eye movement sleep later that night.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.500]   Sleeping in a bit, even 10 minutes more going back to sleep.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.960]   This is a case for hitting the snooze.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.800]   You go back to sleep, maybe even two or three times.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.980]   Of course, better to just sleep the whole way through
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.960]   until maximum long night is achieved,
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.440]   long night of sleep that is.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.680]   If you wake up and you're not rested enough,
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.100]   or if you're looking at your sleep score
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.400]   and you don't see enough rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.300]   the other thing you can do is a non-sleep deep rest protocol,
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.580]   which by the way, Matt Walker's laboratory
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.540]   and I are gearing up to do some studies
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.580]   on non-sleep deep rest and how it impacts the brain
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.780]   specifically as opposed,
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.380]   and this has been done in other studies,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.700]   but not with modern methods in a while.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.500]   So we're excited about that.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.300]   So do a 10 to 30 minute or 10 or 20 minute
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.780]   non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.840]   Those are easy to find.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.900]   I have zero cost ones that are on YouTube.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.620]   You simply put NSDR Huberman.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.780]   There's a 10 minute one, a 20 minute one.
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.340]   We have them in Spotify format.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.340]   There's actually a link on the hubermanlab.com webpage
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.780]   that links out to audio format
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.180]   so that you don't have to go onto YouTube.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.020]   If you don't want to do that,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.380]   you can download that script from Spotify.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.060]   And that way you have it in your phone.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.980]   You don't need to even have internet access.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.300]   So if you're camping or you're out of internet access,
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.980]   you can still do that non-sleep deep rest.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.120]   And then if you prefer a female voice, Kelly Boyes,
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.060]   B-O-Y-S has some wonderful NSDR and Yoga Nidra scripts
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.460]   on YouTube and has her own.
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.460]   She also is on the waking up app doing NSDR and Yoga Nidra.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.980]   So I would do that first thing in the morning
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.860]   to get a bit more REM like rest
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.260]   is what we'll call it until the data are in.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.380]   REM like rest puts the brain into this very interesting
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.740]   state with body completely still, right?
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.940]   Similar to sleep atonia that you observe in REM sleep
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.460]   and mind active, very similar to REM sleep.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.560]   This is actually our hypothesis,
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.320]   which is that non-sleep deep rest mimics
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.380]   rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.100]   But that hypothesis still needs to be tested formally.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:25.460]   And Dr. Walker and I are going to do that.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.580]   So that's another way to get more REM sleep.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.760]   The other way, and this is kind of a tongue in cheek answer
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.180]   is if you don't get enough REM sleep on one night,
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.620]   you can be sure that if you allow yourself
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.760]   sufficient sleep the next night,
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.320]   you'll get more REM sleep than you normally would anyway,
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.920]   had you slept well the previous night.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.200]   What does all that mean?
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.840]   Means that there's something called the REM sleep rebound.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.640]   If you don't sleep enough or you don't get enough REM sleep
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.080]   on say Monday night, Tuesday night, when you go to sleep,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.320]   provided you didn't blitz your system with caffeine,
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.040]   you're not ingesting anything that would disrupt
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.080]   your REM sleep, such as caffeine late in the day.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.880]   Well, or alcohol,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.380]   which will disrupt REM sleep dramatically.
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:11.460]   Well, then you will get more REM sleep on Tuesday night.
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.480]   Okay, there's a REM compensation.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.080]   Anyone that's tracked their sleep has observed this.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.040]   So that's another way.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.640]   Right now, there's no clear pharmacology
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.180]   to induce more REM sleep, unfortunately.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.720]   There are some tools to increase slow-wave sleep,
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.960]   deep sleep pharmacologically.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.600]   Some of the growth hormone secretogogs
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   that are in common peptides will do that.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.140]   But right now, there doesn't seem to be any pharmacology
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.700]   directed specifically at increasing REM sleep.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.060]   There are a few, these go by brand names like Quivivic
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.820]   and things like that, that are thought to do this,
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.740]   but it's still somewhat debated as to whether or not
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.800]   they specifically increase REM sleep.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.140]   Danielle says, "The top three most impactful things
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.780]   schools could do to raise student capacity for learning."
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.540]   What a great question.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.200]   Well, I'll add a fourth because I don't want to,
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.760]   I don't want to try and wriggle out of the question
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.400]   by just saying sleep again.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   But I think trying to get kids to sleep enough
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.360]   is going to be key.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.960]   So that means off phones and iPads
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.800]   in the middle of the night.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   That means starting school a little bit later.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.300]   I don't know if that's ever going to work,
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.120]   but that would be a marvelous thing for learning
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.940]   because as you know, or we all should know or remember,
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.480]   neuroplasticity and learning is triggered
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.320]   by focused attention, which is supported
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.780]   by having slept well the night before.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.160]   But the actual rewiring of neural connections
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.220]   occurs when?
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.080]   It occurs during sleep.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.120]   It occurs during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.080]   That's when the reorganization of neural connections occurs,
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.400]   the strengthening of particular synapses,
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.080]   the weakening of other synapses.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.060]   And there's a small, small, small,
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.240]   perhaps infinitesimally small percentage of neuroplasticity
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.160]   that is the consequence of the addition of new neurons.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.320]   So most neuroplasticity is not that,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.080]   most neuroplasticity is the reorganization
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.180]   of existing neural connections.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.080]   But nonetheless, that happens during sleep.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.000]   So getting kids to sleep enough, nap enough,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.020]   sleep late if they need to is actually a great thing.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.220]   But who knows if schools will change their protocols?
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   What else can we do?
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.340]   What can schools do?
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.220]   Well, I'm a big fan, as you know, of non-sleep deep rest.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.700]   Wouldn't it be wonderful if in every school
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.420]   that started the day with a five minute meditation
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.940]   or non-sleep deep rest,
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.620]   where kids would do some quiet focused breathing,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.700]   bringing their attention back to their breathing,
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.020]   bringing their attention back to the spot
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.020]   just behind their forehead,
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.620]   just before beginning a learning session.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.660]   Why? Why?
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.520]   Is it about mysticism? No.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.380]   Is it about trying to understand consciousness? No.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.540]   It's about a study done by Wendy Suzuki's Laboratory
[00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.740]   at New York University.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.540]   She's their current Dean of Letters and Science
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.000]   as far as I know.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.680]   She's a neuroscientist.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.980]   She has a spectacular record
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.460]   in the field of neuroscience and psychology.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:03.520]   And her laboratory showed
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.700]   that even a very brief meditation session
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.340]   in that particular study, it was about 13 minutes per day,
[00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.380]   can significantly improve working memory,
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.140]   which is the ability to keep information online
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.540]   in one's mind active.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.780]   It can increase other forms of memory.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.940]   It can increase focus.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.740]   It can decrease stress.
[00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.420]   And it is a zero cost tool.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.540]   So I think, unfortunately,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.660]   we think of meditation as a mystical tool
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.260]   to explore consciousness, and it can be.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.420]   But if you think about it,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.620]   exercise can also be an ultra marathon
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.860]   to run 242 miles or something to win a trophy,
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.940]   or it can be something to improve cardiovascular health.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.220]   So similarly, meditation is just a perceptual exercise.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.380]   I think that if kids learn
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.420]   that they can bring their perception internally
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.420]   to what we call interoception,
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:56.380]   as opposed to looking at things externally, exteroception,
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:58.020]   understand that they have some control,
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.080]   some regulation over their focus and attention,
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.300]   bringing their attention back to them,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.100]   to interoception, whenever it drifts,
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.700]   well, then they get better at focus over time,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.220]   and it improves learning in the long-term,
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.600]   but also in the bout of learning
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.380]   that they go into immediately after.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.700]   So, you know, if I had a magic wand,
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.740]   every classroom would begin a session of learning
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.340]   with five minutes or maybe even three minutes
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.660]   of what is typically known as third eye
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.460]   or focused meditation with no interest in mysticism,
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.660]   pure interest in improving the bout of learning.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.660]   I think another thing that a school should include
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.220]   to increase capacity for learning
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.420]   is they should include micro gaps.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.780]   So we know that if you take gaps in information delivery,
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.060]   so for instance, if I were to just pause now
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.080]   and then continue, it seems like kind of an odd interruption
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.740]   and then every once in a while at random,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.260]   introduce a short 10 second pause or so,
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.320]   what do we know happens?
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.940]   We know based on now a number of different
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.300]   really high quality papers
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.740]   that have looked at musical learning,
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.260]   mathematical learning, concept learning,
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:13.660]   physical skill learning, that those little micro gaps
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.620]   allow for very rapid replay
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.380]   of the information that's relevant,
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:21.180]   for whatever reason in reverse in the brain,
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.260]   very quickly within the hippocampus
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.140]   and the neocortex areas of the brain,
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.940]   critical for encoding and storage of memories.
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.380]   And these little micro gaps
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:32.620]   and the rapid replay of the information
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.660]   one is trying to learn at 20 to 30 times the normal rate
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.380]   increases the number of repetitions.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.340]   You're basically getting 30 repetitions for doing nothing.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.920]   This is exactly what happens in what?
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.340]   In rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.180]   When you learn something,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.980]   like maybe you learned something today
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.220]   in our discussion thus far and you go to sleep at night,
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.460]   there's a very strong chance
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.900]   that if we were to record from your brain,
[00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.220]   we would see that the same areas of your brain
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.500]   that were active during specific portions
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.620]   of this discussion,
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.340]   which arguably is more of a lecture than a discussion,
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:07.980]   but those brain areas would repeat at 20 to 30 times speed
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.940]   within a very compressed time.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.300]   And then you'd go back to a different pattern
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.140]   of brain activity.
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:13.960]   What is going on?
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.740]   Well, in rapid eye movement sleep, the brain is rehearsing.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.300]   It's generating repetitions of certain forms of behavior
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.800]   and certain forms of learning of cognitive information.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.900]   At high speed, you're generating more repetitions.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.840]   And this is critical for the learning process.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.000]   We know this from animal studies.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.200]   We now know this from human studies as well.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.980]   So if in the classroom teachers would just say,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.060]   okay, we just finished discussing, I don't know,
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.900]   the cell cycle or the Krebs cycle.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.100]   Now let's take a moment.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:46.980]   And students are not checking their phone at that time
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.280]   or reviewing the material at that time.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.940]   They just got 20 to 30 repetitions of,
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.740]   and by the way, at a subconscious level,
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.860]   they're not aware of it,
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.620]   of the material they had just been exposed to.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.780]   And so you introduce these, excuse me, at random.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.280]   You could do anywhere from one to five of these per hour.
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.580]   You could do as many as 10 per hour.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.180]   You're just introducing these brief micro rest intervals.
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.760]   There's a beautiful literature to support this.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.620]   And the third thing, it's very important,
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.660]   is I think it's very, very clear that physical activity,
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:18.880]   in particular, cardiovascular training,
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.240]   any kind of physical activity, running, jogging,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.360]   swimming, et cetera, is going to facilitate learning,
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.740]   especially if the learning is done immediately
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.320]   after that activity.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.720]   That's right, if the learning is done immediately
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.400]   after the activity, and that's probably related
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.560]   to the increase in the various catecholamines,
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.120]   dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.560]   associated with physical activity,
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.000]   then making coding of new memories
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.960]   and coding of new information more readily accessible.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.600]   So this is a call for including PE class
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.920]   or even just some basic movement,
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.720]   even walks or things of that sort.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.300]   We can look at this through the other lens
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.300]   and say, what are the worst things for learning?
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.100]   Terrible sleep, being delivered information
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.860]   like through a fire hose with no pauses.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.980]   And forgive me if from time to time, I tend to do that.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.960]   Maybe I should start introducing micro gaps
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.640]   into the podcast, but you can always just pause it,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.480]   go back to it.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.660]   I feel like real life provides that.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.340]   There is the strong, strong incentive
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.700]   for including some physical movement each day.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.540]   And then I suppose if we were going to include another one,
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:22.100]   we'd say that kids and teachers should have a discussion
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.740]   about optimal learning protocols.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.140]   They should understand where their thresholds are
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.940]   after which their attention falls off.
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.120]   There's really no point in trying to learn information
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.820]   if you're not focused on what you're trying to learn.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.420]   And then there's a whole discussion to be had about caffeine.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:36.180]   There's a whole discussion to be had about nutrition
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.580]   as it relates to maintaining alertness throughout the day.
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.100]   Anyone that's ever gone into a lecture on a college campus
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.420]   or a high school or elementary school, even after lunch,
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.060]   you'll see that people's brains are just kind of idling
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:48.940]   there in the background.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.940]   It's the rare student that's wrapped with attention
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.820]   even after a big lunch, even after running around outside.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:57.940]   So structuring of the day properly is essential.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.980]   And of course, get that sleep at night.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.300]   Okay, Alec, could you share your thoughts
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.840]   on how Shilajit might influence cognitive function
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.680]   and physical health,
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.860]   specifically its impact to boost testosterone?
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.380]   I get a lot of questions about Shilajit.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.200]   Shilajit is a mineral pitch from the Himalayas.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.900]   There are a lot of fake versions out there,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   but the authentic versions are basically,
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:23.460]   this is stuff that basically they take soil and grasses
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.180]   and a bunch of things and they mash it down
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.300]   and they take the extract
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.940]   and they create this stuff called Shilajit,
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.340]   which sometimes is sold as a thick paste,
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.420]   kind of a tar-like paste.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:33.060]   Sometimes it's in capsules.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.660]   What do we know about Shilajit?
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:39.660]   Shilajit contains minerals that are thought to augment
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.400]   some hormone pathways.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.240]   And that's why people have argued,
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.680]   and it's marketed that Shilajit increases vitality.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.160]   It's been argued that Shilajit can increase testosterone,
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.520]   maybe estrogen as well.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.280]   There are actually a few studies on this
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.920]   that are covered at examine.com.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   I'm going to bring up one just now.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.120]   This, we can induce a little gap effect here
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.640]   if there's a pause.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.200]   There is some data, not a ton,
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.080]   but there's some data that support the use of Shilajit
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.920]   for testosterone increase.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.800]   But I would place it on the low end
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.920]   of the effectiveness scale
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   in terms of things to increase testosterone.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.120]   And then of course, the real question is,
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.520]   are you getting enough authentic Shilajit
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.960]   to really have an effect?
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.520]   The dosaging on this is very mysterious.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.800]   In other words, I personally wouldn't place Shilajit
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.420]   high on any list of ways to generate hormone support.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.720]   There are far better ways.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.760]   I mean, the best ways of course,
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.600]   are to make sure that your body fat percentage
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.800]   is neither too high nor too low, okay?
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.600]   The people who are overweight, who are obese,
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.520]   who lose body fat,
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.040]   will improve their hormone profiles dramatically.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.340]   However, people who are already very lean,
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:43.580]   who get excessively lean,
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.120]   you can disrupt testosterone levels dramatically.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.960]   And by the way,
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.880]   anytime there's a discussion about testosterone,
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.720]   I want to remind that both men and women have testosterone.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.040]   It's important in both men and women.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.280]   Yes, it's related to libido,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.560]   but having sufficiently high levels of estrogen
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.960]   in both men and women is also critical for libido.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.660]   People that take drugs like an astrozole
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:06.480]   to disrupt the rheumatase conversion of testosterone
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.880]   into estrogen can sometimes find themselves
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.000]   with reduced libido.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.640]   And that's because estrogen is critical for libido
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.880]   in men and women as is testosterone.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.420]   So it's all about the ratios.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.200]   Going back to Shilajit,
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.380]   let's look at the human effect matrix on Shilajit.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.920]   There is one study here with 60 participants
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   that cites a small increase,
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.680]   small but statistically significant increase
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.240]   in follicle stimulating hormone, FSH,
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.360]   which in females is critical, in males is critical.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.000]   And the extent of the increase is just very small.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.080]   So it's not clear that it would be worth taking Shilajit
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.000]   given the risks and the cost.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.440]   It depends on how aggressive you are
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.200]   in trying to increase testosterone.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.440]   Certainly there are other ways.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.480]   Sperm quality, one study showing a small improvement
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.320]   in sperm quality.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.120]   One study of 60 participants showing a small increase
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.340]   in testosterone.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.560]   So, and then of course,
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.240]   there's a bunch of other things that have been looked at.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.060]   The perhaps most impressive effect
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:09.080]   is a reduction in some LDLs.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:12.000]   But again, even though I say the most impressive,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.120]   it's still a small effect.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.260]   So I wouldn't place Shilajit high on the list
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.920]   of supplements to consider.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.360]   Always, always, always before talking about supplements,
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.520]   you want to get your nutrition right.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.880]   I've talked about how to do this.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.280]   You want to be exercising, but not overtraining.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.840]   You want to do both resistance training
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.900]   and cardiovascular training,
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.240]   maybe on the same day or different days,
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.880]   whatever your schedule allows.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   You want to make sure you get enough sleep at night.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.200]   If you want to increase your testosterone significantly,
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.640]   get an extra 30 to 60 minutes of sleep each night.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.820]   Even a 20 minute increase in rapid eye movement sleep
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.160]   is going to serve your testosterone
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.160]   far better than taking Shilajit.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.320]   Will taking Shilajit increase your vitality?
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.860]   You know, probably increase your energy a bit.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.380]   You might increase libido a bit.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.780]   You have to ask yourself, is it transient?
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.900]   Is that effect transient?
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.200]   Is it directly related to testosterone increases?
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.040]   Probably not.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.040]   It's probably directly related
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.180]   to follicle stimulating hormone increases.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.140]   And for women who have a menstrual cycle that is,
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.820]   you know, obviously going to lead
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.880]   to different constellations of hormones,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.060]   markedly different constellations of hormones,
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:10.180]   such as follicle stimulating hormone,
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.040]   estrogen, progestins, et cetera,
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.740]   different times throughout the cycle,
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.260]   taking something like Shilajit,
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.620]   because it can stimulate FSH release,
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.840]   can potentially disrupt that.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.460]   If you're a male who's doing everything else,
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.040]   like you're exercising, you're sleeping well,
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:27.420]   your nutrition is locked in,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.320]   you are taking creatine and fish oil,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.820]   you're taking care of your gut microbiome,
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.740]   and you want to experiment with Shilajit,
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:37.860]   well, by all means, find a reliable source of Shilajit.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.680]   They are out there.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:43.580]   Just look for one that has some testing for authenticity.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.920]   And then you're likely to be able to see
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.180]   within about a week or so,
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.420]   if it leads to a significant increase in vitality, libido,
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.560]   whatever it is that you're seeking.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.100]   But I wouldn't place Shilajit high
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.340]   on the list of things to pursue.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.860]   And I will also say, having tried Shilajit,
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.900]   it's pretty messy.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:02.500]   It's hard to get the dosaging right in the tar form.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.900]   The capsules make it a little bit easier.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.640]   If you wanted to explore other ways to augment testosterone
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.820]   that have a bit more data to support them,
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.560]   I would say things like Tonga Ali,
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.940]   which may have its effects on increasing libido
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.340]   in both men and women by virtue of increasing testosterone
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.700]   or maybe free testosterone, more likely,
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.420]   it's an increase in luteinizing hormone in that case,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.060]   which is upstream of testosterone.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.220]   So this can all get into some pretty extended discussions
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.340]   about biochemical pathways and hormone pathways.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.900]   I did this on the episode
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.840]   about optimizing testosterone and estrogen
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.260]   as a solo episode that I also covered
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.260]   with Dr. Kyle Gillette and with Dr. Peter Attia.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.020]   By the way, if you go to hubermanlab.com
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.620]   and you put in any combination of search items,
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.100]   if you put, for instance, Shilajit testosterone,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.840]   it will take you to the timestamp that covers that.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.100]   If you put Tonga Ali testosterone or libido,
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.780]   Tonga Ali will take you to the timestamps
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.140]   across different episodes directly to those timestamps
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.820]   so that you don't have to listen to entire episodes
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.200]   or go searching for this information.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.040]   It's all there.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.500]   We also have an AI engine at hubermanlab.com
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.660]   that allows you to do searches on this sort of thing.
[00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.400]   But of course, I'm happy to talk to you about it as well.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.460]   I'm delighted to.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.980]   So again, if you have the budget
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.740]   and you're somebody who likes to experiment,
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.180]   maybe Shilajit is the right thing for you.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.020]   Find a good brand.
[00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.160]   It shouldn't be hard to distinguish the real brands.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.100]   They always have a label of authentication on there.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.100]   And if you're going to already be doing
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.900]   everything else right behaviorally
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.340]   and you want to explore supplementation
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:32.420]   for improving testosterone, vitality, et cetera,
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.940]   then I would say, don't start with Shilajit.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.660]   You'd probably be best off starting with something
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.560]   like Tonga Ali, maybe Fidogia.
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.900]   I've talked about these things previously.
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.740]   Okay.
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.780]   Let's see.
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.100]   Two questions popped up in front of me.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.700]   So I'll just take the first one.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:48.580]   Alexander, Alexander.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.180]   I like the way you spell your name, Alexander.
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.000]   It's unusual.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:51.860]   I dig it.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.260]   What has your process been for the writing of your book?
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.100]   - Slow.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:01.300]   I have a saying that I say in my lab
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.660]   or that I have said for many years in doing science
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.300]   when I was a graduate student, a postdoc,
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.540]   and then in my lab.
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.740]   And by the way, 'cause sometimes people ask about this,
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.680]   I still have research funds for human studies.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.380]   I closed my animal lab, focusing mainly on teaching,
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.220]   which I'll be doing again this year.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.580]   I'm teaching in the spring,
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.680]   maybe in the winter as well to undergraduates.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.680]   And I may get re-involved in some human clinical studies
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.340]   on vision, an area that I've loved for many years.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.180]   But in any case,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.660]   there's a saying that I always would reiterate
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.780]   to my students in postdocs,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.620]   which is I go as fast as I carefully can.
[00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:39.460]   Okay.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.300]   So I believe in a sense of urgency.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.060]   I like to sit down to write and think, okay,
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.140]   I'm going to go as fast as I carefully can.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.860]   It's that right balance between urgency and precision.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.700]   Okay.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.880]   Going fast is rarely good in its own right.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.980]   Going too slow isn't good either.
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.380]   So there's that place where I feel like
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.900]   I'm just pushing myself a little bit,
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.380]   but then you have to be careful, right?
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.520]   So as fast as you carefully can.
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.000]   So the process has been slow,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.600]   but I've been going as fast as I carefully can.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.780]   Any recommendations on overcoming obstacles
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.120]   and how did you deal with them?
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.040]   Yes, put that phone away, put it in the other room.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.280]   If you have to generate accountability measures, do it.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.480]   When I used to write grants in my laboratory in San Diego,
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.320]   you can ask my lab.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.300]   I used to walk in and say, okay,
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.860]   I'm giving my phone to somebody.
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:27.080]   And if I ask for it back before 5 p.m. today,
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.400]   you each get $1,000.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.680]   And I did not have $1,000 to give everyone in my lab.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.960]   I had a pretty big lab and I didn't have the money.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.840]   So you may have to create some barriers
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.380]   and gosh, about an hour and a half in, I'd think, okay, gosh,
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.940]   I was supposed to respond to this person today.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:41.460]   They're going to think that I've dropped off the map.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.300]   Oh my goodness.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.440]   And then I'd remember, oh, I have an office phone.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.880]   Someone really need to get ahold of me.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.200]   If it was an emergency, they'd let me know.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.940]   And if I couldn't be reached that way, someone would find me.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.680]   I realized for people with kids, et cetera,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.440]   this might not be feasible, but if you have to do that,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:56.920]   you do that, set stakes, okay?
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.560]   Give someone a check for an exorbitant amount of money
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.320]   that you can't afford to give away,
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.680]   but that you do have in your bank account,
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.320]   give them that check and say,
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   if I don't stop writing for the next hour,
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.600]   then you can tear up the check.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.860]   Otherwise you can go cash it.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.440]   So you can put some fear in there.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.040]   But again, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.240]   it's better to generate these kind of incentives
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:20.160]   with yourself.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.100]   So I like to put my phone away.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.220]   I like to take about 10 minutes
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.900]   to transition into the writing.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.820]   And then I actually set rules for myself.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.460]   I don't allow myself to get out of the seat,
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.520]   even to use the bathroom.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.720]   It's true.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.040]   I've never gone to the bathroom in my seat,
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.420]   but I resist the temptation to get up
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.980]   until the timer goes off.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:39.440]   That's how I did it as an undergraduate.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.700]   That's how I did it writing grants.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.320]   That's how I've done it writing fellowships
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.700]   as a graduate student.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.340]   And that's how I write the book now.
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.020]   And I find that after about 20, 30 minutes,
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.040]   I don't want to stand up.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.060]   I'm super happy.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.500]   And then if an interruption comes,
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.440]   then I get frustrated because I want to keep writing.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.280]   So give it a try.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.220]   Set some high stakes incentives for yourself.
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.120]   I mean, don't make them too high,
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.140]   but set some high stakes incentive.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.740]   Thank you for saying, looking forward to the book.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.820]   I appreciate it.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.300]   If you want to buy a pre-order copy,
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.820]   it's protocolsbook.com.
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.420]   It's there in multiple languages now.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:12.500]   I'd be grateful if you did.
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:14.180]   On the other hand, if you don't want to buy it,
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.500]   or you just want to wait till it comes out, that's fine too.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.340]   And I'm just grateful that I have the opportunity
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.140]   to put this information into one place
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.580]   that people can access if they like.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.420]   Mike Torres.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.500]   And I think this is the last question, right?
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.300]   Are we down to about the last question?
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:30.180]   Two more, one more.
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.220]   All right, here we go.
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.620]   I'm asking my producer here.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.180]   Mike, where can I find information from Huberman Lab
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.660]   regarding addictions and recovery?
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.980]   Great, great question.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.500]   I get this a lot.
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.140]   A lot of people struggle with addiction.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.780]   Addiction is a progressive narrowing
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.380]   of the things that bring you pleasure
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.260]   in ways that can be very disruptive for your life.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.820]   These can be process addictions,
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.860]   meaning behavioral addictions.
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.460]   These can be substance abuse issues.
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.460]   First of all, I just want to say,
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.780]   while I have no formal relationship to them,
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:59.520]   you know, there are wonderful zero-cost resources
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.820]   in every city around the world, 12-step communities.
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.180]   Go online, look for that.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.060]   The meetings and programs that they provide are very useful,
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:08.280]   have proven very useful.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.320]   Actually, this was explored in a study
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.140]   from Stanford Psychiatry a few years ago,
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.180]   because there hadn't been a lot of science
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:15.240]   on those sorts of programs,
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.580]   and the conclusion was they can be very, very useful.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:20.060]   In terms of Huberman Lab resources,
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.380]   if you go to hubermanlab.com,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.540]   put addiction into the search function,
[00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.000]   it will take you to specific timestamps,
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.580]   mainly of an episode that I did with Dr. Anna Lembke,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.940]   who is our director
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.180]   of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic at Stanford,
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.740]   the author of "Dopamine Nation,"
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:36.840]   an absolute virtuoso in terms of the description
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.740]   of the underlying biological mechanisms,
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:41.780]   mostly surrounding dopamine,
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.220]   but also the approach to treating
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:47.540]   and getting over addictions.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.420]   You can get over addictions.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.220]   People get sober from their addictions.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:53.780]   It takes time, it takes energy, it takes effort,
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.580]   and in every case, it's an incredibly rewarding thing
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.780]   that just makes your life and other people's lives better.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.960]   So I highly encourage anyone that's struggling
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.700]   with process addictions or substance abuse addictions
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.060]   or alcohol use disorder or things of that sort
[00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.140]   to pursue those resources, both on our website
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.460]   and, of course, the other resources
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.900]   that I mentioned a few minutes ago.
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:16.220]   Also, Anna's book, "Dopamine Nation," is a wonderful one.
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:19.420]   It will allow you to see and understand
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.360]   that these are brain mechanisms that are at play.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.780]   These are not, it's not a lack of willpower.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.680]   It's a disruption in neurochemical circuit regulation,
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.220]   and that should give you some grace
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.460]   and some feelings of ease,
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.620]   because what that means is that while it is not,
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.260]   quote-unquote, your fault,
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.820]   it is your responsibility to deal with it, and you can,
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.020]   and there are great zero-cost resources to do that,
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.500]   so please access those.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   And then just popped up on my screen,
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.420]   it says, "Happy birthday, Karen Diengar."
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.100]   I hope I pronounced that correctly.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.940]   Happy birthday, Karen, and happy birthday
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.260]   to anyone else whose birthday happens to be today
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.220]   or in the vicinity of today.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:05.420]   I guess this is going to be recorded and put out eventually,
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.700]   and then it'll be somebody's birthday on every day
[00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.980]   at some point, but happy birthday, Karen.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.340]   Thank you for being a premium subscriber.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.700]   Thank you all for tuning in.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.660]   Thank you to those of you that listened to this
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.780]   at a later time recorded.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.500]   I really appreciate your questions.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.000]   I really appreciate your support of Huberman Lab.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.460]   As I've said many times before, it's a labor of love.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.340]   It continues to be a labor of love.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:31.060]   I spend my life, my, basically all of my waking life
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.300]   minus some self-care and some care of others,
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.500]   and hopefully a bulldog soon, another bulldog soon.
[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:39.540]   I can't wait, I've been looking for bulldogs,
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.020]   and there will be another one soon.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:43.060]   I don't know his or her name will be,
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:46.500]   but in the absence of tending to those things,
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.860]   I'm focusing 98% of my waking life
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.540]   to trying to suss out the best health
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.460]   and science information for you all
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.100]   and get it out to you in formats that are convenient for you,
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.900]   that are useful for you, and that you can apply.
[00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.260]   Also discussions with expert guests.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.060]   So there are the guest episodes, the solo episodes.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:09.660]   There's hubermanlab.com has a lot of resources
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.220]   like the AI Engine, please give that a try if you like.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:13.860]   It's basically an AI version of me,
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:14.860]   which is kind of weird to me,
[00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.340]   but it does a pretty good job.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.600]   I would say it does a very good job
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.860]   of encapsulating a lot of themes.
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.020]   It's a great way to generate your own brief protocols
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.860]   if you want to do that.
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.880]   You can ask it to generate a exercise plan
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.740]   based on Huberman Lab protocols or what have you.
[00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:30.180]   And then the newsletters,
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.380]   I'm assuming most of you already subscribe to,
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.820]   but if you would be so kind as to make sure
[00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.580]   that you follow the podcast by clicking subscribe on YouTube,
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.580]   following the podcast on Apple and Spotify,
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.660]   just click, if you already follow, by the way,
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.380]   make sure you don't accidentally unfollow.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.700]   But if you go click that follow tab, that really helps us.
[00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:48.800]   It's zero cost.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.920]   Give us a five-star review if you think we deserve it,
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:52.840]   or different review if you think we deserve that.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.200]   I love your comments on YouTube.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.060]   I do read them all.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.340]   I really do read them all.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.540]   I even go and find the hidden comments that get filtered
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.220]   and I read those too.
[00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.080]   So please, if you feel inclined,
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.380]   you can support us in that way.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.220]   And most importantly,
[00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.860]   take the protocols and the information
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.860]   that you think works for you, apply it,
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.960]   discard the protocols and the information
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.500]   that you don't feel is for you.
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.160]   Discard it, that's great.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.220]   And of course, I don't deserve credit
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.180]   for any of these protocols per se, right?
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.820]   These are the product of so much great science
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.800]   and health studies out there, clinical studies,
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:27.180]   and I'm just a funnel in a filter,
[00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.180]   but it is a true pleasure to be able to be
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.580]   that funnel and filter.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.220]   So thank you for letting me funnel and filter
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.940]   today's knowledge for you.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:38.520]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
