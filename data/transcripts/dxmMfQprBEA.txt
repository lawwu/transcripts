[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.280]   - Pastor John, there are some fairly common
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.320]   and popular phrases that we hear occasionally.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.880]   Phrases like this,
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.540]   work like an Armenian, sleep like a Calvinist.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.700]   Or sometimes it's said, pray like an Armenian,
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.100]   but sleep like a Calvinist.
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.000]   Or sometimes it's said, evangelize like an Armenian,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.720]   but sleep like a Calvinist.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.040]   What do you make of these phrases?
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.520]   - Well, each one of those is a little bit different.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.800]   I don't like any of them.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.080]   And let me focus on the first one.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.160]   I think it was first when you said,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420]   work like an Armenian, sleep like a Calvinist.
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.960]   The other two, I think, have the same kind of simple answer.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960]   You know, evangelize like an Armenian
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.000]   and pray like an Armenian, not like a Calvinist.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.120]   Sort of imply that poor Calvinists,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.940]   they don't have any motive for evangelism and prayer
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.080]   because God rules everything.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.640]   But I think in answering the first one,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.620]   the others will be more clear.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.760]   The reason I don't like saying,
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840]   work like an Armenian and pray like a Calvinist
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.440]   is because I just think it's unhelpful and misleading,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040]   both historically in the effect
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.440]   that the reform vision had on the world,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   and biblically, it's just misleading because of many texts.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.620]   But what occurs to me is that there are listeners
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.940]   who may not even know what those terms mean.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.940]   So let me sketch that out and then try to tackle it.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.380]   So get this term, Arminian and Calvinist.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.840]   And here's the key difference for me.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.060]   Historic Arminians believe, with Calvinists,
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.020]   that people are so sinful and rebellious
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.820]   that they can't believe in Jesus without divine grace.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.420]   We both agree on that.
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.380]   But Arminians say that God gives this grace,
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.940]   prevenient grace, coming before grace,
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.940]   to everybody so that now they have the ability to believe.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.060]   And in this way, the decisive cause of faith is us,
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.660]   and not God.
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.220]   God gets us started, puts us into a position
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.580]   where we can do the necessary believing,
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.900]   and then waits, and we provide
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.820]   the decisive awakening of faith.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.820]   Now, Calvinists agree that you can't believe
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.740]   without divine grace, but we say that the function
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.580]   of that grace is decisive.
[00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.500]   It doesn't just make it possible for a man
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.260]   to decisively produce his own faith,
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.420]   but God decisively defeats all obstacles
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.020]   and makes Christ compelling and beautiful
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.180]   so that the heart is decisively moved
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.600]   to embrace Christ freely on the basis
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.300]   of what the eyes of the heart see.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.500]   So one of the corollaries of the Arminian view
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.400]   is that a person can be a genuine believer
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.920]   with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   and lose that standing and be lost.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.280]   Now, Calvinists don't believe that.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.640]   Don't believe that a person can believe,
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.000]   be decisively brought to faith by God,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   have his rebellion decisively overcome by God,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.660]   and then God switch around and stop providing
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.180]   that decisive victory.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.080]   God's faithfulness to those whom he called
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.400]   out of darkness into light is the ground
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.460]   of our confidence in eternal security.
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.580]   And my guess is that one of the reasons
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.380]   at the street level that people are inclined
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.020]   to think Arminians work harder than Calvinists
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.480]   is that Arminians have this kind of motive
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.480]   that if I don't work harder, then I might lose my salvation.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.800]   I'm not saying that sophisticated, historic Arminians
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   commend that kind of motivation,
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   but I was talking to a man last Sunday, Tony,
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.660]   at the church that we're visiting here in Knoxville,
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.220]   and he was telling me that that's one of the reasons
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.520]   he converted to a more Reformed vision
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.160]   is because that all his life growing up,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.600]   he was tormented by the fear of losing his salvation,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.320]   and it was taught that he could lose it,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.360]   and it had an effect on the way he went
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.840]   about doing his work.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   And so I don't want people to work like Arminians.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.160]   So, you know, when I hear the mantra,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.880]   work like an Arminian and sleep like a Calvin,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.580]   I say, no, I don't want people to work that way.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.760]   So it's a detraction, I think,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.720]   from the truth, the biblical truth of Calvinism
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   to say that there's a superior way of being motivated
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.920]   by something that's less biblical.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   So I think the ground of our work as Calvinists
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.160]   is far greater, more peaceful, more motivating
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.400]   than any other view provides.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   And here's the kind of text I have in mind.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.920]   First Corinthians 15, 10,
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.440]   by the grace of God, I am what I am,
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.540]   and his grace toward me was not in vain,
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.600]   but I worked harder than any of them,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.400]   yet it was not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   Now that's a precisely Calvinistic drivenness
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.600]   from a grace standpoint.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.320]   Grace came to Paul, it didn't come in vain, he said,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.720]   it produced the hardest work imaginable,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.920]   and then he pauses and says,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.640]   but that hard work was not me, it was God.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.600]   So it's the sovereignty of grace in my life,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.900]   empowering me, that produces the kind of work
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.920]   that gives God glory and gives me a sense of peace
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.940]   that I'm being carried along by grace,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.680]   even as I work very hard at it.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.960]   Or another one would be Philippians 2, 13,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.200]   work out your own salvation,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   because God is at work in you.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.280]   Or later Philippians 3, 12,
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.560]   I press on to make it my own,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.660]   because Christ has made me his own.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.520]   So both of those texts in Philippians,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.520]   in both of them, the stress falls on God's sovereign
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.340]   initiative producing our vigorous efforts.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.440]   And then there's Colossians 1, 29,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.040]   for this I toil, he's talking about producing maturity
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.160]   in believers, for this I toil,
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.520]   struggling with all the energy
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.920]   that he powerfully works within me.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.440]   So Paul's toil and his struggle
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.440]   are with the very power of God that is working in Paul.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.880]   That's the heart of Calvinism.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.640]   God is the sovereign initiative taker,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.200]   God is the sovereign worker and producer,
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.920]   God is the sovereign empower and enabler.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.640]   And so when it comes to human living and human working,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.600]   what we're doing is trusting, resting,
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   and being empowered by what God does
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.280]   so that God gets all the glory,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.520]   which is another hallmark of Calvinism.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   First Peter 4, 11, let him who serves,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.760]   or you could say let him who works,
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.800]   work in the strength that God supplies
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.120]   so that in everything God gets the glory.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.800]   So it's precisely working like a Calvinist
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.080]   that gets God glory.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.520]   So you can see how I get bent out of shape
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.320]   if I hear somebody say, don't work like a Calvinist.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.120]   What, working like a Calvinist is precisely
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.160]   the kind of work that is restful
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   and trusting and being carried.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.120]   My yoke is easy, my burden is light,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.520]   and then God, the great sovereign initiative taking,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.240]   sustaining God is getting all the glory.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.880]   Let me just say one last thing.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.720]   (laughs)
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.560]   This is long.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:55.280]   It's historically just plain false
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.120]   to imply that Calvinism, when it came into being
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.920]   in its more systematic refined form,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.500]   produced less work than others.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.560]   The Protestant work ethic was begotten
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.560]   by the reformed vision of reality
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.400]   and it built the modern world we know.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.440]   So my preference would be a slogan like,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.960]   work like a Calvinist, play like a Calvinist,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.800]   sleep like a Calvinist, outproduce, outplay,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.040]   outdream everyone by trusting in your sovereign God.
