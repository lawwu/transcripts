[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.720]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.320]   to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.640]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.760]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.120]   My name is Joshua Sheets, I'm your host.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.560]   And today I'm joined by my friend, Mikkel Thorup.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.800]   And we're here today to talk about internationalization
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.920]   and specifically the great nation of Panama
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.880]   as we prepare for our forthcoming Panama adventure
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.880]   in January.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.700]   Mikkel, welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.600]   - Joshua, I am super stoked to be here.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.880]   I think this is gonna be a fun conversation today
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.980]   and hopefully help your audience
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.160]   and inspire them a little bit
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440]   and hopefully meet them in January.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.240]   I think it's gonna be a great opportunity.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.080]   - I'm excited about it.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.560]   I've been wanting to host events
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.480]   as part of the Radical Personal Finance work for a while.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.040]   And with having a bazillion small children,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.640]   it's been difficult to do.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.000]   And so when we had the idea of,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.760]   hey, Mikkel will organize the details,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.320]   he'll organize the tour,
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   he does this kind of thing quite frequently,
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.200]   and I'll come and I'll bring my audience
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400]   and we'll hang out, I jumped on the chance.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.040]   - You do not just Panama,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.360]   you've been doing these kinds of investment tours
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.520]   all around the world, right?
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.840]   Tell us about that.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.680]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.120]   So we just got back from one in Uruguay last week or so,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.280]   and it was amazing.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.200]   We had 26 clients who came down with me.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.680]   We actually met here in Panama.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.160]   I took everybody out for dinner.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.280]   We flew down as a group, business class all the way,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.840]   had buses pick us up and take us out to the coastline.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.880]   And it was just an amazing experience.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.360]   The response has been fantastic.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.280]   Actually, we just put out a video about the Uruguay trip.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.800]   So if anybody's thinking about,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.320]   maybe what is the Panama trip gonna be like?
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.600]   This one we just did in Uruguay is a great example of that.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.800]   So maybe you might be able to share with people.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.520]   Now we do other trips to Brazil and Colombia
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   and other things like this.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.240]   We've got a lot of experience about it,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.960]   but Panama is my home base.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.520]   So this is the flagship trip, the flagship place.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.160]   It's really special, it's gonna be amazing.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.040]   - You've got all the people.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.480]   I think meeting in Panama is great.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.080]   One of the things that I love about Panama City,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.160]   I consider there to be basically two capitals
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.960]   of the Americas broadly.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.600]   One is Panama City, the other is Miami.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.560]   And then possibly we could come into something
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.640]   like Mexico City in terms of the impact that it has.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.320]   But Panama City has a great location for that
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.560]   and tremendous connectivity between South America,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.880]   Central America, North America, Europe, et cetera.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.440]   Why did you move to Panama?
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   'Cause you didn't begin there, you started in Canada.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.840]   Why did you move to Panama originally?
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.800]   - Ooh, okay, long, long story,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.320]   but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440]   So I've actually been living overseas for,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   I'm going on 24 years now.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.080]   So I've lived in nine different countries.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.000]   I was in the South Pacific for four years.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   I was in Asia for a while.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360]   I lived in the Middle East for just under a decade.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   I was in Abu Dhabi.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.960]   And originally, I've always been very attracted
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   to tax-free type of places.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.160]   And I needed to find another place
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.560]   when we decided to leave the Middle East
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.200]   that was gonna tick that box.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.640]   Now there were other reasons.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.360]   I wanted to homeschool my kids.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   I got a couple of kids on my own,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.960]   not as many as you do, Joshua, by the way, everybody.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.600]   I met Joshua's kids and his family in Panama
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.080]   a couple of months ago.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.760]   Amazing, your kids are brilliant.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   You've done such a fantastic job raising them
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.120]   and teaching them different languages and stuff.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.520]   I was super, super impressed with your family.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.200]   - Thank you very much. - It's truly amazing.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.560]   But I wanted more opportunity for my daughter at the time.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.400]   And I wanted to be away from some of the conflict zones
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.800]   and we can kind of get into the geopolitics
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   and what's going on in the world
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.240]   maybe a little bit later in our conversation.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.960]   But I could see what was going on in the Middle East
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.800]   and possible war with Iran and things like this.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I wanted to be in a more food-independent,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.880]   water-independent, energy-independent country.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.200]   So we started looking around
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.680]   and I needed it to also tick a couple of boxes,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.040]   like a good immigration plan and the taxation,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.840]   like I mentioned.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.360]   We had a short list of countries
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.840]   and we were looking at moving back to Singapore
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.000]   or to Thailand or different places like that.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.600]   But over and over and over again,
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.840]   Panama kept coming to the top of the pile.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.240]   Now my wife had never been there.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.320]   She had never experienced the country before.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   I had been to Panama 20 years previous
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080]   on a trip through the region.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.400]   And I really remember it speaking to me
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.840]   and having fond memories of it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.880]   So we took a chance and we came down here
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.000]   and we've loved it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.520]   We've been really stoked with our decision.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.720]   We've been here going on five years now,
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   which means actually next year,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.640]   I get to make the application for my citizenship.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920]   I was just in with the lawyers talking about it
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.760]   on Monday or Tuesday of this week, mapping it all out.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   So there is a path to citizenship for people.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.280]   We've got our life here.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.440]   We've bought real estate here.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.320]   We have friends here.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.760]   We learned the language.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.920]   It's just been a tremendous experience.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.880]   And I'm very, very happy with Panama.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.600]   And I'm super happy to share it with other people
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.200]   and show everyone what we figured out.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.120]   - Yeah.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.160]   When you compare, it sounds first of all,
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.720]   that one of the attractions for you was a city.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.000]   You mentioned a lot of cities along there.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.120]   Do you think that Panama is best suited
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.240]   for people who are attracted to the urban lifestyle
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.680]   or the kind of sitting on the beach
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.880]   kind of lifestyle as well?
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   - What an interesting question.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   So, okay, let's take even one step further back.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   First and foremost,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.640]   I believe that Panama is an excellent plan A.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   I think that it's a great place for people to live to,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.240]   to move to.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.720]   Now it does work really well as a plan B,
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.400]   and we can get into the details of this reason why.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.720]   But on top of that, Panama has it all.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.480]   Okay, we've got the Caribbean side.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.720]   We have the Pacific side.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.240]   We've got the mountains and we've got the city,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.800]   Panama City, like you mentioned before,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.040]   one of the hub of the Americas.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.840]   So it doesn't really matter
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.600]   what type of lifestyle you're after.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.440]   You can have any one of those things,
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.560]   or like me and my family do, we have a combination.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.080]   So we have the beach property, which is an hour's drive.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.680]   And I'd love to show your audience
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.080]   if they come on down on this trip,
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.320]   we're gonna take the drive out there.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.520]   We're gonna see the beach area.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.240]   We're gonna go and view real estate, rental properties
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.800]   for short-term, long-term, everything like that.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.280]   We're gonna be looking at stuff in the city.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.120]   I have a place in downtown Panama City.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.360]   I actually bought a new place in downtown Panama
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.760]   on a man-made island right here.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.080]   Just like if you guys think about the palms in Dubai,
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.760]   if you've ever seen those pictures,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.080]   we have two man-made islands off the coast of Panama City,
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.840]   like right there.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.600]   I just bought a new place there.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.200]   And we have a place in the mountain,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.040]   which is being built right now.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.120]   And that's maybe 90 minutes, 75 minutes drive
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.960]   from Panama City.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.200]   So you can see these things are really, really close.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   So even if you decide, you know what?
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.280]   I don't want the hot weather.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   I wanna be in the mountains.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.360]   I want cooler weather,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.800]   but I want access to all of the infrastructure.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.640]   Perfect.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.760]   Less than an hour and a half,
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.240]   and you're in downtown Panama City
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   with the best shopping, the best malls,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.320]   the best cinemas and restaurants and cafes
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   and everything like that.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.920]   And even if you didn't wanna drive so far,
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.960]   you can drive down the hill 15 minutes
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.520]   and be in a town that still has all your grocery stores
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.800]   and all those amenities.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.600]   So it's quite a compact place,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.920]   but it speaks to many different types of lifestyles.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.080]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.240]   And the thing that has impressed me a lot
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.280]   about Panama City specifically, where it's most visible,
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.040]   I think it applies broadly to the whole nation,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   but Panama has developed very, very quickly.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.360]   I mean, you said you were there 20 years ago
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.800]   versus when you moved there five years ago.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.160]   I've traveled a lot in Central America,
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.120]   South America, and you go one place,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.760]   some cities you go and you visit,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.960]   and then you come back 10, 15, 20 years later,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.240]   and it's exactly the same.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.880]   Panama City has not been that place.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.680]   It has completely transformed itself
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.800]   over the last few decades.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.720]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.720]   I mean, so in 2003, 2004, I took 18 months
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.040]   and I hitchhiked and backpacked through Latin America.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.320]   So I went to Belize and Guatemala and El Salvador
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.880]   and Nicaragua and Costa Rica and Honduras, Panama.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.080]   I mean, if we compare a couple of those countries,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.480]   like, okay, Costa Rica has gone up, it's growing,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.280]   but not a huge amount.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.960]   Belize has kind of stood still.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.640]   Belize is trapped in a time capsule
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.360]   from 20 years ago or more.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   But Panama is totally different.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.480]   They've done all these reclaimed land projects,
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.240]   like Avenida Balboa is reclaimed land.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.520]   They've done Santa Maria, which is by the mangroves,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.040]   huge development there.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.720]   We're doing the man-made islands that we just talked about.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.880]   Casco Viejo, which is like a world heritage site,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.400]   has had hundreds of millions of dollars rammed into it.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.600]   So it's restoration of all these buildings.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   It's like a living museum.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.520]   If you guys have gone to Cartagena before in Colombia,
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.000]   it's like Cartagena, but on a smaller scale.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.720]   It is right here in Panama, like a hub destination.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.720]   So it's cafes and rooftop bars,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.320]   and it's just, it's growing so much in the years.
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   And what does this mean for people like us?
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.000]   Well, it's a great opportunity to get in on a trend
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.680]   with any of the investment
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.400]   because rising tide lifts all boats.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.840]   This is new ferry terminal, cruise ship terminal,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   new convention center, Casco, which we mentioned.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.520]   All these types of things are huge infrastructure projects
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.000]   that raise all of the value.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.840]   - Yeah.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.080]   It seems to me, you mentioned the tax efficiency.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.480]   There are many people who that's very important,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.720]   and many people who it's unimportant to.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.480]   But one of my observations over the years
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.320]   is that in many cases, tax efficiency is one of those,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.640]   I don't know if it's a leading indicator,
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.000]   but it's certainly one of those things
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.160]   that goes along with a lot of development.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.440]   Because if a country knows, every government knows,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.320]   okay, we can pass whatever tax laws we want to,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.600]   whatever thing we can force the people to accept.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.160]   We could put 97% income tax rates.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.760]   We could put a two or three X value added tax
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.360]   or whatever we want on our products.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.800]   But when a country makes the intentional choice to say,
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.120]   we're going to tax very lightly and very thoughtfully,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.320]   they're doing that because as I see it,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.880]   they're rolling up their sleeves
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.600]   and going into the world of competition.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.800]   And they're inviting people to say,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.840]   hey, consider us as a destination.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.880]   And that's something that Panama has embraced
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   for many years.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.240]   It's very much part of the culture.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.360]   And so boat registrations, banking,
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840]   international business corporations, et cetera,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.200]   has all gone, a lot of businesses flowed there.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.640]   And in response, Panama, I think,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   has done a good job of seeking to develop it.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.360]   They've tried to build out the transit.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   The airport is nicely connected to the city with a train.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.000]   The airport itself serves well, the whole downtown.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.880]   And so I think people often have this misunderstanding,
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.640]   especially those coming from the high tax world,
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.120]   a misunderstanding that, well,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.320]   if you go to a place where taxes are light, nothing works.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.160]   That's not true.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.560]   We've seen it Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia, Panama,
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.480]   countries that know they have to compete,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.480]   they actually roll up their sleeves and start competing.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.320]   - A hundred percent.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.240]   I mean, and those countries that you've mentioned,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.360]   I've lived in all of them as well.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.960]   I've spent considerable amount of times in those,
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.840]   and I've seen what happens when they deregulate,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.080]   when they lower taxes, and when they're, as you said,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.280]   a lot more thoughtful with these types of things.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.960]   It's massive amounts of foreign direct investment.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.320]   You can build a life in these places,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.640]   and you can really participate in something
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.880]   that's exciting and new and fresh and lively.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.040]   And it's just amazing to watch the changes
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   and watch the grow.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.240]   And I'm addicted to that.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.680]   I love that feeling of growth, of expanding.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.440]   So I think it's really, really amazing.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.360]   So I think that Panama has all of those things,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.040]   except it's not like Singapore, which is kind of,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.280]   I wouldn't say done, but I mean, it's well-established.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.680]   Singapore is like super well-established.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.960]   You want to go in there.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.680]   It's a couple million dollars just to get started.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.160]   Panama's heading in that direction,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.200]   but your ticket to the ball is not a couple of million
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.440]   dollars, it's considerably less than that,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.040]   maybe a hundred thousand, couple hundred thousand dollars
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.120]   if you want to get the immigration here.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.520]   But I mean, there's so many options.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.640]   So it's like, don't wait for these things for five years
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.480]   or 10 years or something like that.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.840]   That you've missed the boat.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.320]   I mean, you need to identify what the trend is
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.080]   and then take a risk and put some time and energy
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120]   and effort into this place.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.520]   And this is what we're going to be doing.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.560]   This trip that we're doing together
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.600]   is going to be a massive opportunity for people
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.800]   to really get educated about this.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.440]   Not just for me, like, okay, I've been here for five years,
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.240]   but all of the lawyers that I work with,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.880]   the property developers, the banks, the service providers,
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.760]   all of these people, you're going to meet
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.280]   all of the network.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.560]   This is not a conference with 500 people there
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.880]   and you just listen to someone talk at you.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.480]   This is a small group, say 25 people, 30 people,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.960]   maximum, maximum.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.440]   So every day we get to share with you, me, the lawyers,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.560]   get your questions answered.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   It's a shortcut.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.880]   I think that's the best way to put it.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.520]   It's a shortcut on all of this type of stuff.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.320]   - And there is still, even though we have so much access
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.600]   to good media, there's no substitute for going somewhere
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   and seeing it and being in a place.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.200]   That's what I've been doing very intensively
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.600]   over the last few years is systematically going
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.160]   and I take my children with me,
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   but going to places and seeing things
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.800]   because once you are actually in a place,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   you can very quickly judge for yourself
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.320]   whether the information that you read online
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.800]   or the information you were given yourself is right.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.040]   When I was with you in Panama City,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.200]   immediately after touring Panama City with my family,
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.000]   we flew directly to Mexico, sorry, to Cuba.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.280]   And it was an important trip for me
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.360]   because I had spent from 2005,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.720]   when I had a bunch of left-wing,
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.400]   I had a professor of mine that was very influential
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.600]   and he was this hardcore leftist,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.800]   very much a hardcore leftist,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.520]   a liberation theologian and whatnot.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.040]   And he praised to the mountaintops,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.480]   Venezuela and Cuba at this point in time
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.360]   as like being the paragon of development
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.720]   and human rights, et cetera.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, I've watched and have a good amount of experience
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.520]   with Venezuela, but I had not ever been able to get to Cuba.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   And so finally I went and took my family to Cuba
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.480]   and we spent a week there.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.680]   And you just get off the airplane and you go into the town
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.480]   and you can immediately feel in about 60 minutes
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.560]   the truth or in this case, the absolute non-truth
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.120]   of what that particular professor was sharing.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.960]   And it made me sad.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.800]   It was not a fun trip.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.920]   I didn't, it was a very difficult trip,
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.720]   but it was a very poignant example of how important it is
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.280]   to get your boots on the ground and feel the place.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.960]   I wanna go back because these terms,
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.440]   plan A, plan B, et cetera,
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.560]   are probably really comfortable to those of us
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.440]   who spend a lot of time thinking about internationalization
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.760]   and plans and going around the world.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.680]   But I don't think they're very normal terms
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.520]   among a lot of people.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.240]   How do you define the term of plan A and plan B?
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.440]   And why is that definition important
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.240]   in internationalization?
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.360]   - 100%, we need to make sure that everybody understands
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.720]   the lexicon and what we're talking about here.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.560]   So let's actually do it in reverse order.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.160]   A plan B would be someone who's listening to this,
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.360]   you're in the United States, you're in Canada,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.600]   you're in Australia or New Zealand
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.200]   or wherever you guys are.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.080]   And you like your life there, okay?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.400]   You have a nice job or you got your business,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.600]   you got your family,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   you hang out with your friends from college.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.240]   Amazing, that's fantastic.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.360]   But at the same time,
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.920]   you're kind of looking around at the world
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   and you're going, there's some worrying things going on.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.160]   There's wars, there were lockdowns,
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.160]   there's a whole bunch of stuff that maybe you agree with
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   or don't agree with, but you can understand that
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.000]   these are, how to say this politely,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.840]   these are troubling times, let's just put it that way.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.280]   You can identify this.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.400]   Now, have you talked to your spouse about it?
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.920]   Have you talked to your friends about it?
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.880]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.440]   But I think you probably recognize
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.680]   that there's something weird going on in the world.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.680]   And you as an individual or a sibling or a parent
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.200]   or whatever, you have a responsibility
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.520]   to you and your family.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.200]   Part of that responsibility is, okay,
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.320]   yes, having enough water and food in the house
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.720]   in case there is a hurricane
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.640]   if you live in that type of a belt.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.640]   But another type of plan B or backup is a political one.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.440]   What happens if things happen in your country?
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.880]   Where are you going to go?
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.160]   You can't just get on an airplane
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.360]   and go to another country without a residency there.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.400]   I mean, you can under a tourist visa,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.680]   you could spend 30 days there,
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.400]   you could spend 60 days there, maybe 90,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.880]   but at some point they're gonna kick you out.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.160]   You're gonna be overstaying your visa.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.480]   You'll be illegal in the country.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.320]   You don't have a legal right to live there or work there.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.200]   You might not even have a legal right to purchase property.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.560]   So what do you do?
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.680]   Well, we need to set those things up in advance.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.040]   And that's what we affectionately call a plan B.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   And inside of that plan B ecosphere is the banking,
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   the corporate structures, the immigration,
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.200]   the tax planning, and the investment.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.440]   Traditionally, or at least from my standpoint,
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.240]   the investment side is real estate,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.480]   making sure you have something tangible
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.760]   that will be very difficult
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.800]   for someone to take away from you.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.400]   So that's kind of the idea of a plan B
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.680]   and where it comes from.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.400]   It's political insurance or insurance on yourself
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.880]   for moving to another country.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.080]   Now, a plan A, you would think,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.320]   "Okay, well, if I move to Panama, I've got my plan B."
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.280]   No, Panama has now turned from your plan B
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.160]   into your plan A because it's your primary destination.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.920]   It's where you actually live now.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.360]   It's where your kids go to school and all these things.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.440]   So now we might wanna set up something on top of that.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.760]   Now it might not have to be as many things.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.000]   Like I have plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, plan A.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.960]   Like I have real estate in eight different countries.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   So I'm not saying you need to be as crazy as I am
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.800]   with all of these things.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.000]   I tested out, I'm a Guinea pig and things.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.040]   But I think at the very minimum,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.640]   we need to have a hard look at what your plan A is
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.200]   and be setting up a plan B, full stop.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.600]   - Yeah, when I think about it,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   I just think what occurs to me,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.120]   and I do think it works better to start
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.480]   with kind of plan B versus plan A.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.000]   Because if people think,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.080]   "Well, in order for me to engage in flag planting,"
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.200]   meaning work with different countries
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   and do something outside of my own country,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.880]   I have to move there.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.760]   That's just not, that's not the world we live in anymore.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.000]   And it's not even the wisest course of action.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.520]   Moving and living somewhere full-time 365 days a year
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.160]   can be extremely disruptive to your life.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.680]   But you don't have to move to a place
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.600]   to start putting down some connections there.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.800]   So I would compare it,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.520]   let's say someone is living in the United States
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.160]   and they're thinking about moving to another state
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.800]   or another city in another state.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.920]   Normally they'll start by going to that place and visiting,
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.320]   and they'll go and take a vacation,
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320]   spend a week or two there, and they realize,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.840]   you know what, really like the feeling of being here.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.040]   Then they'll dig a little bit deeper,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.000]   they look at the economy,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   look at what job options are available,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.760]   and they might want to start making some connections,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.040]   networking with some people,
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.600]   going and attending a local church,
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.840]   a local business organization,
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.240]   seeing what the opportunities are in that area.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.200]   Now, when you do that within a country,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.520]   pretty much the day you decide to move,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.040]   you can deal with all the legal stuff later.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.560]   Your bank account works just the same
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.920]   whether you're living in Florida or in Tennessee.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.640]   Your driver's license is just a matter
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.920]   of reaching out to the state government and saying,
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.880]   "Hey, can I have this?"
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.800]   And you have the legal right to live in a country.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.160]   When you're going international,
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.920]   it's not that much more difficult,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.600]   but there are a few more points.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   You have to get the right to live there.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.680]   You have to sometimes step through some hurdles
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.080]   to set up local infrastructure.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.480]   You may need a tax ID number
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.240]   in order to activate your local utilities
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.400]   or open a local bank account, et cetera.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.880]   And so my preferred approach is to say,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.040]   "Where are some places that I'm interested in?"
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.960]   And then choose to set up plans, plan B of,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.200]   "Hey, if I ever needed it,
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.160]   I could go and live in this country."
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.640]   So I have a couple of complete,
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.680]   basically I think of them as packages of,
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.360]   here is a country where I have a complete local plan B.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.680]   I have a residency card
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.200]   that gives me the permission to live there.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.440]   I have a driver's license
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.040]   that gives me the ability to travel there and drive there.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.000]   I have a bank account.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.200]   I have everything set up.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.760]   I have a phone number that's with that.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.160]   So I have everything set up for my identity there.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.400]   And if I wanted to move there,
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.360]   I can just simply get on an airplane and go.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.760]   And from day one, I'm ready to go
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.400]   because everything is established for me.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.200]   And that does solve, just having that,
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.040]   even if you don't move,
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.360]   it solves some of those big picture ideas.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.720]   In many difficult situations,
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.040]   your best bet is to be prepared to stay at home
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.520]   or relocate locally.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.280]   But there are a lot of national level issues.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.880]   Political issues are an enormous risk.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.520]   Various economic issues that affect the entire country.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.040]   Issues such as national legislation,
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.400]   we saw during the pandemic,
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.400]   the country you lived in
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.960]   made a big difference in your experience.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.760]   And so being prepared to have another country
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.840]   that you can go to,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.520]   solves very elegantly some of those extreme situations
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.160]   that really nothing else does.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.240]   But you don't have to move to a place.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.800]   Moving to a place is your plan A.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.000]   And that's where you say,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.040]   I really wanna build my life here
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.360]   because of the opportunities that are gonna be there
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.840]   or how my lifestyle is gonna be superior.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.880]   And people can pick and choose as they like.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.840]   And for most of us,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.080]   I think we start off down a road of,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.760]   let me try it here.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.040]   Let me try opening a bank account.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.720]   I remember the first time I opened a bank account abroad,
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.680]   I felt like a criminal.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.880]   I felt like a terrorist or something
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.360]   trying to do something like crazy and sneaky.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.040]   And then I put my money in there
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.960]   and I had my debit card and I started using it.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.160]   And I realized, why was that such a big deal?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.000]   But I only realized it wasn't a big deal
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.960]   when I actually did it.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.800]   - For sure.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.920]   And I think that there's a lot of emotional stuff
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.760]   that's going on in the world right now.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.240]   And for a lot of people,
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.120]   there might feel stress or anxiety,
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.000]   watching mainstream media and seeing what's happening.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.600]   With a lot of the clients that I work with,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.120]   once we set up this plan B, as you said,
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.600]   the immigration, the banking, the structuring,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.000]   actually a lot of that stress and anxiety starts to go away
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.560]   because they realize that they're actually
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.520]   a lot more prepared than anybody else around them.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.280]   So just that mental feeling that things are gonna be okay,
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.720]   I think that's worth its weight in gold as well.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.560]   - Absolutely.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.960]   I struggle with whether I'll move back
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.680]   to the United States in the future.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.160]   And I'm much more open to it than I ever was in the past.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.760]   But what I realized is that in order for me
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.040]   to feel comfortable with the idea
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.440]   of living in the United States,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.240]   I had to leave and know that I don't have to live there.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.400]   And now I can look at it and say, you know what?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.800]   That country has many good things about it.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.240]   But the peace that came with knowing
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.640]   I could divorce that country
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.200]   and never deal with those bozos again in my life,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.800]   I would happily repay all of the money
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.480]   and all of the time and all of the energy that it put in.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.120]   I'd do it twice over just to regain that sense of peace.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.160]   - It's optionality.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.400]   It gives you options.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.840]   This type of lifestyle, learning about these things,
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.680]   getting educated about it, it gives you options.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.400]   And with options, you're a lot more resilient.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.240]   And I think with the resiliency,
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.360]   you're gonna feel a lot better.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.880]   So I think it's well worth coming
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   and at least learning about the stuff,
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.280]   getting educated about it.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.120]   - Absolutely.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.160]   During this event that we're holding,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.240]   we're gonna do in-depth seminars on a lot of subjects.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.960]   We're gonna, and we're gonna tour
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.280]   a lot of different aspects of Panama.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.480]   But I'd like to talk just about some of those areas
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.440]   where Panama really shines.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.040]   What are some of the ways that Panama can be useful,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.080]   even for those who aren't fully relocating
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.520]   and living in Panama City as your neighbor?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.240]   - Perfect.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.960]   So let's talk first about the taxation,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.360]   just so you guys have a little bit of an understanding
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.040]   of how the tax works here.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.440]   So Panama is what's called a territorial tax system,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.440]   which means that Panama is not taxing you on income,
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.080]   which is generated outside of the country.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   So if you have a coaching business or consulting
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.360]   or Amazon FBA or drop shipping,
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.280]   or you work for a company and you travel
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.000]   or any of these things like that,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.640]   you bring the money into Panama,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.520]   they're not gonna tax you on any of that.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.720]   Now, if you cut hair for a living
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.840]   and you wanna cut hair in here in Panama,
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.920]   okay, that's locally sourced income,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.360]   and you will definitely need to pay tax on that.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.040]   But any of the foreign sourced income,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   there's no tax on it.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.040]   Now, if you're a US person,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.680]   well, we need to talk about that piece of the puzzle,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.200]   but that is also ways to navigate that legally.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.480]   And there's some programs by the IRS
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.080]   to make sure that you pay as little as possible.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.640]   We'll cover all of those in the program.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.600]   But back to Panama.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.840]   The other amazing thing here in Panama
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.680]   is the residency programs here.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.240]   So the residency is your legal right
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.640]   to live and work in another country.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.840]   Now, there's different,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.960]   every country has their different programs
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.680]   and different timelines and costs to get involved.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.520]   One of the really nice things about Panama
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.120]   is once you get approved for your residency,
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.960]   to keep it active,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.520]   you have to visit the country one day every two years.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.720]   That's it.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.880]   So you fly down from the States or from Canada or whatever,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.400]   it's a few hour flight.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.040]   You come down, you have dinner,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.280]   you go to the beach for a day or a week
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.920]   or whatever you want, and you leave.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.840]   If you can do that every two years,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.960]   two years, you will keep it active.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.640]   There's other programs where you have to spend
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.520]   183 days in a country,
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.080]   which means you become a tax resident,
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.680]   which means now you have additional tax obligations.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.520]   There's some countries where you have to spend
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.120]   almost every single day in a calendar year
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.080]   to keep your residency active.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.440]   There's ones that have time limits on them.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.480]   They're a two-year residency or a five-year residency.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.080]   This is a permanent residency.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.160]   You can have it for the rest of your life
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.600]   and you only need to spend one day every two years.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.040]   In the world of Plan Bs, this is excellent.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.560]   This is like incredibly good.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.960]   Then there's a lot of the reasons that we already discussed,
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.040]   the economic trends that are happening in Panama,
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.520]   massive amounts of foreign direct investment,
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.080]   infrastructure projects.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.520]   You mentioned also the subways.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.800]   They're putting in new subways and train lines.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.720]   They're putting in new highways, all of this.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.360]   There's a lot of big projects from the banking side.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.160]   I mean, we have one of the largest banking sectors
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.080]   in the world here.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.760]   I think it's 93 international banks.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.720]   It's mostly down on Calle Cinquenta,
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.520]   basically Road 50.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.960]   There's lots and lots of options from the banking side.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.760]   Then there's lots of reasons I think that Panama hits this.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.200]   Then, okay, the last one and the obvious one,
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.480]   and I leave it for last, kind of funny,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.480]   is the Panama Canal.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.200]   I mean, this brings in billions upon billions
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.800]   upon billions of dollars into this country.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.920]   It's now administered by the Panamanians.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.320]   It's an engineering marvel.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.920]   It's incredible to go and watch.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.560]   Actually, I'm going to take our group down, Joshua,
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.480]   to see it because I think it's such an economic driver
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.200]   that people have to see it on the trip to really understand.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.280]   But it adds so much stability to the country.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.440]   There's so much product that's coming in here.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.160]   They've created free trade zones
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   and special economic zones based around this.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.280]   So Panama's an important player in the world.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.160]   And with being so well-connected
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.400]   and so easy access to the states,
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.040]   I mean, it just ticks a lot of the boxes.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.560]   - Yeah.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.360]   Don't underestimate the importance, anybody,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.680]   of the connection of easy access.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.520]   Most of my audience is in North America and in Europe
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.560]   because most of my content is,
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.840]   virtually all of this content is in English language.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.960]   And that's where the dominant
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.000]   English language approaches are.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.760]   When I first started internationalizing,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.560]   I thought, well, I'm willing to go wherever it takes.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.200]   I'll do whatever it takes.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.040]   I like to travel.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.200]   I like to get on airplanes.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   Well, at this point, buying seven airplane tickets
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.520]   and traveling from Miami to Singapore,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.960]   I love that travel,
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.200]   but it's not so easy with young children.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.240]   The numbers add up quickly.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.160]   It's not the kind of thing that you can just say,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.600]   well, let's just go to Singapore this weekend
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.800]   and meet with my banker.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.600]   Panama, on the other hand, has incredible connectivity.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.880]   I mean, for me, being from Florida, I'm spoiled.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.840]   You've got all the low-cost airlines that fly there
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.120]   and basically 200 bucks round trip and you're there.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:42.400]   Even for many other parts of the United States,
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.640]   it's relatively inexpensive to get to, it's short flights.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.320]   The time zones are incredibly convenient
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.080]   being on Eastern time zone.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.760]   And even just the US dollar parity,
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.720]   Panama has its own currency, but it's pegged to the US dollar.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.600]   And so that brings a stability to the financial supply
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.720]   and the currency.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   It's really nice.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.640]   And one of my favorite things actually about Panama City,
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.760]   which even the canal zone,
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.040]   it is probably one of the more welcoming
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.560]   kind of familiar feeling places in Latin America.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.160]   I love the Spanish colonial architecture.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.320]   I love visiting different places that feel very unlike
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.200]   where I'm from in the United States.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.240]   But there's no question that going to Panama,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.160]   because of the heavy influence of the Americans for so long,
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.560]   it just feels very welcoming and very friendly
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.960]   and feels very familiar in terms of how the infrastructure
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.800]   is set up.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.160]   So it's a really great scenario.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.960]   - We're going to talk in more,
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.280]   I think Panama, one of the unique benefits though,
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.880]   is Panama, even for non-residents is useful.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.920]   You mentioned banking, people all around the world
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.560]   use Panama for banking,
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.680]   but Panama is enormous in terms of foreign incorporation,
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.160]   as well as trusts and foundations as well.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.040]   Mention a few more things about those,
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.720]   even in the usefulness of that,
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.640]   even for people who don't live in Panama.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.280]   - Sure, so Panama is a civil law country.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.040]   So what that means is you can basically think of
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.600]   a common law country comes from the UK,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.640]   civil law is Roman law or European law.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.960]   Because of Latin America is pretty much all colonized
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.040]   by Europe, by Spain and Portugal and things like this,
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.160]   it's all civil law countries.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.680]   So what we have is the foundation down here.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.000]   Now, this is an excellent way that you can organize
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.880]   your assets, organize your financial life,
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.240]   especially if you want to invest in other countries,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.240]   real estate or banking or precious metals
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.680]   or stock accounts offshore,
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.200]   those can all be done through these type of vehicles.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.240]   And you rightly said, Joshua,
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.200]   Panama is one of the largest incorporation destinations.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.800]   So it's one of the largest offshore jurisdictions.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.920]   Now, okay, Hong Kong is very big as well,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.480]   but Hong Kong has come into problems
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.640]   over the last five or six years.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.240]   There's some other countries in the Caribbean,
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.080]   which are big ones as well,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.560]   but they don't have the larger economy to back them up.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.760]   They don't have the population.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.800]   They don't have the human capital in a lot of those places.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.480]   Panama is what I would call,
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.080]   and I don't mean this as an insult to anybody,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.800]   but Panama is a real country.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.120]   This is not a tiny little Caribbean speck
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.480]   with like 40,000 population for the entire country.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.760]   Panama is a real country.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.880]   I mean, there's a lot going on here.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.560]   So even if you decide, you know what?
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.360]   Okay, forget about, I don't want to live here.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.480]   Okay, I don't even want to get residency here.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.080]   There's still things here in Panama that speak to people
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.320]   who decide or who understand
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.760]   that they need to have a portion of their assets overseas.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.080]   They can't have all their eggs in one basket.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.840]   They can't just have a stock portfolio at Schwab
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.680]   and then think that that's diversified.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.360]   They realize that there needs to be differences
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.720]   in asset class, different in structures,
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.760]   difference in currencies and different programs.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.160]   Like we can open multi-currency accounts here.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.800]   You can have access to Swiss francs
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.080]   and different things like this.
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   So it's just perfectly geared towards this type of lifestyle.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.960]   And then, as you mentioned,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.720]   you don't need to fly for 18 hours to get to the place
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.360]   or take four connections to get there.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.600]   Like I lived in Abu Dhabi in Dubai for almost a decade.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.560]   I loved it over there.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.440]   It was fantastic, but it is a complete pain in the butt
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   to be eight hours, 10 hours time difference
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.920]   from all of my clients and my friends and family
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.200]   and everything like that.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   And 13 and a half hours flight to New York
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.400]   or 12 and a half hours flight to New York.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.320]   That's a long way.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.880]   But if you can come down here in three, four hours,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.240]   I mean, you come down in the morning
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.840]   and we'll go out for lunch in the afternoon.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.680]   It's perfect.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.760]   I mean, there's no jet lag.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.280]   You're basically on Eastern Standard Time or Central Time
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.120]   the entire year.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.000]   Panama doesn't change, the US and Canada change
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.520]   with daylight savings and stuff.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.840]   But you can go North-South really easy.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.720]   East-West becomes very challenging.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.840]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.440]   So you've been doing these investment tours.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.480]   I think it best if you just walk through the itinerary
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.600]   quickly, 'cause this is something you've done multiple times
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.160]   you've ironed out a lot of the wrinkles and the troubles
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.680]   and you've learned from doing these tours,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.280]   these one week tours in Panama and Uruguay
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.400]   and Eastern Europe and the Channel Islands, et cetera.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.520]   You've learned what really works.
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.160]   So go ahead and walk us through the itinerary
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.600]   of what we'll be doing during our time in Panama in January.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.440]   - Perfect.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.240]   So yes, we've got a lot of experience with these things.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.280]   What I have found works really well and is really special
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.920]   is to keep the group small.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.440]   This is the number one thing.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.920]   This is not a conference where it's like nine hours a day
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.480]   of someone talking at you the whole time
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.440]   and you're just in the receiving end of information.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.840]   No, everything is together.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.960]   Everybody is together every moment.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.480]   So we're sharing our meals together.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.080]   We do breakfast together in the mornings.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.680]   It's kind of a free flow when you get up
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.280]   but everybody's always sitting together.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.840]   Then we do conference material for two to three hours
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.160]   in the morning with a nice long break in between.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.920]   Now, this is not a rehearsed presentation
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.240]   that I've done a hundred times
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.480]   and I'm gonna hit every correct word on this step
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.320]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.440]   No, I mean, I do my presentations.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.280]   You have a question, you put your hand up
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.000]   or you interrupt me, I don't care.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.120]   And we deal with that issue in real time.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.440]   So it's more of a conversation back and forth.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.160]   Now, if you're really curious about the immigration
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.680]   on this particular piece, then perfect.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.960]   We'll dig into that.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.320]   The important point is that you get your questions answered.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.760]   Now, after we do a couple of hours
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.000]   of conference material in the morning,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.680]   we take a nice leisurely lunch.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.760]   We all sit together, we relax
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.640]   and then we go and do a field trip.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.600]   So some examples of the field trip
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.320]   that we'll be doing in January
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.600]   is I'm gonna take you guys out
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.080]   to the private man-made islands.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.160]   That's gonna be one.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.080]   We're gonna do a real estate tour.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.040]   That's another.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.880]   We're gonna go out to my friend's gold vault,
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.960]   a gold depository here.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.760]   I've known these guys for years and years.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.400]   They give us special permission
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.680]   to actually go inside the vault.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.200]   These are things that hold, you know,
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.320]   two, $300 million worth of precious metals.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.280]   You won't even find the place on a map.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.080]   It's super highly protected,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.720]   but we have special permission
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.640]   for everybody to go and view it.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.800]   We're gonna take you one day,
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.760]   we're gonna go out to the beach area.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.600]   We'll spend some time out there.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.960]   So you get to relax on the beach,
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.920]   see the coastline.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.880]   We'll have a bit of a party, some food.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.120]   You'll see some of the real estate options there.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.600]   We're gonna go out to a self-sustaining community,
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.160]   a gated community that I'm building
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.480]   with a business partner.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.880]   It's out in the mountains.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.000]   So you see the city, the beach, the mountains.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.760]   We're gonna go out to the Panama Canal, as I mentioned.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.520]   So these are all the different field trips
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.080]   that we'll be doing for the week.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.880]   And then at night, everybody gets together for dinner.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.240]   These are real restaurants.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.800]   This is not, "Hey, we're gonna serve you
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   some buffet slop type of things."
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.560]   This is like, "We're going out for steak dinners.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.280]   We're gonna drink a nice bottle of red wine,
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.000]   and we're gonna brainstorm
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.760]   and make connections with one another.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.440]   I'll be there, you'll be there.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.200]   Our friend Gabriel's gonna be there."
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.680]   So we'll take different times
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   and we'll sit with different people each night.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.760]   And then you're gonna get to meet other people on the tour.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.960]   So learn about their lives, what they're doing,
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.320]   what their businesses are.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.800]   Network and make connections with all of them.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.600]   And we're going for a week.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.640]   So the relationships, Joshua, this is what it's about.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.240]   Education, okay, awesome, great.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.120]   But the relationships, you can't replace that.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.000]   You can't get that in any other type of format.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.720]   But in this, it's center stage.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.200]   It's at the center of everything
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.680]   that we're doing with the trip.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.800]   And the success we have with these trips,
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.280]   the response we get is phenomenal.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.280]   People go crazy for these trips.
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.440]   And as I mentioned, we just published a new video
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.640]   from our trip last week.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.880]   You guys gotta see this.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.000]   You see this, you go, "Okay, I get it now.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.400]   I get what Mikel is talking about."
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.920]   But it's a tremendous experience.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.360]   - I'll make sure to share that on all of my profiles.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.720]   Dates of this event are January 22 to January 28.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.240]   And that'll be January 20 of the year 2024.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.320]   So January 22 to 28 of the year 2024.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.040]   It'll be a one week event, a beautiful time of year.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.120]   I gotta admit, we did pick it intentionally
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.000]   when it's cold and snowy.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.280]   You wanna come for a tropical vacation
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.840]   and enjoy some time in the sun.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.800]   But I'll be there, Gabriel will be there,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.240]   and Mikel will be there.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.440]   And I'm making myself fully available.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.120]   I'm not gonna bring my wife and children.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.960]   I'll be full.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.360]   So for me, I'm gonna be on vacation.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.560]   She's got the hard work at home.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.120]   I'm gonna be hanging out on the beach,
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.160]   chilling with you guys till midnight,
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.880]   talking about everything under the sun.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.360]   Mikel brings an enormous experience,
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.680]   a level of personal experience to this discussion
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.760]   and professional experience.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.400]   He's done this, he consults with people.

[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.440]   that I should have asked you about?
