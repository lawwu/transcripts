[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   How much of the parenting guidance out there do you think is misleading or just completely wrong?
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.240]   A huge share of the guidance is misleading in its strength, is how I would put it. So a lot
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.920]   of the advice comes with a, "If you don't do this, terrible outcome X will happen."
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.920]   You know, "If you don't breastfeed, your child will be a loser. If you co-sleep,
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.360]   your child will die. If you don't co-sleep, your child will never love you."
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.560]   Like the thing that's on the other end of it is a kind of devastating outcome in some way.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:44.560]   And the reality is very few of our parenting choices have any impact anywhere near that
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.000]   important. Maybe that isn't very nice to hear, but for the most part, many of the choices we make
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.800]   aren't really going to matter very much in the end based on the data.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.400]   So the difference between breastfeeding and not, the difference between circumcision and not,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.040]   there are maybe small things in any direction, but they're not that important. So I think that's
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.760]   the sense in which a lot of what we're hearing, a lot of the noise that parents hear is really
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.680]   misleading because it makes you think there is a correct way. And if I do the wrong way,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.080]   something terrible will happen. And most of the time, there isn't a particularly correct way.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.440]   And any choice you make is unlikely to matter that much in the long run.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.080]   And you mentioned look at the data. I know you have a background in economics,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.600]   which maybe is different than the average person talking about parenting advice. I'm curious how
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.800]   people can think about that job that they might have and not know, which is actually to look at
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.080]   the data instead of rely on one person's anecdotal advice or their experience, where maybe they've
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   only had that experience one time. As humans, we are very drawn to anecdotal experience. We really
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.280]   like stories and we find stories very compelling. And one of the things I've found in all of these
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.520]   years of using data is that I really believe in data. And that's my core. I've trained as an
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   economist. My economics work is very situated in data. I love it. And if you tell me, "Here's a
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.480]   piece of data. Here's a great randomized trial. And here's what you learned from it," I find that
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.320]   very compelling. One of the things I've learned over time is that not everyone finds data as
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.920]   compelling as I do. And there is sometimes a lot of value in helping people understand why data is
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:44.480]   just a lot of anecdotes altogether. When we think about how we can better incorporate the use of
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:55.360]   data in decisions, one key is to make sure you are asking the question in a thoughtful way that
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.160]   is seeking an answer. My sense is part of the reason why anecdote and other people's experiences,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.880]   whether they're strangers on the internet or people you see at the park or your family or
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.840]   whatever, the reason those things hit so hard is because they are pushed at you.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.280]   You're on Instagram and all of a sudden somebody's telling you something really that they think is
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   very important for you to do with your baby or you're doing something with your baby and your
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.040]   mother says, "Oh my God, that's so wrong. How could you possibly do that?" Or, "I did it differently
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.320]   and look how great you turned out." When we're looking to make decisions, we want to think about
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.000]   the decision and seek out help making the decision rather than making our decisions in the moment
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.320]   that someone is coming at us with an anecdote. You have a framework to think about this when
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.880]   you're making a decision. Is that right? In my book, The Family Farm, I talk about the idea of
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.480]   a decision framework, which I think is helpful for bigger decisions in particular. That starts
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.200]   with this idea of framing a question, of asking, "What am I trying to decide between? What are
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.600]   really the realistic choices?" Then it goes on to spend some time collecting all the data that
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.560]   you need, collecting all the information, the logistics, whatever is going into that decision.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.720]   Then you want to make the decision and move on. I think one of our big decision-making
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.080]   problems is that we tend to linger on our decisions and make them again and again and again
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.960]   without just accepting, "I'm going to make the decision and move forward."
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.840]   One of the challenges I've always had is sometimes you collect lots of data, and it doesn't just
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.560]   point you to the answer. Can you give an example first of how you might frame the question
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   better so that it makes it easier to look at that data and make a decision?
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.400]   First of all, I should say data is almost never going to give you an answer. If you're expecting
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.600]   the data to boss you to an answer, you will be disappointed almost every single time because
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.160]   there's very few things in life or in parenting where it's somehow so obvious from the evidence
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.520]   that one thing is the right thing. I'll give you a specific example, which is the decision
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.120]   of, "Should I send my child to daycare or should I have a nanny?" That's a question where I would
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.760]   encourage people to first think about what the realistic options are. "Should I send my child
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.800]   to daycare or not?" "Or not" is not a childcare solution. What is the other thing you could be
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.640]   doing? Is it you stay home? Is it a nanny? Is it a grandparent? Is it a different daycare? What are
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.720]   the actual choices? Then you get some data. In that case, for most people, the information that
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.400]   they would need would be both some information about what do we know about outcomes for daycare
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.520]   versus nanny versus stay-at-home parent. That's the kind of data I talk about in my books.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   Then there's also a bunch of information about your family, which also has to go into that
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.680]   decision. How much do these things cost? What other things would you have to give up if you
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.320]   wanted to pay for a more expensive option? What's realistic in terms of your careers?
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   What do you want? How do you want to spend your day? These are all quite important choices,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.040]   important parts of the decision that go along with the data. Then when you make that decision,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.880]   you take that data, but you overlay your preferences, your values, your constraints
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.040]   on top of it. That's how good decision-making happens. Do you think a lot of the decisions
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.800]   people treat as irreversible? I'm curious if they actually are. In business, we often talk about
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.320]   reversible and irreversible decisions and like, "Just make the decision and you can change it
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.960]   later." I'm curious how much that applies here. The last part of the decision-making framework I
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.560]   talk about is the idea of follow-up, that most of our decisions are not irreversible or at least
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:47.440]   not irreversible forever. A decision like, "I'm going to decide to send my child to daycare,"
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.360]   that's a decision you can revisit in a year or six months or some other time.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.560]   Humans don't like to revisit our decisions very much because it's like admitting we were wrong.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:03.680]   This is, I think, what happens in many cases, both in business and in parenting and in life,
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:12.000]   is I made this choice. I chose to send my child to this childcare option. Even if it's not working,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.400]   admitting that it's not working requires me to say I made a mistake. That's hard. The cognitive
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.120]   dissonance associated with having made a mistake is very hard, so people fail to revisit their
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.160]   choices. Sometimes you can get around that, like your psychology there, by planning to revisit.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.760]   In six months, we'll come back and ask if it worked. That's an opportunity to then frame
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.200]   a different choice, a reversal of the decision as like, "Well, this was an experiment,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.400]   and we knew we were going to revisit it as opposed to we made a mistake."
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   There are some decisions which are irreversible. If you choose not to breastfeed at some point,
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.720]   you won't be able to restart. There's some biology, things like that. A lot of the choices
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:01.600]   we make are reversible. Yeah. One investing principle I'll encourage people to also consider
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.960]   is thinking about the information you had when you made the decision. If you're deciding one
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.680]   year into daycare that you don't want to do it anymore, well, you have this new piece of
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.040]   information, which is one year of experience doing it. You're not saying your old decision
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.800]   was wrong. With the information you had a year ago, it might have been the right decision,
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.520]   and new information now lets you make a different decision that shouldn't make you feel like you
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.320]   did the wrong thing when you had the limited knowledge you did a year ago.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.960]   Totally. One of my favorite places where this comes up is in extracurriculars. When your kids
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.040]   get a little older than yours are, but there becomes this pressure to engage in very extensive
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.840]   extracurriculars, which take all of your weekends. There's this story about sitting in -- a friend of
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.680]   mine was sitting and watching their kid do some kind of gymnastics or something, and the parents
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.920]   behind them were like, "Boy, we hate doing this. It's such a waste. The kid hates it. We hate it,
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.560]   but what are you going to do about it?" The answer is like, "Well, quit. You're going to quit."
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.680]   But it's so hard to quit. We put all this time in and some combination of remembering like,
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.600]   "Look, now you've learned. Everyone hates gymnastics. You couldn't have known before,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.920]   but you learned you hate it, and now you should quit." Some combination of that and just the idea
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   of sunk costs are sunk. It's too bad you spent six years of your life investing in gymnastics,
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:34.000]   but don't make it worse by spending a seven. Yes, totally. I feel like nowadays -- and maybe
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.560]   this has always been the case, but I'm biased -- there's just so much pressure to try to raise
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.800]   the perfect child, be the perfect parent. I see lots of parents with anxiety about this and stress
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:53.280]   about this. What can people do? Because it seems like you said very beginning at the outset,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.720]   very few things are going to have this massive impact, yet I think a lot of parents carry
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.840]   a tremendous amount of burden and stress about trying to make sure their kid has every opportunity,
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.760]   gets the perfect school, gets the perfect this. The first thing I would say is that we might want
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.320]   to ask the question of why is this? What is the demographic change that caused this generation
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:27.120]   of parents to have more of this attitude than when I was a kid? My sense is some of it is a
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:33.680]   feeling of -- at least in certain groups, you're having kids later, you've achieved something.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.840]   It's like there's a set of things I tried to achieve, going to college, getting a job,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.400]   getting promoted, whatever it is, and then this is another thing. I'm going to totally win it.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.400]   I'm going to win my kid the way that I won partnership at Ropes & Gray. That's what I'm
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:58.560]   doing. It's hard to realize sometimes, but it's very true that the amount of control you have
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   over your kid's success and outcomes is quite a bit less than many of us think. The corollary of
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   a lot of the choices we make probably don't matter as much as we think is that you could
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.880]   do everything right, even if that were a thing. Then your kid might not turn out to be an Olympic
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:28.720]   athlete like you had hoped or whatever was your dream. That loss of control, that's really hard.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:35.200]   That's really hard for a lot of people. I think sometimes people would benefit by asking a little
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:41.760]   bit more, "What do I want my life to look like with my kid right now?" rather than, "What am I
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:49.840]   trying to build?" It's not that we don't want to look… I mean, our job is to raise our kids to
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:58.240]   leave us and to raise our kids to be adults, but also I can feel sometimes that people don't have
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:07.920]   the fun that they could with their kids because they're trying to achieve something. Sometimes
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.040]   you just want to have fun. Yeah. You mentioned that the outcomes don't matter as much as you
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.520]   might think. For someone who might not believe that they can't have a bigger impact on their
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.520]   kid's future, is there any kind of data or anecdotes that you'd point them to that maybe
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.240]   will help them realize they might not be correct? There's a little bit of a kind of tension in the
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:39.520]   academic literature here because there are many, many individual things that people do. What does
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   your kid do? Do this kind of extracurricular? Do you enroll them in these math things? Whatever.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.240]   All this kind of stuff that people think a lot about where then when you look at the relationship
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.000]   with outcomes, you just don't see much. That's true for something like breastfeeding also.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.160]   People are like, "I just let the breastfeed for nine years." Actually, the correlations between
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.080]   breastfeeding and IQ are just correlations. Those are not causal in the best data. There's many of
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.240]   those things where you can point to data and just say, "Look, we don't see that these things are
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:20.880]   driving outcomes in a meaningful way." On the flip side, there is a very important part of the
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:28.640]   first three years of kids' lives and even longer than that where you start to already see very big
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.360]   differences across, say, socioeconomic groups in how kids are coming into kindergarten in terms of
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.720]   their readiness to learn, in terms of their readiness to move forward, and in terms of long-term
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:48.400]   psychological health. But when you isolate what's going on, a lot of it is kids really benefit from
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.800]   having a stable adult who expresses love, from having a place to eat, a place to sleep that's
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:02.400]   consistent, having enough food, and maybe hearing some language, some pretty basic things which,
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.200]   unfortunately, not every kid in America is getting. But most of the people who are most worried about
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   investing in their kids in these ways are doing all of those things.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.760]   So we're obsessing about a bunch of small stuff on the margin that doesn't matter
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   because we have heard the first three years are really crucial. The answer is the first three
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.480]   years are really crucial, but you've already done it by the time you are starting to think about,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.040]   "Is it really important that my kid go to a Montessori school?" By the time you're down to
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.360]   how many master's degrees do the preschool teachers have to have, everything is fine.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.880]   Everything is already as much as you can do. Does that mean the parent thinking about that
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:50.080]   question might need a good enough approach, not a perfect approach?
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   I think it depends a lot on whether that approach is serving them. In some sense,
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.160]   we'll put myself in this category, sort of effectively overthinking a lot of parenting
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.360]   decisions is helpful. The fact that I thought about it and was careful and made a thoughtful
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:14.880]   decision, that helps me psychologically because later when I question my decision, I have this
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:20.080]   confidence. I know I made the decision in a way that was thoughtful and was the way that I want
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:26.000]   to show up for decisions. So I think that can be very valuable. I think that when this gets into a
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.280]   place where people feel overwhelmed or paralyzed, or they're constantly messing up, I think that's
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.240]   where stepping back and saying, "Hey, let's embrace a little bit of the second best parenting,
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:47.120]   like kind of good enough," is a good idea. I see some parents that are focused so much
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   on providing everything perfect for the kid that maybe they don't even take a second for
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.960]   themselves. How important do you think it is for people to also prioritize themselves as a parent?
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   There's a guy I really like named Tom Phelan, who is the author of what was once, I think,
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:12.480]   the most popular discipline book for parents called 123 Magic. It's still a very popular book.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:20.720]   But I talked to him at some point and he was talking about the idea that there are different
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.200]   dyads in the family. There's each parent with each kid, there's the kids together,
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:32.240]   and that it's one of the things that you want to prioritize is connections between each of those
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.280]   dyads. Then he said to me, he said, "What is the most important dyad in the house?" I said,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:43.440]   "I don't know, the parent to the oldest kid?" I had some idea. He was like, "No, it's the two
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   parents." I was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah." I think that's part of this for me is as we get so focused
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.200]   on our kids, we can forget ourselves and we can forget our relationships outside of the kids.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:07.520]   Those are both pretty important to prioritize for the family because parents are people also.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:16.320]   I assume children are watching those things also. Not everything they learn is the things you've
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:23.280]   taught them. But seeing happy mom and dad, not tired, not stressed out, probably has an impact
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.080]   that might be hard for data to quantify. I think that's probably right. Our kids
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.000]   learn a lot better from seeing than from being told. That's not their preferred mechanism of
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.840]   learning is to have things explained to them. Certainly, the image of my parent is willing to
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.680]   prioritize themselves communicates something. I think we worry that that communicates,
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:56.800]   "I don't care about you." But at some level, it doesn't. I will say this is something just at a
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:10.160]   personal level I struggle with quite a lot. I do not do a good job, mostly, of saying that I need
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:18.560]   time. For me, actually, the only thing that works is running. I just because I, for whatever reason,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.960]   have convinced myself that running is important for health, even though it's definitely not true
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:29.200]   at the level that I'm doing it. It's the one thing where I can tell my family, "This is really
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.600]   important to me. I'm going to do it. I'm going to leave you for it." They kind of accept. They're
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.840]   just like, "Okay. Yeah. Mom, it's really important for mom to go." Which I guess then inherently
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.600]   means it probably is important to your health. Yeah. No, it's important to my mental health.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:48.560]   It just may not be good for my knees. I come from a family of many replaced knees,
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.840]   so I've just accepted that that's in my future. You're just going to get a new one. Yeah. Think
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.360]   about how fast I'll be with my new bionic knees. It's going to be amazing.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.800]   I want to go back to something. Throughout the books you've written, and I've gotten through
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.760]   all of them at different stages, I already mentioned in the intro how valuable they were,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:11.280]   so I encourage everyone to take a look. You challenge a lot of common misconceptions. We
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.040]   talked about how many there are, but I'm curious if there's one or two that stand out as the most
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:24.480]   shocking ones now that you've dug into the data. My first book is about pregnancy, and there I
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:36.160]   think the one that really sticks out to me is bed rest. Bed rest in pregnancy is something that
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:44.000]   actually is still pretty commonly prescribed, and it just isn't effective for anything. There's
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.960]   basically no complication for which bed rest has been shown to be a good idea, and it also has some
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.720]   pretty negative outcomes. If somebody is concerned about preterm labor, they'll tell people to just
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.600]   lie down. I guess the reason I find this so interesting is because it strikes me as an
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:12.960]   example where the anecdotes of lived experience are basically getting in the way of data.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.800]   Most of the time when people have threatened preterm labor, they don't go into preterm labor,
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:28.320]   so that happens more commonly than actual labor. If you tell people, "Lay down for six weeks,"
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:36.720]   most of the time that will appear to work because it just would have worked.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   So it's such a clear example where if you had a control group,
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.640]   you would see that the outcomes were the same, but in the absence of the control group, if you
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.800]   just decide this is a good idea and you just start doing it, it looks like a good idea because most
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.400]   of the time everything works out fine like it would have anyway. It's just one of these things
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.560]   where as a person who cares about data and evidence, it's such a clear example where you
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:09.040]   can get into a path of doing something which is wrong but is self-reinforcing.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.400]   Now I assume that the doctors prescribing this bedrest have access to the same data
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.000]   you do and anyone does. Why does stuff like that keep happening?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.240]   So this is a place where I think even in the decades since Expecting Better came out,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.440]   the advice has changed a lot in part because some of the evidence, not because of my book,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.920]   but because the evidence slowly updates over time. But I think there's a lot of hysteresis in
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:39.600]   practice. So if you are an obstetrician and you've been prescribing this for many years and most of
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:48.240]   the time it seems to work, the idea of not doing it anymore because of some study I think is hard
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   because it's like your lived experience is that this works.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.760]   Yeah. I remember one distinct moment during our first child, you basically got a choice.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.520]   Do you want to meet with your OB before pregnancy like three times or do you want to go to group
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.000]   meetings six or seven times? Oh, right. Group prenatal care. Uh-huh.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.320]   Yeah. And we were like, "Oh, wow. We want more information." So we get six or seven times.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.680]   So we go to the first meeting and they asked a bunch of these preconceived myths and they were
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.040]   like, "How many of you think you can't?" And then the nurse went through like, "Have coffee,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.720]   eat sushi, have honey," and went through them. And I remember we had both just read Expecting
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.840]   Better and we were both like, "Yeah, that's okay. Yeah, that's okay." And everyone looked at mostly
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.840]   my wife like, "Oh my gosh, who is this person that's poisoning her child? What is going on?"
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   And the nurse eventually was like, "No, actually she's right." But even in a room in the Bay Area,
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:51.920]   lots of educated people, everyone seemed to keep believing things that I guess data has now
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.800]   disproven. Things like caffeine and even small amounts of alcohol being so terrible.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:08.000]   Where does this come from? Pregnancy is full of this abundance of caution
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.560]   attitude, I think. And with something like coffee or sushi or even little bits of alcohol,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:24.400]   I would get people to be like, "Yes, I looked at that data. You've convinced me with the data
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:34.240]   that some amount of caffeine in pregnancy is okay, but I still wouldn't do it."
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:40.560]   Instead of pushing, "But why?" It's like, well, and I think some of it is just the feeling of
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:49.040]   if something bad happened, I would blame myself. And especially early in pregnancy when people
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.400]   worry about miscarriage, whatever, then the feeling of like, "I want to do everything right
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:02.960]   because then I will know if something bad happens is not because of something that I did." And I
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:09.760]   think that's actually a very hard psychological issue to get around. I'm worried about blaming
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.160]   myself partly because society is quite good at blaming women when things go wrong or just in
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:22.240]   general. I think people have to decide where they are emotionally on this. I think it's totally fine
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.920]   to say, "I think that we should have the evidence there. I think people should read the evidence,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:35.600]   and I think they should understand it." And I think we should work on the idea that sometimes
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:45.040]   bad things happen for reasons that are not in our control, and that is really sad, and that is just
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:52.240]   the way the world is, and that somehow we have to stop blaming people for things. And I think
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.520]   if we could do that, then people would feel a little more comfortable making some of these
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:01.280]   choices based on evidence. I think some of it is how other people look at you.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.440]   I can't remember if this actually happened to my wife or it was a friend, but someone took the
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.000]   coffee out of their hand when they were at a coffee shop, which I'm sure you've also heard
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.320]   stories of things like that happening. And so even though you might decide, "This is okay for me,"
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:25.760]   it seems like other people must not have this data because they're willing to go to such extremes to
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.600]   share their opinion, if that's the right way to say it.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.160]   I think those experiences for me go beyond, "This person doesn't have the data," into, "This person
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:43.600]   is willing to step over a line that I thought we had in polite society." And this happens all the
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.120]   time, more in pregnancy than with your kids, although it happens with babies also, where
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:55.360]   people just feel like somehow it's their business to say what you should do, to take the coffee out
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.600]   of her hand, to touch her belly, to say, "Well, I hope that's decaf, but why isn't your baby
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:09.120]   wearing a hat? Did you know babies get cold?" It's like, "What do you want me to say?" I think that
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:18.160]   our societal willingness to weigh in on people's pregnancy and parenting choices is somehow
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.600]   astonishing. I do think some of this is people don't have the data, but I think once you're at
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.440]   the point where you're taking coffee out of someone's hand, I'm not sure you would be compelled
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.600]   by evidence. That's just not okay. Yes, I agree.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:39.440]   At some point, we talked about having a line of cards that said, "Well, actually," on the front,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.880]   and then on the back, there would be information about caffeine or whatever in pregnancy,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   and you could hand them out to people. As someone who enjoys confrontation,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.080]   I would have really enjoyed having that deck of cards. I think my wife would much prefer to just
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.840]   walk away. Yes, just walk away, buy your coffee elsewhere. One other topic that I feel like maybe
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:04.560]   falls into the camp of "Heated with Controversy" that I'm curious about. I don't remember where
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.600]   the data ends up in that chapter of the book, but it's around sleep training, which I know is very
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:15.520]   polarizing. How did a topic like that get so polarizing, and what does the data actually show?
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.880]   If you're not deeply steeped in the internet discussion of sleep training,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:25.280]   when we talk about sleep training, we're generally referring to some system where a child is crying
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.800]   for some period of time during the night, and with the intention that they fall asleep on their own.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:37.440]   I'm guessing most parents that find this not a great method haven't actually learned about this
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.040]   Romanian study. This is the first I'm hearing about it. Do you think people just don't want
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.800]   to hear children cry, or why has it become so polarizing, absent knowledge about this
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:56.480]   Romanian orphanage? Sleep training is extremely polarizing
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:03.040]   because people worry that if you sleep train your kid, it will cause them to never be attached to
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:12.400]   you and to have long-term psychological issues. The origin of this is Romanian orphanages,
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:19.760]   basically. There was this very unfortunate, tragic episode in Romania where they took away
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.080]   birth control, and there were a lot of unwanted births. A lot of those kids ended up in these
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   orphanages, in which they were left basically alone for days on end, or not fed very much,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.800]   and there's a lot of sexual abuse. Many of those kids did very poorly, for reasons that I'm sure
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.280]   are obvious from that description, did very, very poorly as adults and had many long-term
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.640]   psychological and other consequences. When people from the West came and visited these
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.800]   orphanages, one of the things that they saw was that the babies were very quiet,
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:57.840]   that if you didn't ever come and help a baby for many days, it just would stop crying.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:06.400]   Then people took that and were like, "Sleep training is a little bit of a Romanian orphanage,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.320]   and so it probably is bad for kids. It's going to have all these same negative consequences."
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:18.400]   The thing is that there's just no evidence for that, and the difference between having your
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:27.120]   kid cry it out in a world in which they are loved and cared for and adequately fed and not abused,
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.760]   and etc., etc. The difference between that and a Romanian orphanage is so vast that I'm not sure
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:39.440]   that you can -- I think the comparison is a bit -- it seems ridiculous. At any rate, we have a
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:45.920]   fair amount of evidence on sleep training in places where we are thinking about sleep training as it
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.880]   is practiced, where kids cry it out and then they sleep. We can see that it does improve sleep. It
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.040]   does actually improve parent sleep, decreases postpartum depression. Then when you look at
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.760]   long-term outcomes, either long-term or short-term outcomes for kids, you just don't see any
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.520]   differences for kids who are sleep trained and not. There's just not any evidence in the data
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:11.760]   of this kind of attachment, these attachment issues. I think, first of all, there is a fair
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:18.000]   amount of talk on the internet, not so much about the Romanian orphanage, because I think people
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   recognize that that doesn't seem that parallel, but just in general about the idea of attachment
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:35.040]   theory and people saying, "We know this must be bad for your baby because babies are made to be
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.240]   with their mothers all the time." There's a lot of rhetoric on the internet about this, which I
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:46.640]   think is not super supported by data. It's also very unpleasant to listen to your kid cry. I don't
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:56.160]   want to sugarcoat, it can take a few days for this to work, and it's really unpleasant to listen to,
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.760]   and it is not for everyone. There are people who will tell me, "I just couldn't do this," and I
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:09.680]   think that's fine. This isn't something where I would say you have to do this. It's an interesting
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:19.280]   space where my sense is some of the debate online, some of the intensity of this debate is because
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:26.480]   both sides feel like they are being told they have to do something. Both the people who do the sleep
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.920]   training are told, "You're a terrible monster parent. I could never do that," which is frequently
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.760]   said. Then if you don't do it, people are told, "We have to sleep train. You don't sleep train,
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.200]   your kid's never going to sleep, and you're ruining them forever." Somehow, both sides feel
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.320]   like they're being told they're doing it wrong, as opposed to what I think is a reasonable middle
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.600]   ground, which is this absolutely can work for many families. There's no evidence that it would cause
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.160]   any long-term or short-term problems, but it's certainly not for everybody. If it doesn't fit
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.720]   what you want to do with your family, then you should feel free not to do it.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.640]   Maybe I'm wrong, but breastfeeding might fall into a similar camp?
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.680]   I think breastfeeding falls into a similar camp. It's interesting. I think the rhetoric on sleep
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:19.600]   training is actually, in some ways, a bit stronger. Rarely do people say, if you choose not
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.160]   to breastfeed, that you're a monster, whereas I do think people will say that about the sleep
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:33.200]   training. It has the same feel of people really disagreeing and falling in these very sharp camps,
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.800]   and people feeling judged. The evidence to suggest that breast is best is
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:44.080]   there are some small benefits, largely in the short-term, but many of the benefits that are
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.640]   dated about breastfeeding are not actually supported in the best data.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.880]   There's a lot of data around a lot of these topics. Honestly, I think the easiest way to
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:00.800]   tackle that data is to pick up a book that you've written on the stage of parenting that you're in.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:06.320]   At least that was our approach. But for someone who wants to go a little further and look at the
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.760]   data, what advice do you have for someone trying to think about how to even read these studies,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.640]   find this research, know that what they're looking at is the right stuff?
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:21.840]   The first thing I will say is that if you have started by looking for the answer to the question
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.240]   you want, you are already way ahead because often people will start by saying, "Well, I saw this
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.880]   study. Let me react to this particular study." But if your question is like, "I actually want
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.480]   to evaluate this question," you're in a much better position because you can go and you can
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:41.280]   actually look at sources that are vetted and are not somebody on TikTok who has some feelings about
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:48.480]   this topic. The best studies of almost any question are going to be randomized trials.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.200]   We're almost always better at learning from things where we randomize a treatment
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:58.720]   and give one group one thing and one group another thing because then you can be more confident that
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.680]   the differences that you see across groups are driven by the treatment rather than by
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   preexisting differences. There's a set of reviews called the Cochrane Reviews, which are meta
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.720]   analyses of randomized trials, which tend to be very good. So if someone said, "Where's the first
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.280]   place I would look?" and say, "Go to the Cochrane Library and see if they've done anything on it,"
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.680]   and that's often a very good starting point. I've just searched your site and you've usually
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:31.920]   done some of these things. Yeah. I mean, I think one of the core things we're trying to do on
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:38.640]   parent data is give people some depth and then citations. So it's like, if you want to go further,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.640]   here's the paper to read. Here's kind of the core of this literature, but you get some depth already
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:50.080]   with the parent data posting. And I know there are lots of different norms all around the world.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.200]   And so how much does it matter where these studies are done or how much do kind of cultural
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.520]   norms and traditions play into advice on these topics? Cultural norms and traditions play
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:07.680]   enormously into advice. And it is extremely interesting to talk to people from other
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:16.880]   countries about what kinds of things they hear. I have a friend, a colleague from Sweden,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.040]   and at some point, she was telling me, she was like, "In Sweden, no one would ever swaddle their
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.720]   baby," because everybody knows if you swaddle them, their hips will be ruined. They'll never
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   learn to walk. There was some specific thing. And it's just like, not only is that not supported
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:41.200]   by data, but I had never even heard that. This is not in the US. No one is anti-swaddle. Swaddle is
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.160]   just like a regular milquetoast thing that we're doing. But she was like, "In Sweden,
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.800]   that is a thing not to do." And then there was this time when I was pregnant, when one of my
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.920]   Chinese colleagues was like, "Are you wearing a radiation vest?" And I was like, "I'm not. What?"
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.240]   And he's like, "Everyone I know in China, when they're pregnant in front of their computer,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.560]   they wear this canvas radiation vest to protect themselves from the computer radiation."
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:12.160]   I was like, "Okay, there's no evidence for that." But it was just like, that's the cultural norm.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.480]   And there's so many of these places where you see these differing cultural norms.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:27.120]   There are also then, when we're studying some of these things, alcohol and pregnancy is a
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.360]   good example, where cultural norms are pretty different in the US and in Europe or Australia
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:40.640]   with that. There's more alcohol consumption, more occasional drinking in European or Australian
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.600]   context than there is in the US during pregnancy. And so most of the better data, the larger scale,
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:52.080]   less complicated data comes from those places, because you are more confident that this is a
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:58.880]   choice that is being made closer to at random or that is not really wrapped up in demographic
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:04.080]   differences across groups. Given the wide breadth of opinions
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.480]   all around the world, one challenge, and this probably the answer spans way beyond just
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.760]   parenting or pregnancy, but what advice do you have for someone who's read your book,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:22.400]   done some research, come to an opinion, and get some pushback with a doctor or a nurse
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.160]   that maybe has a different opinion, how to navigate that situation?
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.600]   One of the things I hope that our books will do is help that my books will do is help people
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:42.560]   have better conversations. In a sense, rather than framing that as an opportunity to say,
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:49.840]   "I think one thing and you think another thing," as an opportunity to say, "Hey, this is my
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.560]   understanding of the evidence on that. Can you tell me why you don't think that's relevant in my case?"
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.320]   We often frame some of these interactions as we're having a disagreement or my doctor's not
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:12.160]   listening to me, which does happen, but I think that we can use this as a jumping off point.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   Sometimes the answer will be, "Well, that's the advice I give everybody, but I don't really know
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.760]   why." It's like, "Okay, well, that's more informative than just this is what we tell
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.320]   people." Sometimes the decisions you might discuss with a doctor or a nurse or even your partner
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.200]   are either small or they're a little bit easy. Sometimes there are decisions that parents make
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.000]   that are much bigger and complicated. You mentioned childcare earlier. There's not one
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.760]   right answer and there are lots of different factors and variables. I think given your
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:52.480]   background on economics and decision-making, how do you give people guidance when they're making
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.600]   really complicated decisions like whether to return to work, have a second child,
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.920]   these kinds of things where there's so many variables, where it just feels like even if you
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.200]   ask the right question and collect the right data, actually making the decision is tough
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.240]   because there's not even close to a kind of right answer.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:20.480]   We are not very good at making hard decisions like that. I think that there's a core reason,
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:28.560]   which is that with one of these very, very hard, complicated decisions, for different people,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.440]   those are different. I think whether to have another kid is a common one for people to be
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:42.800]   a little stuck on. There's a sense in which you have to recognize that at the end of the day,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.680]   you will never know if you made the right choice. We really want to know that we made the right
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.800]   choice. For many of these choices, you're never going to learn that. You are never going to find
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.040]   out if you did it, if you would have been happier in the other option or things would have worked
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.360]   out better the other way. You just won't. You're going to have to live with the idea that you made
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:08.080]   a good choice ex ante, you made whatever is the best choice you made, and you're just never going
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:15.200]   to find out if it was right. That's the core reason people delay choices, I think, is that
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:24.160]   they're waiting around for something, either a better choice, like a third option that fixes all
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:29.840]   their problems, or they just can't live with the idea that they're not going to know if they're
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.160]   right, and so then they never make the decision. One of the things I will talk to people about
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:39.120]   sometimes is this idea that there's no secret option C, that when you have a choice between A
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:46.320]   and B, even if A and B both really aren't that great, you have to choose one of them.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.600]   People ask me, "So the classic example where I will talk about this is people who are thinking
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:59.360]   about a second kid, and one person wants a second kid, and one person doesn't." It's like, "My
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.920]   spouse is really committed to a second kid, and I'm really committed not to. How can we make this
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:11.040]   decision?" The only thing you can say is there's no secret option C. If you're having this discussion
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.920]   waiting for some option to arise that is intermediate between having a kid and not
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.360]   having a kid, you will never get that, because those two things are literally the opposite of
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.920]   each other. You're just going to have to make the decision knowing that one person is not going to
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:33.440]   get the thing that they want. Waiting around and not making a choice is the same as making a choice.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.240]   It's choosing in favor of the person who doesn't want to have a kid, because eventually you'll lose
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:47.200]   your ability to do that. We're not great decision-makers as people. When things are
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.520]   hard, we just put them off. Sometimes we just have to force ourselves to make a choice.
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:57.840]   Yeah. It's funny. The same thing is probably true with, "Do you want a will or not?" Well,
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:03.440]   not having a will means you're just having a will that is whatever your state decides your will is.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.600]   That I've brought up with a few people. They've been like, "Oh my gosh. I didn't want to go
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.280]   through this process, but I already did. I just accepted this thing that I'm completely out of
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.840]   control for. Now, I'm really, really more motivated to figure this out for myself and our family."
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.600]   Yeah. The will one is a good example, because I think when we think about that,
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.960]   we're thinking about, "Should I make a will or should I not die?" Well, actually, not dying is
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.440]   not on the table. It's really just, "Do I decide what happens after or not, or do I let the state
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.240]   decide?" I don't know. I think people think about the prenups also. It's like, "Should I have a
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.360]   prenup? If I have a prenup, then I'll get divorced." It's like, "Well, you might get divorced
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.880]   anyway." Yeah. I think the data shows that that's at least a reasonable, likely outcome for almost
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:56.720]   any relationship. It does happen. There's a couple of decisions that I think are particularly
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   relevant for me, and so I'm just going to bring them up because they're interesting at the age
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:06.640]   of our kids. One of which I think... You mentioned there are lots of decisions that maybe don't have
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.240]   as much impact as you think, but there's one decision that I think is happening at least in
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:20.320]   my circle of kids that are in the 3, 4, 5, 6 range starting to go to school about the value
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.560]   of private education. The thing that I think is different than this about a lot of other decisions
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:33.680]   is the financial impact it can have. I have talked to friends, and I used to run a financial
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:42.080]   planning firm, people that put their personal finances at extreme tight places for the sake
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   of their children's education. It's one where it's hard to be like, "Oh, I don't care about
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.320]   my kid's education," but maybe good enough actually isn't as bad as you think and not worth
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:04.240]   stretching your finances. I guess I'm curious how much a "better education" really has an
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.880]   impact on things and how someone considering private education might think about it.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.240]   Really hard question to answer because the demographics of the people who have
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.600]   private education are very, very different than the average, particularly if you're talking about
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.280]   the kind of private education that would stretch your finances. In the US, there's public education,
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.680]   there's a large share of private education is Catholic schools. Actually, they tend to serve
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:37.280]   a pretty similar demographic to the public schools, and they tend to not be that expensive.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:44.720]   Then there's this space of independent private schools, which can be very, very expensive,
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.280]   which is closer to what you're imagining when you're stretching your finances.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:56.400]   When we look in general at schools, and let's say now let's compare different public schools,
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:04.240]   some of them are going to perform better on test score-wise than others. We would also frame that
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.920]   as some of these schools are better than others. There's better public schools. You could ask the
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.520]   same kind of question, "Should I stretch my finances to move to a district with a better
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.400]   public school based on this testing metric?" It turns out when you look in the data,
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:24.000]   most of those differences across schools are basically about differences in who is going to
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.240]   the school, which is to say moving your particular kid from school A to school B is not going to give
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.040]   them a boost in test scores that is the difference between school A and school B. It's going to give
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.600]   them at best a tiny fraction of that boost because most of the things determining how your kid is
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:47.200]   doing on this test or whatever is just what your kid is like and what happens at home and genetics
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.720]   and all the kinds of other stuff. The treatment effect of the school is small. That doesn't mean
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.360]   every school has a small treatment effect, but on average, a lot of the differences that people
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.000]   perceive out in the world are really differences in kids and not differences in schooling.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:10.800]   A similar point may be made about private schools, and people have made it, that some of
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.240]   the difference in performance and college outcomes and whatever is really about a difference in the
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:25.280]   kids who are going there and not a difference in the amount of treatment effect of the school.
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:31.120]   Having said that, there are some things that we know matter for kids' school learning, like the
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:37.360]   size of classes. It is true that private schools tend to have smaller class sizes than public
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   schools. That's the one very clear thing in the data, which does differ across school types
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:50.880]   and which shows up as impactful. This is a long-winded and very academic answer to this
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:57.040]   question, which is these differences are probably not as large as people perceive them to be.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:02.720]   It actually reminds me of a comment that someone made about saunas, which I will bring back.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:13.840]   There is data that shows that a sauna can have some positive health impact, but if you're eating
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.080]   cake and not exercising, the sauna is not where you should be focused to improve your health.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.960]   I'm curious. Private education might have smaller class sizes. That might have an impact.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.920]   But what are the things that are orders of magnitude more important on the outcome of your
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.280]   kids maybe past those first few years where we talked about having food and having shelter and
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:44.160]   those kinds of things that people should maybe reframe their thinking about from toddler beyond
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.200]   ages that are really important for parents to keep top of mind?
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.600]   It's an extremely good question because I've thought a lot about this. In some ways,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.800]   some of the answer is it's a lot of the same stuff that matters when your kid is little.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:05.440]   Which is having a stable place to live and enough to eat and family support. When we get into older
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:13.680]   kids, a lot of what people worry about is mental health. How do I have it be the case that my kid
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:19.360]   is resilient to the inevitable failures and complications and social issues and whatever
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.880]   that are happening in school? The answer to that is kids are more resilient when they
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:32.720]   feel that home is a safe place. Making home a place where kids feel not where you're fixing
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:39.120]   all their problems, but where they know when they show up there, somebody loves them
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.880]   unconditionally, even if they got a C on their math test or even if Sally pushed them down on
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:51.520]   the slide or said that their hair sucked or whatever was the thing in the day. That being
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:59.040]   a core stable space, that's ultimately how we're going to raise resilient kids. Probably much more
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.560]   important than is home a place that has Russian math or something.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:11.200]   Yes. Which by the way, I've heard lots of people say, "Oh, can't send them to public school. They
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:17.040]   don't teach language until fifth grade and this other school does at second grade." People are
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:23.520]   making decisions that cost tens of thousands of dollars a year on small little things like that,
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.440]   which might be important to them. I'm not trying to say that's not an important thing,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:33.120]   but it sounds like there are other things that if you're never around for your children...
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:41.920]   Yeah, I think there are always trade-offs and thinking about what am I trading off for this.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:48.080]   You always want to have that in mind. Yep. And one other topic that I feel
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:54.240]   data is probably constantly evolving that I'm curious about is around technology and screen
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:59.280]   time. Because I don't know, when I was a kid, yes, we had a television, but there wasn't an
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:05.120]   iPad that I could sit on all day, every day. And our kids are not quite at the age where
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:11.280]   they're playing games on iPads and watching TV all day. But I feel like in a few years,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.640]   their peers are going to be doing that whether we let them or not. And I honestly don't know
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.760]   how to think about it or whether the data is even developed enough.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:31.360]   Yeah, it's a messy space. And I think it's worth separating out the passive screen time piece from
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:42.480]   the active social media phone piece. Kids will watch television on screens. And I think there's
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:46.320]   a limit to how much of that they should do. But the way I often will frame that to parents I think
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:51.840]   is right is this is an opportunity cost question. So there's nothing per se wrong with your kid
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.480]   watching Caillou. If they're watching Caillou for seven hours a day, they're not doing other
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.840]   things like going outside and hanging out with you and going to school. And that's too much.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:08.640]   But is there anything inherently bad about access to some amount of screen time? No. It's just about
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.640]   setting boundaries and figuring out where does that fit in your family life and how do you leave
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:17.840]   enough time for the other things that you want your kid to be doing. So this is really a question
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:24.080]   of boundaries. When we talk about phones, then you introduce another set of issues. One is that
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:30.560]   it's actually very hard to set boundaries with phones. So when kids have access to phones,
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:36.640]   they have access to all of those things all the time. And we can try to set boundaries,
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.400]   but it's different than setting a boundary with a five-year-old with an iPad where you can just
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:48.160]   take it away. And if they scream like they're too short to reach it, it's hard to set those
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:53.360]   boundaries with a 13-year-old. And then we have a lot of debate about the question of social media.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:59.840]   And I think the evidence on that is mixed, but certainly suggests that for some kids,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.200]   social media is quite bad for mental health, particularly for girls.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.760]   So I don't know. I think we're in the middle of a bit of a reckoning. John Haidt's book,
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.040]   The Anxious Generation, has gotten a lot of attention. I think we're a little bit of a
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.400]   reckoning around phones and the question of what's an appropriate way for society to deal with kids
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:24.160]   and phones. Yeah. I haven't had to deal with it yet, but I had our nephew over this weekend,
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   and I was working on something on the computer. Since this show is called All the Hacks,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.320]   I figured one of the things we could do before we wrap is just ask if you have any kind of
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:37.840]   interesting or uncommon parenting hacks you've picked up along the way or read through research
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.280]   that people listening might find helpful. I think people are always shocked at the
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:55.040]   incredible rigidity of my household, particularly around sleep. We have a fixed wake-up time during
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:00.720]   the week, which is 6.50 for the kids, and on the weekends it's 7.05, and that's it. We do not
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:09.520]   deviate from that ever. There's no sleep in on the weekends. I have a teenager now. There's no
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:15.600]   sleep in during this. Everyone in the house is rigidly associated with these bedtimes,
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:21.200]   and I think it just comes from having decided sleep was the most important possible thing,
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:29.600]   and we just do it. I think when people visit, they're like, "Everyone's very rigid in this
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.760]   household." What happens when they wake up early? I would love to set 6.50, but today it was 6.10.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.840]   Yes, fair enough. One of my kids does wake up early, and then he just reads in his bed until
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:48.720]   the wake-up time. Okay. We covered a lot. Is there one takeaway,
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:54.240]   someone who is thinking about being a parent, is a parent, is a grandparent you want to leave them
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.680]   with? For someone who's thinking about being a parent, I think we talk a lot about the things
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.080]   that are hard in parenting, and it's expensive, and you have to think about every decision,
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.400]   but I always want to remind people the way that you will feel about your kid is hard to describe,
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.320]   and so while you're hearing about... We should talk about the parts that are hard,
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:20.400]   but I also want people to understand, not that you have to have kids, but this is a very cool
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:27.040]   experience, and it's really, really fun a lot of the time. Not all of the time.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:32.160]   Yeah, not all the time, of course, but I'll just add that as someone who,
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.120]   when hanging out with other people's children, was never all that excited about children.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:45.040]   Nieces, nephews, it's fine, but I didn't have this immediate attraction, like must have this,
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.680]   and so I was always asking myself, I was like, "Man, what if that's the same way I am with our
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:54.480]   kids? You'll never know," and I couldn't have been more wrong, and the more I bring this up
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.880]   with people, the more I find out that your opinion towards kids before having kids is completely
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:06.400]   different than your opinion after having them, so I will echo some of that sentiment.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.520]   People ask me what's the best parenting advice, and I will tell them the thing that our pediatrician
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.120]   told me when my daughter was two, and I had some obsessive thing about bees where I was panicked
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:21.760]   about the possibility of her getting stung, and she just listened to this whole diatribe,
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:27.680]   and then she told me, "Yeah, I would just try not to think about that," and I think there's
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.840]   many things in parenting where I will step back and be like, "I'm just going to try not to think
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:37.520]   about that," because it's getting in my head, and my rational mind tells me this isn't important,
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:43.760]   and I'm just not going to think about it. Love it. Where can everyone who wants to get more
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:48.560]   and stay in touch with everything you're working on go? Aside from the books I'm linking to,
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.760]   the site I'm linking to, all that will be in the show notes, but say it here as well.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:59.120]   Yeah, so parentdata.org is where I would start. That is where we have 1,500 articles about
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.480]   everything in parenting. There's an AI chat bot you can ask a question to. It is intended to be
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.560]   the place where you go instead of late-night panic Googling about your parenting questions,
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:14.880]   and you can find me on Instagram @ProfEmilyOster, and you can find my books on Amazon or wherever
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:21.520]   you buy books. Yeah, I'll link to all the books. We had a great time reading them, and reference
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.480]   now the family firm regularly when we're making decisions.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:27.120]   Amazing. Thank you, Chris. This is really fun.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.240]   Yeah, thanks for being here.
