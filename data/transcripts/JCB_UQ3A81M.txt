[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6 and
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.100]   reading from verse 10 to verse 13.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.640]   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.200]   Put on the whole armor of God,
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.600]   For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.880]   principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.880]   against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.960]   Wherefore,
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.320]   take unto you the whole armor of God,
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.800]   that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.120]   having done all,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.760]   to stand."
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.880]   These words, I say, are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6 verses 10 to 13.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.960]   Nothing is made so plain and clear in the teaching of the New Testament as the fact that the Christian is
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960]   a new man.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.600]   He's not merely a good man. He's not merely a better man than others.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.840]   He is essentially a new man.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.800]   What makes us Christian is that we undergo a rebirth,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.320]   that we become
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.760]   partakers of the divine nature that the life of God
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.680]   enters into our souls, that the Holy Spirit dwells within us.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.240]   The New Testament is forever emphasizing that. As the Apostle Paul puts it
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.560]   in writing his second letter to the Corinthians, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, a new creation."
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.960]   And the result of that is that all things are passed away.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.440]   Behold, he says, all things
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   are become new.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.480]   And that is, as I say, the great characteristic of the Christian. Everything is new to him. And that is so
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.840]   because he's got a new mind.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.200]   He sees things in an entirely new way and manner. He's got a new outlook, new
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000]   orientation.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.040]   His whole standpoint and attitude towards everything
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.600]   is influenced by this profound change that has taken place within him. So that, therefore,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.360]   anything that happens to the Christian immediately becomes a test of him as a Christian.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.640]   Because of this new mind and outlook, his reaction to everything
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.680]   is of necessity different from the reaction of other people.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.360]   I
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   say all that for this reason.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.000]   The Christian views a day like this, this Remembrance Day as we have come to call it,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.720]   in an entirely different way and manner from all who are not Christians.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.480]   We are in the same world as everybody else,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.160]   subject to the same events, same accidents.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.120]   We are citizens of this earthly kingdom as everybody else. And yet, I say because we are Christians,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.520]   nothing is the same to us as it is to everybody else.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.840]   We have our own peculiar, particular view of
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.600]   this day, this Day of Remembrance, as we have our own particular view of everything else. Very well,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   then, a day like this, I say, comes as a test to those of us who claim to be Christian.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.360]   What does it mean to us?
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.400]   How do we view it?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.040]   How should we observe it?
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   What is its message to us?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.680]   What is its meaning? What does it really represent?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.360]   Now, there are many possible ways of reacting to a day like this.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.920]   There are many different ways in which it can be observed.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.160]   There are many different ways in which a service in a Christian church
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.040]   can be conducted on this day. It can be something purely formal,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.400]   dictated by the circumstances.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.800]   Purely formal, without any real life or spiritual content. It can be purely national,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.320]   regarded entirely from the national standpoint.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.920]   In other words, it can be observed in the way that the world outside observes it, except that there is a kind of
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.120]   religious veneer or atmosphere added to it. But, essentially, something national.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.960]   It can be an occasion for pride,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.480]   and self-congratulation.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.320]   It can be nothing but an occasion for mourning.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.160]   It can be an occasion for thanksgiving.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   It can be, and probably will be very largely today, an occasion when people will consider the international situation,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.840]   and express themselves
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.080]   with regard to international politics as to what should be done and what shouldn't be done, and so on and so forth, working out the various
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.760]   classifications of armaments and things of that description. Now, there are many ways in which then this day can be approached.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   But I want to suggest this morning
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.800]   that the truly Christian way of approaching it is the way that is indicated in these words
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.360]   that we are looking at together.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   Here is the spiritual approach.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.920]   And it's not only the spiritual approach. It is, at the same time, of course, the only
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.880]   radical, the only deep way of
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.560]   approaching it. That is,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.240]   we claim for the New Testament teaching, for the Christian gospel,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.680]   the outstanding characteristic of the biblical view of everything. It's a profound view.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.720]   It's never content with just looking at things on the surface.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.880]   It's not just observational. It doesn't give the
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.600]   obvious answers and explanations.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.240]   It's never concerned merely about the clichÃ©s.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.360]   The great characteristic of the biblical view of the whole of life and of the whole of human history is
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.160]   profundity. It goes down to the very depths.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.200]   It rarely, and it alone, raises the
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.280]   fundamental questions. And it alone has an adequate answer to those questions.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.760]   Well, I'm suggesting, therefore, that here is the true way of approaching
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   this particular day of remembrance. The Apostle here really leads us
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.520]   to the very heart of the matter.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.920]   Now, those who attend here regularly will know that we've been looking at this statement for a number of Sunday mornings.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.560]   Because the Apostle here lays down this great proposition.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.360]   This world of ours, and the whole course of human history,
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.240]   is, in the last analysis,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.960]   nothing but the arena
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:14.040]   in which a mighty spiritual conflict is taking place. And that is a conflict
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   between God and the forces of heaven, and
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.080]   the devil, and the forces of evil and of hell.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.440]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.200]   but against principalities and powers,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.880]   against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.960]   Now, that, according to the Bible, is the real ultimate explanation of the whole of human history.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.800]   Biblical history, secular history, outside the Bible.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.280]   That's the ultimate explanation of it all. So we've been
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.760]   going back and we've been tracing
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.880]   the biblical teaching with regard to the origin of evil, the origin of the devil, and of these
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.760]   principalities and powers. And not only that,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.360]   we have seen how these
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.960]   powers and forces
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.760]   first entered into human history.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   It's the great story of the fall. And you can't understand the world today without the doctrine of the fall.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   There is no other explanation.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:26.280]   All the talk of the philosophers and the psychologists has been ridiculed by the history of this 20th century.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.560]   The fall alone explains why man is as he is. So we have seen
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.880]   that as the result of the fall, when the devil came and tempted men, and
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.200]   men in his folly listened and fell, we have seen that the result of that has been
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.760]   that the devil and these powers
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   have been
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.240]   dominating the life of mankind. Man is the slave of sin.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.920]   He is the slave of the devil. The devil is the god of this world. We are in the kingdom of darkness by nature.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.680]   That's the great teaching of the Bible. And then we have seen that the devil and his forces exert this power upon us.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   And they do so by attacking our minds first and foremost.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.200]   But not only our minds, our moral nature, and indeed even our bodies.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.200]   We've been looking into all that, and we have seen that there is more to follow. The whole question of demonology, devil possession,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.520]   the whole question of spiritism, and many of these occult
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.960]   problems and
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.720]   events which take place. All that is a part and parcel of this great teaching.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   Now there we've been looking at it all as it applies primarily to the individual.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.920]   But this morning we are to look at it on a vaster scale, a larger field.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.160]   For the devil does not confine his operations
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.080]   to attacking individuals.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.720]   It is an essential part of the teaching of this book that he does so with the larger groupings of mankind,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.800]   with states, with nations, with continents.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   He operates on this worldwide scale as well as upon the
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   individual person.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.920]   And now what we want to consider this morning is the teaching which we have at this point.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   With regard to that, we shall return again, God willing, to the more individual aspect of this matter.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.880]   But today, surely, it behoves us to look at it more in general, and in any case, we have to do so
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.240]   to be true in our exposition
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.440]   of what we are told here. Very well.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.760]   Let me try and summarize the principles which are taught here and in the whole Bible
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.040]   with regard to a day like this, a day of remembrance, a
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:54.600]   day in which we remember particularly two world wars that have taken place within this one century.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   And we are all aware of the state of the world at this moment.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.320]   We see these horrible armaments being piled up.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.360]   Are we on the brink of a third world war? These are the thoughts that are in the minds of everybody.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.040]   But now, let's see how the Bible approaches it all.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.520]   The first thing that he deals with is the cause of wars.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.840]   What's the cause of it all? Now, that's the first question.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   You see, the tragedy today is that people don't seek the causes.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:35.480]   They're so bemused by particular symptoms and manifestations that they proceed at once to them and to apply their medicaments to them.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   They've never realized the cause.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:43.760]   They'll be talking about armaments and things like that, but the Bible doesn't. The Bible is concerned about root causes,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   fundamental explanations. And what are they? What is the cause of it all? Well, here's the answer.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.320]   We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.240]   The answer is not merely human.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:03.360]   The causes of war are not to be found only in men.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.360]   Of course, so many think they are.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:13.680]   Ah, they say, if that Kaiser hadn't lost his head, there would never have been the first world war. Then that man Hitler, and so on.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.040]   Stalin, Khrushchev, so on. They're interested in men. That's the mentality of
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.640]   the politicians and many who follow them, the vast majority of the people. It's all a matter of men.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   "No," says the Bible.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.440]   "We wrestle not against flesh and blood."
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.200]   It isn't men. In other words, it isn't merely economic.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:41.840]   There are so many who think that the whole problem is purely economic. And if only you could deal with this
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.480]   fundamental problem of
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   economics. On the one hand, they say, if there wasn't communism, all would be well. And they, in turn, say, if there wasn't
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:55.280]   capitalism, all would be well. And both sides are agreed in thinking it's mainly an economic matter.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   Not so, according to this book, because that's ultimately human.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.880]   Neither is it merely something political.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.600]   That element comes in, of course. All these elements come in. But these are merely the things that are used.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.560]   That it is not a conflict against flesh and blood. Well, what is it, then?
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:22.800]   Well, the answer is that it is entirely the result of the operation of the devil and
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.320]   the principalities and powers,
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:32.080]   the rulers, the world rulers of this darkness, this spiritual wickedness in high places,
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.640]   or in the heavenlies, if you like. It's all the work of the devil,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:43.600]   as he operates upon individuals, as he operates upon these larger groupings. Now, the one
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.680]   supreme object of the devil is to bring in confusion and to bring in chaos.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:57.120]   Why? Well, because God's work is always characterized by order, by perfection.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.640]   Everything that God does is orderly, it's perfect, it has symmetry.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:08.480]   And the devil, hating God as he does, filled with pride and antagonism against God,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:17.240]   he is out, I say, to destroy God's handiwork. So he ever is a cause of turmoil, a cause of discard, a cause of
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.040]   confusion. And what can he do better in that respect than to produce war?
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.280]   And that is what he's been doing throughout the running centuries.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.160]   Now, James, you noticed in that fourth chapter of his epistle, in verse 1, says, "Whence come wars amongst you?"
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   He answers, "Even of your lusts, that war within you." But where do they come from? Well, we saw last Sunday morning
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   this is the work of the devil,
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.640]   playing upon the mind, playing upon the moral nature.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.600]   And thus he stimulates
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:55.080]   these unworthy elements in fallen men. And so you have your explanation of war. But let me work it out a little.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.680]   How does he do it?
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.920]   Well, what he does, of course, in the first instance, is to produce lawlessness.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.680]   You see, here is the devil attacking the mind.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.240]   That was the original temptation, lawlessness.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:15.120]   God had laid down his law for the men and the women in the garden. The devil immediately queries it.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.040]   Lawlessness, rebellion,
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:24.120]   setting law and order on one side, taking the law into your own hands, doing what you want to do.
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   That's the cause of war, ultimately,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.240]   of every kind of war.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.280]   It's the cause of the
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:37.040]   moral warfare in this country today. It's the cause of these major problems that are confronting us,
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.760]   these robberies with violence, murder, all that's happening to foul
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:50.560]   the life of this nation. It's ultimately due to lawlessness, and that's the devil. And you get that amongst nations.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:58.720]   This disregard for law and for the sanctities of law, that's the root cause, ultimately, of all wars.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.920]   People taking the law into their own hands. They may have signed agreements,
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.720]   they may have given their solemn pledge at a conference,
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.640]   but then, for their own reasons, they suddenly break it all, take the law into their own hands, and act.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.840]   Isn't that the cause of war? But that's what's produced by the devil.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:20.480]   He produces lawlessness and rebellion. And then, to work it out a little more in detail,
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.280]   he works, as we saw in the individual last Sunday, upon our pride.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:35.520]   And I suppose the most prolific cause of all war, wars throughout the centuries, has been just this question of pride.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:43.760]   It's been the cause of wars between individuals. It's been the cause of wars between nations.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.880]   Nations proud of themselves and their national sovereignty, and
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.880]   exaggerating themselves. And that, of course, always leads to jealousy amongst others, and envy and
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.000]   opposition, and so on.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.920]   You read your secular history books, and you'll find that
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:09.120]   pride is one of the greatest causes of war, and it's ever something that is produced by the devil. And then, with pride, of course,
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   goes greed and
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.920]   selfishness.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.920]   You put yourself first.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.760]   You feel that you're an exceptional person, and that you have a right to everything.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.320]   Nations feel that, that they have a right to possess the whole earth.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.920]   So they'll go and attack a nation without any provocation, and they'll conquer it, and they'll possess it. It's greed. It's selfishness.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.520]   It's just a manifestation of that original pride,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:41.880]   that exaggerated notion of self, this puffing up that was the ultimate cause, you remember, of the fall of the
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.280]   devil himself.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:50.520]   And these, working as forces, of course, ever lead to a spirit of distrust and
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.720]   of uncertainty.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.320]   You see that man beginning to set himself up, so you begin to watch him. And you, in turn, tend to have the same thing
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.040]   developing in yourself. And so the whole atmosphere of war is created. Now, these are the fundamental causes.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   There are foolish people who say it's making armaments that
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.480]   cause war, but the question is what makes men make their armaments?
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.720]   Why should they ever think of doing so? You've got to go back to the radical cause, and there it is.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.240]   Now, the Bible is full of illustrations of all this. The first great illustration, of course, is Cain.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.200]   Here are two brothers, Cain and Abel.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.960]   Here's psychology. Here's the profound biblical
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.680]   philosophy. Why are there wars? Well, there are wars because there are people like Cain,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.920]   began to feel jealous of his brother,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.160]   without any reason, without any cause.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.120]   But it's all this terrible thing that's introduced by the devil and the principalities and powers. This is what we're fighting against.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.560]   He insinuates into the mind, and we're not aware of it. We feel we're innocent. We never do any harm at all.
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:19:01.520]   It's always the other nation that does harm, but the other nation's saying exactly the same about us. Cain. There it is in a nutshell.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:07.480]   And all the various fights and quarrels. Look at that story of Naboth's Vineyard.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.360]   That king,
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.720]   Ahab, who had so many great possessions.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.560]   He wanted this other one. He had no right to it. It was this man Naboth's little possession.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.860]   But this great king, he must have it. He wants it. So he,
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.560]   instigated by his wife Jezebel,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   proceeds to take it in an unlawful manner. That's the cause of war.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:38.360]   That's what's happening on the scale of nations. You apply that and you'll see that you've got the explanation of most of the great wars of history.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.520]   Now, let's work this out on a larger scale.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:50.240]   This doesn't merely happen in individuals, and not merely in groups, and in nations. It happens on even a wider scale.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:56.000]   Look at the people before the flood, as you find them described in the sixth chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.480]   The lawlessness, the vice, the evil, and that always leads to quarrel.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.360]   Man setting himself up in pride, turning away from God. Look at the Tower of Babel.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:14.920]   That's another illustration of exactly the same thing. This is the pride of unregenerate, fallen men, always setting himself up.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:21.400]   Look at the wars that Israel had to fight against the other nations. It's all a part of the same thing.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:29.080]   Look what you read in the Old Testament about great dynasties like Assyria, and Babylon,
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.560]   and Medo-Persia, and Rome,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.840]   rising up.
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.160]   What's the cause of all this? Well, it's nothing but this inflated pride.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.320]   These great empires which try to spread themselves over the whole world, they come up one after another.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:52.200]   It's all described here, and they've been the cause of the wars, and the turmoils, and the wretchedness, and the unhappiness of the human race.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.800]   But I want to go even a step further.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.680]   So far, we've been looking at what I would call the general operation of the devil and his fossils.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:10.800]   The way in which, as it were, he keeps himself in the background, but nevertheless
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.240]   insinuates these ideas into the individual and into the nations.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.480]   But we must take it further,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.200]   because quite clearly there's another element which we must call the demonic element.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:31.520]   And as you look back at the biblical history, and at the secular history, you cannot but see this
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.240]   demonic element arising. Now, I mean this,
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.480]   that it isn't merely the selfishness, and the
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.600]   evil, and the pride, and all the rest of it. There's sometimes an additional factor.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.200]   Now, let me give you an illustration or two. Take that one
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.680]   which we had at the beginning in the fourth chapter of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   There was a man, you see,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.400]   into whom undoubtedly this demonic element came in.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.280]   He was not only inflated with pride and a sense of his own greatness, he went beyond it.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.920]   He wanted to be worshipped as a god.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.880]   He set himself up as a god, and he demanded people's worship. Now, it's just there the demonic element comes in.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.400]   That isn't mere
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.600]   evil, as it were. There is something further. There is a kind of possession. The man becomes possessed.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.680]   He gets beyond himself, beside himself.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.480]   Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.520]   Or, you've got the same thing in Antiochus Epiphanes,
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.960]   again described
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:42.920]   in the book of Daniel, and known in the secular history between the book of Malachi and the
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   gospel of Matthew.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.240]   That terrible period through which the Israelites, the children of God, had to go
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.600]   in the times of the Maccabees and so on. Here's another man who demanded worship, set himself up as a god.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.840]   Now, this is something extra. This demonic element comes in. And, of course, you had the same thing in the Roman Empire.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.200]   These men were not only great military conquerors, they began to set themselves up as gods.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.600]   They introduced emperor worship.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.680]   This was one of the great fights that the early Christians had to fight.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.240]   They said that Jesus is Lord.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.060]   But the Roman Empire said, "Caesar is Lord." And they demanded that these men should say,
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:31.120]   "Caesar is Lord." And they wouldn't say it. So they were thrown to the lions in the arena.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   Emperor worship. Caesar worship. Now, that's demonic. It's the only word for it.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:43.800]   It's a setting itself up for worship and for adoration. It's turning itself into a god. That's the thing the devil did.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.840]   That is the demonic element. You get the same thing in Muhammad.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   There is no question about that.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.400]   Muhammadanism has this same demonic element in it.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:59.920]   It is a man setting himself up and inflating himself. And it led to so many of the so-called
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.720]   religious wars.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.240]   And this demonic element is something that has persisted.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:12.760]   And it has continued to show itself from time to time in the long history of the human race.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:19.020]   Now, there are many disputed instances of this. Personally, I would not put Napoleon into this category.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:24.760]   I think Napoleon can be explained entirely in human terms and in terms of evil.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   I don't think the demonic element was there.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.360]   He was just an outstanding military genius whose genius ran away with him. But when you come to a man like Hitler,
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.280]   there is no question about it.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.880]   Here is a man who demanded a kind of personal attitude of worship and of adoration.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.600]   Here is a man who was, in the wrong sense, religious.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.060]   A man who worshipped himself. He worshipped his own race. He worshipped his own administration.
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.120]   The demonic element clearly came in.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.480]   He demanded a complete control over the minds of men, over the whole of men.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   Now, that's where the demonic element comes in. Napoleon never did that.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.680]   It's no part of my purpose to defend Napoleon,
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:14.960]   but it is important we should have clearly in our minds this demonic element, and where exactly it comes in.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.240]   You've got it, I say, in a man like Hitler. And undoubtedly, you've got it in a system like communism.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.400]   For communism rarely believes in a worshipping of the state.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:33.920]   It doesn't stop merely at an economic order. A man, again, has got to give this totalitarian allegiance.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.880]   It claims a right over man's thinking. The scientist has got to think within prescribed terms.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:45.400]   Your novelists have got a right within prescribed terms. There it is. It is in communism as it was in Hitlerism.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.440]   Anything that turns into a worship of a man, or of a state, or of a system,
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.640]   anything that demands a totalitarian allegiance, is demonic.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.080]   Let's be honest, there have been evidences of that in the history of this, our own country.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.040]   There are people who are still guilty of it. They're not aware of it.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:09.240]   It's never been an official policy in this country, but in practice and in private, it has very often been present.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   There has been a kind of mystique about the British Empire, which to me has had demonic elements in it.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.640]   And that is where we all needs must be careful.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.720]   Well, now, I'm giving you certain great principles very hurriedly, but that is the biblical
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.320]   explanation as to the cause of war.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.680]   You don't stop at men, you see. You don't stop at economic or political causes.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.640]   Behind it is this other element,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:42.280]   manifesting itself in one or the other of these various ways. But let me hurry to a second principle.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:49.800]   What, according to the Bible, have been God's enactments in the light of this?
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:57.680]   What has God, as it were, been doing in the light of this activity of the devil, and the
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.360]   principalities and the powers and the world rulers of this darkness, the spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.320]   And it seems to me we can divide the answer into two main sections.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   There have been what I would call the temporary measures taken by God.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   What do I mean by the temporary measures?
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:24.280]   Well, I am referring to the institution of governments
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.160]   and of powers that be. You remember the classical statement is in Romans 13 at the beginning,
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:38.640]   "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. The powers that be are
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.480]   ordained of God."
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.520]   Now then, here is the first part of the answer.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:51.400]   Because of this influence of the devil and his forces and evil and sin,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.680]   God introduced the notion of government.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.920]   Kings and princes and
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.120]   magistrates, and
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.600]   he gave to them certain powers. As Paul puts it there, "The magistrate beareth not the sword in vain."
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:16.480]   Governments not only lay down laws, they enforce them. They have the power to do so. They are able to
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.440]   demand forms of punishment for law-breaking. That is the whole essence of the notion of government.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.760]   Now, it is the biblical teaching
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.720]   that it is God who has introduced government, not men.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:38.320]   It isn't men who gradually evolved from the tribal ideas into the notion of governments as we think of them.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   It is God who prescribed it.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.360]   The states and governments are of divine
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:51.360]   ordination. And what are they for? Well, here is the answer. They are meant to restrain and to keep within bounds
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.480]   these forces of evil and of chaos,
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.240]   which are ever being enlivened by the activity of the devil and his powers.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:10.680]   Here they are, trying to cause dislocation and chaos and turmoil and war. The business of government is to restrain them, to keep them in order.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.360]   That is the essence of the biblical teaching. God instituted the whole notion of government, and
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:26.760]   that is the primary task of government, is to preserve law and order and to prevent chaos.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.720]   But that isn't the only thing we find here. There is another element.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:40.520]   Quite clearly, God has permitted certain things to happen from time to time.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:47.760]   God has allowed certain persons and certain powers to arise
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.200]   and to arrogate unto themselves almost endless powers.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:30:00.400]   There have been many attempts in the history of the world on the part of individuals and nations and empires to dominate the whole world.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.120]   They have tried to become world conquerors.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.200]   They have said that they wanted to produce peace and order,
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.200]   but they said the way to do it is for us to conquer everything, and we'll keep everybody down,
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.080]   and then there'll be no war, because we will be preserving peace.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.240]   And God has permitted this.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.720]   He permitted it, do you remember, before the flood?
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.360]   He permitted those foolish people to build their tower of Babel unto heaven.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.720]   They thought they'd got all knowledge. They'd encompassed the whole of truth.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.280]   They were going to build a tower right into heaven. He allowed them to build it up to a point.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.480]   We've seen that he allowed Nebuchadnezzar to do what he did.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.840]   You'll read again in the fifth chapter of Daniel that he allowed a man called Belshazzar,
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:44.600]   who was the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, to do almost exactly the same thing.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:51.480]   He allowed the Assyrians to build a mammoth empire that looked as if it was going to conquer the whole universe.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   He allowed Egypt to do it. He allowed Alexander the Great to do it.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.920]   This made a Persian, Greek dynasty.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:05.120]   He allowed the Romans to do it in their great Roman Empire.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   And later, he allowed Turkey to do it.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.360]   Mohammed and the Turkish Empire looked as if they were going to conquer the whole world.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   Now, here is the interesting teaching.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:24.680]   God, in his eternal and inscrutable wisdom, seems to allow these powers and these persons to do these things.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.480]   They rise up and they spread themselves.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.760]   They, as it were, try and attempt to stride the world as some sort of a colossus.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.560]   And indeed, nothing seems to be able to stop them.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.320]   And on and on they grow, and people tremble, and the whole world is quaking.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.680]   And you feel here, at last, is a man who is a semi-god.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.360]   But invariably, without a single exception,
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.400]   just when the man has arrived at the very zenith of his power,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.040]   God suddenly rises against him in judgment,
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:08.800]   and pronounces his judgment upon him, and brings him down, and destroys him and his power.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.080]   Oh, that's a great story in Daniel 4.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:19.600]   Look at this man who stands up as a giant, as a god almost, and demands the worship of the people.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.160]   Yes, but look at him, in a few months, there he is like an ox in a field, eating grass.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.200]   And look at his nails, they're like talons.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.040]   And look at his skin, it's almost got the feathers of a bird upon it.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.760]   What a fool, what a monstrosity.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.560]   What's happened to him?
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.800]   Oh, it's God, who has just put him in his place, reminding him that there is only one God,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.040]   and that nobody is to be worshipped but God.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.520]   Now this is, to me, the most interesting fact in human history in many ways.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.800]   How God has never allowed any man, or any nation,
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.240]   or any power, or any theory, to dominate the whole.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.520]   And, my friends, he never will.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:03.120]   Let every empire beware.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:07.360]   An empire that begins to lose its head and imagines it's endless and almost divine,
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.800]   is certain to come to destruction, as Nebuchadnezzar came.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.880]   And look at Belshazzar, there he is in his feast,
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:20.880]   with his concubines and his drink, typical modern potentate, isn't he?
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.440]   And what's he using for his drink?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.560]   He is using the vessels taken out of the temple of God in Jerusalem.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   He is using these very holy cups to drink his drink,
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.840]   and to have his revelry with these concubines and all his associates.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.920]   But you remember what happened, don't you?
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.280]   In the very midst of the feast and the jollifications,
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.080]   and the rejoicing about his greatness, the hand, the hand and the writing,
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:55.840]   "Mene, mene, tekel, euphazim, thou hast been weighed in the balances and found wanting,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.520]   thy kingdom is judged, you've come to the end."
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.040]   And down he goes.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   And so it is with all of them.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.800]   Alexander the Great dies at an early age of an aneurysm.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.600]   Rome, in all its greatness, when it felt that it was supreme,
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.120]   was conquered by the Goths and the Vandals and the barbarians.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   Turkey, likewise, was brought down.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.600]   What of Egypt by now?
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.760]   And so it has been with every one of them.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.960]   God permits these things for a while, but only for a while.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.200]   He rises, suddenly they're destroyed.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.160]   Read the story of Assyria in your Old Testament.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.920]   It's the great story everywhere.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.360]   Well now, there then is God's temporary measures.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.440]   That's how he acts in a temporary fashion.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.000]   But of course, God doesn't merely take temporary measures.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.440]   He's got an ultimate measure.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   And that's the theme of the Bible.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.320]   What is the ultimate measure?
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:48.880]   Well, it's this.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.480]   He announced it in the Garden of Eden.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.040]   When men fell, God came and said to the men,
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.480]   "There's going to be a warfare between the seed of that serpent and your seed.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.120]   There'll be a terrible fight," he said,
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.320]   "a conflict between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:11.520]   But the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.640]   This is not a temporary measure.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.920]   This is the ultimate measure.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.320]   God is introducing his new kingdom.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.560]   It starts there in the Garden of Eden and it runs on through the Old Testament.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   Christ came in the fullness of times.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.920]   It's the bringing in of the kingdom.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.040]   It'll go on until you come to the fulfillment of what you read in the book of Revelation.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.840]   "When the kingdoms of this world shall have become the kingdom of our God and of his Christ,
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.480]   when the devil and all his forces will be finally routed
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.800]   and all will belong to them and cast into the lake of fire and of burning."
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.160]   That's the ultimate purpose.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.200]   That's the great message of the Bible.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.560]   Don't confuse between them.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.880]   The temporary measures, the ultimate measure.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.280]   These are only temporary things.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.760]   God allows these to rise, brings them down.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.680]   Another arises, down they go.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.800]   This is all temporary.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.160]   Keep your eye on the ultimate.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:11.120]   The kingdom of God, the kingdom of light, the kingdom of heaven, it's coming.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.480]   It's being introduced.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.400]   Its citizens are being gathered together.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.960]   It'll go on until the final clash.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:26.720]   And Christ, the Prince of Peace and the King of Righteousness, will reign supreme over all.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.480]   Very well, let me come to a third principle, which is this.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.640]   What is the Christian's duty then in the light of all this and in the midst of all this?
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.560]   Let me but give my answers in the form of headings.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.080]   One, it is to avoid and to restrain all causes of war.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   What are they?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.680]   The things I've already been talking about.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.240]   A Christian never says, "My country, right or wrong."
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.600]   A Christian never says that.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.400]   That is terrible sin.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.920]   He doesn't say, "My country, right or wrong."
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.440]   He is never a party to jingoism.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.280]   Secondly, he is a man who should refuse to fight in an aggressive war.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:13.440]   If his country sets out in an aggressive war
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.080]   to steal another nation's property or country or whatever it is,
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.400]   the Christian should refuse to participate.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.280]   He must never be guilty of this pride in himself or in his nation.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.640]   He must never be guilty of this selfishness, this greed, this avarice, this evil spirit.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.480]   He stands against it, and he must refuse to be any partaker in it.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.680]   Well, what is he to do then?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.560]   Well, he is to aid the state and the government, which is appointed of God,
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:53.840]   to arrest and to subjugate as far as is possible the forces of evil, by which I mean this,
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.200]   that he isn't a man who contracts out of it, saying, "I'm a Christian.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.640]   I don't take part in this.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.520]   I start a campaign of civil disobedience.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.120]   I don't take part in war."
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.320]   He doesn't say that.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.120]   He doesn't take part, as I say, in an aggressive war.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.440]   But I would argue that it is his duty as a citizen to take part in a war
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:18.720]   that is meant to restrain aggression and to punish evil and to keep it within bounds.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.080]   The powers that be are ordained of God.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:23.760]   Pacifism is heresy.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.520]   It is not Christian teaching.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   The Christian does not contract out.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.680]   It is a part of his business as a creature, a citizen of God's kingdom, to aid the powers
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:40.720]   that be, to restrain evil forces and to keep them within bounds, even to the extent of
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   fighting in a war, but never in an aggressive war, only ever always to restrain evil and
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.840]   to keep it within bounds.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.240]   That, it seems to me, is the duty of the Christian in the light of all this.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.560]   And that brings me to my last general heading and principle, which is this one.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.560]   What is the future outlook, therefore?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.680]   What have I got to say this morning?
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.840]   Well, it's obvious, isn't it, from what I've been saying.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:15.760]   There is nothing which is so fatuous and so ridiculous as the false optimism which followed
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:22.640]   especially the First World War, the ridiculous blind men who described that as the war to
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.920]   end war, the people who then went mad thinking that the League of Nations was going to put
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.960]   an end to war.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.320]   There is nothing that I know of that is more unchristian than that.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.640]   That is complete spiritual blindness.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:40.400]   A man who can believe that has never understood the essence of the biblical teaching concerning
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.120]   the fall.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.840]   Do you remember the excitement about the Locarno Pact?
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.600]   They thought, "At last we've done it, a pact to outlaw war."
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.400]   We didn't have to wait long to see the folly of that, did we?
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.720]   And, my dear friends, it's still the same.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:01.440]   A man who believes that any league or union or organization is going to banish war is
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.640]   a man who has never understood the spiritual teaching of the Bible, never understood it.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.760]   He hasn't seen it.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.840]   He's thinking in terms of flesh and blood, and he doesn't understand the nature of men.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.080]   He hasn't any knowledge of the devil and the principalities and powers.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:18.800]   Men will never introduce an era of peace.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.920]   We are not promised it.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.280]   The Bible says we'll never have it as long as man is in sin.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.560]   You say, "What terrible pessimism."
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.600]   Yes, it is, but it's the truth.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.400]   It's realism.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:35.680]   There's nothing that I know of that is so fetuous as to lash ourselves up into a false
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.760]   optimism just to feel a little bit happier while we're in a service and then go back
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.600]   and face the world as it is.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:48.000]   My dear friend, it is the Son of God who said, "There shall be wars and rumors of wars."
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.880]   Whence come wars amongst you?
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.280]   Even of the lusts that war within you.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.520]   And while there is lust in men, there'll be war.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.640]   How can you hope to put an end to war while men have lust towards another man's wife
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.160]   or his possessions or anything?
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:02.880]   That's war.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.200]   And nations are nothing but aggregates of individuals.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.880]   And there is this demonic element, the devil, as long as he has any power, will produce
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.000]   chaos and confusion and antagonism and war.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.960]   You say, "What a terrible picture.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.520]   I wish I hadn't come to this service."
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.020]   I see.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.000]   Is that your attitude?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Are you content just to pull down the blinds and not to face facts?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.640]   That's to abdicate.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.080]   That's to run away.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.840]   That's not to use your reason.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.520]   No, no, let's face it.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:41.680]   Primarily the Bible is pessimistic because it's realistic, but oh, ultimately, here
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.840]   is the optimism, here is the assurance.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.400]   How do I face the future?
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.560]   As a Christian, I face it like this.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.080]   I expect nothing from men.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.680]   I expect nothing from conferences.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.560]   I expect nothing from leagues or United Nations organizations.
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.760]   Call it what you will.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.120]   That's why I don't preach about them.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.480]   I don't want to waste my breath.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.160]   I don't want to waste your time.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.240]   They're simply turning round and round in a circle.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.640]   They're temporary expedients that ever come to nothing.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.200]   It's not a part of the spiritual message at all.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.880]   I expect in the future what?
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.720]   Anything.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.480]   Anything.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.360]   I shall be surprised at nothing.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.240]   There may be a period of peace.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.320]   There may not be.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.680]   I don't know.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.400]   Nobody knows.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.440]   Anything is possible from men in sin.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.240]   There have been long periods of temporary peace, but only temporary.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.400]   There have been periods when you've had war after war, a hundred years war.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.080]   You may get any of that in the future.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:44.880]   I can't tell you.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.520]   We don't know.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:53.440]   But what I do know is this, that that's the sort of thing that will go on until
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.720]   God's appointed day shall have arrived.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:00.800]   He's got a day.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:04.320]   He's got an appointed day.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.000]   There is a definite end to history.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.880]   I don't know when.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.520]   I don't understand the times and seasons.
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.320]   The Bible tells me not even to try to do so.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:24.240]   All I know is this, there is the promised day of God, the day of the Lord.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:32.400]   The day when the Lord Jesus Christ shall come back as the King of kings and the Lord of
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:41.040]   lords, riding the clouds of heaven surrounded by the holy angels, and he will destroy his
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:47.200]   every enemy, the devil, the principalities and powers, the world rulers of this darkness,
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.280]   the spiritual wickedness in the high places.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.080]   They will all be finally destroyed.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:44:02.080]   When Jesus shall reign, where'er the sun doth his successive journeys run, his kingdom
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:08.960]   stretch from shore to shore, till moons shall wax and wane no more, there is a day coming
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:15.280]   when wars shall be no more, when there shall be no sorrow nor sigh, when the swords will
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.680]   indeed be turned into plowshares, when the lion will lie down with the lamb.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.800]   But when is it?
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800]   Oh, it's at the end of history.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:32.320]   It is when Christ ushers in his glorious, eternal, everlasting kingdom.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:39.200]   That is the ultimate outlook because it is God's ultimate plan.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:44.720]   So whatever you and I may have to endure, let's be prepared for it.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.800]   We may have to go through another war.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.760]   We may see a world power arising that will persecute us and cast us into prisons.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.320]   We may have to die for the name of Christ, like the first Christians did and many another
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.720]   Christian has had to do throughout the running centuries.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:44:59.520]   I don't know.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:12.320]   I don't know, but what I do know is this, that all who belong to Christ shall be with
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.840]   him in that kingdom of glory.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:20.240]   There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness, and I shall
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.200]   be walking in it.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.040]   This is my interest.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.240]   This is my concern.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.160]   Oh, much greater than my concern about the future of this country.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.360]   I am interested in that as a citizen, but this other is my concern.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.120]   Whatever may happen to this country or to any country, I am a citizen of heaven.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:46.720]   My citizenship is there, and I look forward to walking under the new heavens in the new
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:56.400]   earth wherein dwelleth righteousness and looking into the face of the Prince of Peace.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:58.500]   Amen.
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:05.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
