[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.540]   A number of years ago, Jack asked if he and Bill Bernstein could have an informal non-political
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:30.600]   chat as part of the agenda, and we all know that what Jack wants, Jack gets. So it's been
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.120]   so popular it's become a regular part of our conference agenda ever since, and it's now
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.200]   affectionately known as the Farside Chat. Jack's companion for this Farside Chat is
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.480]   a retired neurologist who helped co-found Efficient Frontier Advisors. He's written
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.360]   a number of bestselling titles on both finance and economic history. He holds both a Ph.D.
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:08.120]   in chemistry and an M.D. Please welcome one of the smartest guys I know, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.680]   Jack and Bill, since the Boglehead community is a politics-free group, we respectfully
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.920]   request that you honor and refrain from discussing anything political. Other than that, the floor
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.160]   is yours. Take it away, Bill. Okay. Well, thank you very much. I don't know
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:34.200]   who you're talking about. The first observation I would like to make is just to thank the
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.560]   moderators of the board. That's the main public forum of this organization. It's the one that
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.080]   almost certainly does the most public good among all the things that the Bogleheads do,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:59.320]   and I particularly want to thank the moderators. Susan "Lady Geek" Alex Fracht. Jim, who
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.240]   is prudent on the board. Thank you. Mel does. Mel moderates the board, too, because we all
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.480]   know what happens to boards very quickly when they are not moderated.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   I want to make an observation, Jack, which is there's a famous scene which repeats a
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:26.000]   bit of urban folklore from The Big Short. It's when one of the characters in the movie
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.520]   says to one of the others, "Don't gloat about your great success in predicting the crisis
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.080]   because for every $3 million that disappears from the economy, there's one excess death."
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.480]   This is going to kill a lot of people. It's going to hurt a lot of people as well. You
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.240]   quoted a figure, and that's something which is reasonably well accepted, I think, among
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.400]   epidemiologists and healthcare economists. You quoted that just in your most recent talk
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:09.320]   this morning, that Vanguard saves investors $2.5 trillion, or has $2.5 trillion in assets,
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.720]   so that if you do that computation, it's saving investors somewhere in the vicinity of $25
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.360]   billion a year. That's just in fees. You add transactional expenses on top of that. It's
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   maybe $40 billion in fees. If you do that division, $3 million a life, you're saving
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.280]   about 10,000 lives per year. I wondered if you would ever consider that. I'd add one
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.480]   other thing, which you're probably contributing to excess mortality, conversely, among active
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:53.400]   managers. I wonder if you've ever thought about that one.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.200]   Well, the answer is I have not thought about that. You can't think of everything. It's
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.600]   a good question. I didn't quite get the transition from dollars to lives.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   That's the regression slope of excess mortality on decrease in GDP. In other words, for every
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:19.600]   $3 million of GDP that's lost, there's one excess mortality in the population.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.160]   Got it.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.080]   As long as we're having fun with that, I thought I'd segue to something else. I don't think
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   this is political. There are certain things in the economy that are best run by the state.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.560]   Even if you're jumping up and down libertarian, you admit that defense and the courts and
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.720]   maybe even infrastructure fall within the purview of the state. Conversely, even if
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.920]   you're a socialist, you believe that the private sector should be producing most goods and
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.920]   services.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:05.160]   There's a third area of the economy, which is non-profits, which dominate, and rightfully
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.720]   so, certain parts of the economy. Education, for example. No one wants to go to San Diego
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:20.120]   University. Hospitals. Is there a doctor in this room who would want to be a patient in
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.680]   a for-profit hospital?
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.840]   Vanguard is a non-profit organization, for all practical purposes. What you demonstrated
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.480]   in your talk is it's slowly taking over the industry. Do you think that non-profit organizations
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.320]   like Vanguard, or maybe only Vanguard, maybe that finance is one area that should be run
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   by non-profits?
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:57.880]   Well, I wouldn't be in this for a dictate, a law, pass a law to do that because the issue
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.640]   is far too complicated for that. I do think that the one thing people don't quite understand
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.680]   about Vanguard, and mutual funds generally, is the reason you can mutualize is you need
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.080]   almost no capital. When we started Vanguard, I think our capital was maybe under a million
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.720]   dollars, maybe a million to two million dollars. The funds had plenty of money. I guess at
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.520]   that point, a billion and five in assets, but a couple of million dollars is just rounding
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:38.160]   error there. You really don't need to have as much capital as we had. You can rent computers,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.560]   you can rent land, you can rent buildings, and your ongoing cost, employee cost, usually
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.080]   about two-thirds of the cost, 65%, 75% of most businesses, you pay every month. That's
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.120]   not a capital item. You just have to have the revenues to support it. It works.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.960]   The more interesting question is, why don't more people do it? Why aren't? I've told people
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   often we started this Vanguard, we called it Vanguard, meaning the leader in a new trend
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:16.240]   back in 1974. Here we are, 43 years later, and we have yet to find our first follower.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.780]   How can you be a leader if you don't have any followers? It's a kind of existential
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:28.360]   question. The reason it's going to take-- so you don't need the capital. You can run
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:36.400]   a company this way. I don't want to go too far here, but it is mutual, truly mutual,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.000]   but there are no limits on the amount we can pay people. Our executives are very highly
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   paid. They don't want to disclose it even to me, but it's a different world than when
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.080]   we started all those years ago. There are certain reasons it should be very high and
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.620]   certain reasons maybe it is not, and it should not be. That's a kind of pressure that the
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:04.160]   typical nonprofit, National Constitution Center, let's say, doesn't face.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.440]   I would not pass a law, but at some point, competition has to rear its ugly head. It's
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.400]   amazing that at this stage of the industry's development, despite-- someone asked me yesterday,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:24.360]   maybe even last evening-- I think maybe you did last evening, Bill-- and asked me, how
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.720]   do these mutual fund companies survive with assets shrinking? The assets haven't shrunk
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.360]   at all because they've had net liquidations pretty much year after year for 12 years or
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.100]   so, more money going out than coming in, a lot more going out, but the market's been
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.440]   going up, and so the assets of mutual funds are actually larger. I'm quite sure about
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.000]   this. Larger than it was 12 years ago.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.400]   So a bull market is going to keep people from making the necessary changes. A bear market
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.600]   will make consumers much more sensitive to performance, much more sensitive to costs,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.760]   much more sensitive to the industry as a whole, even investing in stocks. That's what bad
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.640]   markets do. Very perverse. So I think it's going to gradually happen, and once it happens,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   it will be like a little rolling stone that gathers a lot of moss on the way down.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.840]   It sort of reminds-- sort of analogous to Warren Buffett's famous statement that you
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.320]   don't know who's been swimming naked until the tide goes out. All right. Well, let's
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:38.720]   talk segue to the composition of the market portfolio now. Everybody-- not people in this
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.080]   group, of course, but everybody else is talking about the FAANG stocks, F-A-A-N-G. What? Facebook,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:53.720]   Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google. And they're something on the order of what, 15 or 18 percent
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:02.440]   of market cap. Not unusual. If you look at market history for five or six stocks to the
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.120]   top five or six stops to occupy that much market cap. What is unusual is that they're
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.120]   all tech companies that are selling for high valuations. It's one thing when ExxonMobil
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.720]   and Procter & Gamble are the biggest stocks in the index. It's another when there are
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.040]   companies that could easily vaporize over the next 10 or 15 years. And I'm wondering
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.520]   if you have any thoughts about that. Well, of course, I've thought about it. And we've
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.360]   done a little research on it. It's not so easy to do. But the reality is that-- let
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:40.680]   me use your number-- 16 or 17 percent of the index fund's assets are in these tech stocks
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:47.560]   or market disruptive companies, whatever you want to call it. But the same amount, about
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:53.200]   16 or 17 percent, is in those stocks held by active managers. There's finally no way
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.840]   around this because you can't-- if a certain set of stocks or 17 percent of the industry
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.760]   and there's index funds that own, let's say, a third of it, and that the remaining two
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.440]   thirds of the assets have to be invested in the same stocks because they're there. I mean,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.680]   somebody has to own them. And we took it even a little bit further than that. Mike did some
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.960]   good work. Mike Nolan did some good work for me on this and tried to isolate out the mutual
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.640]   fund industry as compared to all other investors. And it turns out that the concentration is
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:29.200]   almost identical in the mutual fund field. So if the market goes to-- is this political,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.840]   Mel, if I ask what the market does? But if the market were to go way down, other funds
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.320]   will go down just like the index fund. Other funds as a group will go down just like the
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.600]   index funds do. There is a certain risk-- I'm editorializing a little bit here, Bill--
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.920]   a certain risk that with all this money coming into the index fund at very high prices, with
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.680]   people having an awful lot of shareholders, never having experienced a bear market, that
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.640]   the index fund could be hit more heavily with redemptions from disappointed investors. They
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.400]   shouldn't be because if they've been listening to me, all I did was ever promise them their
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.720]   fair share of market returns, good or bad. And sometimes I think they only hear good.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.840]   You know the way the world is. So it does not worry me. Maybe it should, but it does
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.880]   not.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:28.440]   OK. Let me ask another somewhat related question. I'm sure you're aware, Jack, of-- I think
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:35.720]   it's still a working paper, but it's gone viral by these three authors, Azar, Schmaltz,
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.920]   and Tessu. And for those of you who aren't familiar, the title of the article is The
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.040]   Anti-Competitive Effects of Corporate Ownership. And basically, one of the hints is that--
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:57.360]   or one of the propositions that these professors put forward is that mutual funds in general
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   and index funds in particular are bad for competition. The concentration of ownership
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.200]   means that they really don't care about how companies compete. In fact, the best thing
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:17.840]   is for them to collude to increase their profits. And this is bad for society in general because
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.520]   it distributes wealth away from consumers who are paying for the higher profits and
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.320]   towards the owners of capital. So I'm sure you've thought about it. And I thought I'd
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.800]   open it up for your comments.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.240]   Yeah, I have thought about it. And I actually-- like everything in my life, there's an anecdote
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:43.200]   about it. And the anecdote is that for a whole lot of reasons, one of the Pine Prize winner
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.240]   at Princeton, most outstanding student, young woman, was engaged to a young man. They were
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:52.280]   both graduating the same year. And he was the valedictorian. And when you get the Pine
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.000]   Prize winner married to the valedictorian, one wonders what that holds for the future
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.040]   generations. It's kind of awesome. And Glenn Weil is the valedictorian's name. And he is
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.320]   part of the group with Eric Posner and one other gal from Yale, Fiona somebody. I can't
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.960]   remember her last name offhand. And they are big in the same thing. They've written papers
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.800]   about it. They had an op-ed published in the Times. And the Times wouldn't publish my rebuttal.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:30.480]   But Eric got his Ph.D. in-- I'm sorry, Glenn got his Ph.D. five months after he graduated
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:37.440]   from Princeton. He's a little smarter than I am. And he is one of those-- we are having
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.800]   violent philosophical arguments about this. And the first thing is-- I mean, there are
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:51.000]   a number of levels of which I can respond to this on. One involves Pascal's wager, whether
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.780]   God exists or God does not exist. And the conclusion is-- you probably all know this.
[00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.760]   But the conclusion is, consequences must always outweigh probabilities. So they're saying,
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:09.000]   in effect, that the probabilities are that we're destroying Will's concentration of ownership.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.320]   We're limiting competition and reducing competition. And we ought to not be allowed to own more
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.560]   than one stock in a given industry. And they always use the airline industry as the example.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.440]   We probably own eight airline stocks. Let me take a guess. That would be all there are.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:35.320]   And so that's the only-- I mean, I wish they'd give us another example. But that argument
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.520]   ignores the fact that we would then have-- and I'm trying to get this number out of them.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.200]   And they can't give it to me, because they haven't done their work. And that is, how
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.760]   big would the S&P 500 fund-- how many stocks would it hold if you couldn't own any competing
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.460]   stocks? And they say, well, it's very difficult to do that, because we don't know what an
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:59.840]   industry is. What industry is Amazon in? Well, if you don't know that, what is the point
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.160]   of saying that you can only hold one stock in an industry? I mean, it just makes no sense
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:11.360]   at all. And it would destroy the index business, because you would have-- and that's the consequence
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.320]   of this possibility-- I hesitate to call it a probability-- the possibility there's an
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.260]   anti-competitive effect here, to destroy an industry.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.460]   Just think about the capital gains that funds would throw on their shareholders, for example,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.240]   if they had to divest all the companies in the industry but one. And then think about
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:38.600]   Vanguard buy bets on, let me say, Google. And Fidelity, in their index fund, decide
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:45.400]   not to bet on Google in that category, but to bet on, let's say, Apple. I'm not sure
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.200]   how-- these categories are not exact. So then Apple does better than Google. And so we got
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.080]   some people at Vanguard say, we've got to get out of this Google and into Apple. It's
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.760]   a managed fund. And that's the way it would work. So it would destroy a great idea. That's
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.280]   the number one thing. And is it worth it to do it for that? OK, that's one level.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.440]   And the second level is, what is happening about there? Where is this pressure, as it's
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.880]   generally stated, pressure on companies to reduce wages and increase prices coming from?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.640]   Well, first, it comes from a system where capitalism is trying to reward its owners.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   I'm not sure that's good, but it doesn't have anything to do with index funds as such. That's
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:37.120]   the way capitalism works. And the Glenn Weil, Eric Posner thing is really a socialist kind
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.760]   of thing. They don't like that. They don't want capitalism to work that way. And they
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.600]   think indexing is abetting it. And that may actually be. But we're not doing anything.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.240]   This is the point. And Vanguard, under Glenn Borum, has about, I think, 40 analysts who
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.960]   look at corporate proxies and that kind of thing. And a little postscript here, we put
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.880]   out a lovely booklet on full disclosure, which I've been asking for for years, of exactly
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.320]   how we do our proxy voting every year. Just came out. You should go to our website, all
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.960]   of you, or any of you that are interested, and see how we do the voting. But it doesn't
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.880]   have anything to do with calling the head of United Airlines or American Airlines and
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.840]   saying, you know, we really want you to raise your prices and to reduce your wages. We don't
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.000]   get into that with these companies.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.680]   The essence of governance, from an index point of view, is to make sure that the company
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:34.240]   is run in the interest of shareholders. And if that means some bad things for the system,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.200]   you know, favoring capital against income, well, that's the way capitalism has worked
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.520]   forever. And, you know, I don't need to defend capitalism. Everybody knows these two things
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.880]   about it. It's the best economic system, the best system for allocating resources ever
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.680]   designed, and it distributes those benefits very, very disproportionately. And that's
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.600]   why we have this large gap between the wealthiest one-tenth of one percent or even one-hundredth
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:06.560]   of one percent. It's kind of scary. And the rest of the people and the rest of the owners
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.480]   and the rest of the income earners in the country.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.440]   So there are a lot of repairs we need, but none of them have anything to do with changing
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:24.440]   the S&P 500 into the S&P 411 or 382. They won't give me the answer. Someday they're
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.760]   going to find it. They claim they can figure it out. But if they can't even adequately
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:34.880]   define industry, how are they going to answer my question? But this is not a specious attack.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:41.080]   This is an attack that can be regarded as possibly even winning, because the Clayton
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:49.480]   Act, 1914, is designed to protect competition. And even the suspicion of anti-competitive
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.720]   actions or structures puts the burden on you to prove that you're not doing it, and
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.840]   not on the government to prove you're doing it.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.120]   So it's complicated. It is threatening. I've been -- I don't know how this exactly
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.400]   happened, but I've been kind of the lead person at Vanguard, even though I'm not
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.960]   technically in Vanguard, on responding to these authors. And we're going to have
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:22.920]   at it. And one more good fight. Get the blood boiling and the heart pounding. I love it.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.680]   But it is a real threat.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:30.480]   To which I would add that the data are very fragmentary, that we really only looked at
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:37.120]   one industry, which, as you point out, is the airline industry. And also, I just don't
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:47.120]   imagine how, you know, the managers of Vanguard's and BlackRock's index funds get together with
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.320]   the leaders in all these industries and say, "Hey, why don't you guys get together
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.560]   and just have a quiet little chat about pricing and labor costs so that, you know, you can
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:03.960]   collude against consumers?" It just doesn't make sense. It reeks of a certain amount of
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   paranoia, I think.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:13.800]   Let me add, if I may, Bill, one editorial thing. And that is, when you get big and successful,
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.960]   there are going to be a lot of problems that are raised in the competitive markets and
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.880]   by governments all over the world, not just the U.S., because the ETFs and so on are growing
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:30.120]   every bit as fast outside of the U.S. TIFs, not at all. TIF means traditional index funds,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.360]   have you all got that yet?
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:38.040]   So those threats are going to be there when you get large. It's inevitable. And there
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.480]   will be tough threats. I mean, it's pretty clear that there's an oligopoly, I mentioned
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.960]   that in my remarks earlier, between, among Vanguard, number one, BlackRock, number two,
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.880]   State Street, week number three. But that's about it. And you can't really see somebody
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.640]   else coming into the business to try and tackle that oligopoly.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   We have, I guess, $4 trillion technically, or $3 trillion technically indexed, purely
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:14.520]   indexed assets. And BlackRock probably has $2 trillion. Well, outside of their ETFs,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:25.640]   they have more assets than we do. And so we compete, but other people can never ascribe
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.600]   or achieve those economies of scale that those three firms have been able to do.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.940]   State Street's a little bit different issue, because it's almost all institutional kind
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:42.040]   of business. One institution betting, trading with another. What a great business. I don't
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:51.840]   even care for it, but then it seems useless. So you get that threat. You get governmental
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.760]   threat. You get competitive threat. But nobody wants to jump into the water, because they
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.160]   would have to spend years and millions of dollars in losses to get anything like the
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.360]   economies of scale that we deliver to investors. But if you deliver them to investors, you're
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:11.680]   not delivering them to managers. This is a very perverse business. It's really run, to
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.720]   be blunt about it, run more for the managers than for the shareholders. And so that's what
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.920]   makes our stock and trade so high.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:26.160]   Yeah. I mean, again, without trying to get Mel to break into a sweat here, Thomas Piketty,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:34.600]   when he wrote Capital in the 21st Century about inequality, missed really one essential
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.120]   point, which is that if you look at how income inequality has grown in the United States,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:47.160]   70% of its growth has been basically compensation to corporate managers. That's really where
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:54.960]   it's all coming from. And you could say that corporate managers are basically looting the
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.200]   system, but I don't want to get into that too much.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:08.160]   All right. Well, there's a school of thought, Jack, that says that persistently and artificially
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:19.760]   low interest rates, very expansive Fed policy, has contributed to the slowdown in economic
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.040]   growth and has also made the system more unstable. It's slowed down economic growth because it
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.600]   misallocates capital. When interest rates are so low, people put it into unproductive
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:37.520]   projects, particularly real estate, which is not at all productive and away from things
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.700]   that are productive. So not only does it slow down the economy, but by inflating asset class
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:50.840]   bubbles and producing very high asset class prices, it also makes the system more unstable
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.200]   as well. It's the classic Austrian point of view. And I'm wondering if that worries you
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   at all.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:05.960]   Well, honestly, only to the extent that everything worries me. And when you get into totally
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:12.300]   uncharted waters, where we are on interest rates and the Fed balance sheet, I think predicting
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.920]   is that-- I wouldn't know who to lean on to say, tell me what's going to happen and have
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.600]   any confidence in their answers. Nobody has been in this situation before. A lot depends
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.440]   on how quickly they take that balance sheet down. I think the Fed balance sheet went from
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:31.320]   around a trillion to around $4 or $5 trillion, something like that. And no one knows the
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.520]   impact of it coming back down. Then you've got the fact that China owns, I think, 26%
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.720]   of-- or 16%, maybe, a very large portion-- don't hold me to the number-- of US treasuries.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.440]   And if they were ever to sell, those rates would go up so quickly you couldn't even find
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:48.440]   it.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:56.720]   So just honestly, for me-- and I'm not the brightest bulb in the ground-- unpredictable.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   And you kind of hope that we will muddle through. And we've muddled through before, because
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.600]   the system works in a supply and demand sense. It usually works pretty well. Whether it will
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.440]   in this case, I don't know. But of course, it worries me.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:17.640]   For those of you who aren't familiar with the name Hyman-Minsky, he produced the instability
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:24.040]   hypothesis that basically says that stability produces instability, and instability produces
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.080]   stability. And you go around and around in these cycles that last about 10 years or so.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:38.280]   And the moment when it all falls apart is called the Minsky moment, September 15, 2008.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:46.040]   There was a rather very important person who used that phrase this morning, and that was
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:53.520]   the head of the Chinese Central Bank. It was just something I picked up from the headlines.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:00.680]   All right. Well, let's shift gears again. You have that graph, one of the graphs you
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.040]   showed, that just points ever, ever upward, the percentage of assets that are actively
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:15.080]   managed. So my wife keeps telling me I either need new jokes or new audience. And so I think
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.200]   I have kind of a new audience here. So I'll ask a question which I've asked you in pretty
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   much the same form every year, and maybe put a little bit of editorializing on it too before
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:31.680]   I ask it, which is that it is said that if too many people index, that active managers
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.360]   will succeed. But we both know that can't possibly be true, because even if 99 percent
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.320]   of assets are indexed, that 1 percent that is left for active managers to invest in is
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:48.480]   still the market. And they're going to get the market return minus their expenses. But
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:56.720]   some weird stuff is going to happen if we get to that point. So the question is threefold.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:04.760]   One, will it happen? Two, at what point does it happen? And three, if it does happen, what
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:13.280]   weird stuff is going to happen? Do I have to answer all three? Not necessarily. You
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.120]   can cut it short by saying it'll never happen, and then I've got to go on to the next question.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.520]   When you get to 99 percent or something like that, God knows what would happen. I mean,
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.880]   that's so close to 100 percent that I'm not sure the market would, in fact, function very
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.760]   well. But would it function well at 50 percent? Indexing is now said to be, you know, it's
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:36.440]   41 percent of the mutual fund business. But overall in the U.S., at least, it's probably,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.520]   say, 26, 27 percent. Well, it's got a long way to go, and a precipitous kind of ride
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.920]   up and down. And a bear market would slow down indexing, whether it would slow down
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.800]   other people by a greater amount. We just don't know, given the fact, as I mentioned,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.400]   that a lot of money is coming into the index funds at a high level. And so I don't worry
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.560]   about it. It's going to take a long, there'll be diminishing returns. You know, if indexing
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:10.020]   has gone from 20 percent to 40 percent in the mutual fund industry, to go to 80 percent
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:19.520]   would require, you know, I guess 100 years or something like that, to me, anyway. So
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:28.880]   indexing will continue to do okay. But there are other challenges, in particular, the money
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.720]   coming in at a high point, which I mentioned. And then I want to get to your third point,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:38.560]   but I can't remember it. What weird stuff happens if we ever get there? Okay, well,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.800]   that gives me a chance to comment on one of the great canards of all this. And the active
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:48.200]   managers say, or their representatives say, if all these people are indexing, the market
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:55.600]   will be less efficient and it'll be easier for managers to win. Well, of course it will.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.380]   No argument about that. The less efficient the market, the easier it is for managers
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:07.760]   to systematically win. Which managers, I don't know. But it's also easier by the same amount
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:14.120]   for active managers to lose. Because you can't have all the active managers winning when
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.480]   they own, as a group, the index. So it'll be easier to lose and easier to win. What
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:27.120]   else is new? So I don't worry about the market becoming so efficient that a certain cadre
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:32.040]   of active managers will start to outperform for the first time. They're really locked
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:38.200]   into a system. There's something that very little, if anything, has been written about.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.400]   But the industry is totally dominated by very, very big firms. I think more so than in the
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:48.240]   past. I don't see a reason why a little money manager in Minnesota or something can't do
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.600]   perfectly well in this system. He probably can't beat the market. But he can keep a business
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:31:01.720]   going and be happy in good markets. And so the dominance of the big managers means they're
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.800]   really at their peril in getting into indexing. Because they're looking for the big profit
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:13.400]   stream. And the simple fact of the matter is that the easy entry into the index market
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:24.080]   is the ETF. I don't know when the last traditional index fund was started. Maybe it was 1974.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.480]   But that was a very slow thing at the beginning. And now ETFs just come and go at a rapid rate.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.360]   But that's the means of entry. So that's good if you're distributing your shares through
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:44.200]   stockbrokers. Because the great thing-- I'll put great in quotation marks with a big question
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.320]   mark next to it-- is the way to do distribution through broker-dealers. And I got out of that
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.920]   system deliberately in 1977 when we went no load. But we're now much bigger in the broker-dealer
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.240]   system than we ever were then in terms of the percentage of our assets that are distributed
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:11.520]   by brokers. So anything that gives the middleman strength-- the broker's strength in this case--
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.760]   costs money. And anything that involves more trading costs money. And trading is the investor's
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:22.080]   enemy. Because all these traders together get the market return, unless the cost-- none
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:29.720]   of it is very complicated. So I don't see a real challenge from within the industry.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:36.860]   Because I think the ETF is a step too far. And the TIF is just an awkward way to get
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:44.120]   into the business. Let alone, in your own internal frame philosophy in your firm, you've
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:50.440]   been condemning indexing for all these years. And now you say we're going to do this.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:57.020]   I'll tell you a little anecdote if I have a minute here. And that is, I was walking
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:03.680]   out in the hall one afternoon at Vanguard. And there was a man, not Vanguard person,
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.720]   looking around like this. And I said, can I give you a hand? Are you looking for something?
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.440]   He said, yeah, I'm looking for the men's room. And I said, it's right over there. There's
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.720]   a great big sign that says men. So I said, this guy may not be the brightest bulb either.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:24.620]   And I said, what brings you down here? And he said, well, I'm marketing the Eaton Howard,
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:31.120]   I guess it is. Is Eaton Howard that has this new way of trading funds? Eaton Vance. Eaton
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:36.400]   Vance. I'm back in the old name. And they have a way of trying to compete with regular
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.080]   mutual funds, but have them traded in the stock market. One of the worst ideas ever
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:49.240]   in going nowhere. Is that called Next? Next? Next Shares. So he said, I'm down here. Well,
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.400]   I said, I don't run this place, but I don't think we're going to be very interested. And
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:02.680]   I said, what did you do before that? He said, oh, I was the marketing manager for the index
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:13.960]   funds at Fidelity. And I said, well, at least you made a step up.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.880]   Thank you, Jack and Bill. It's time for a break, and we'll take 20 minutes and come
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.400]   right back.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
