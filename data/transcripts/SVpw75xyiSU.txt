[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.560]   Welcome everyone to Bogle Heads on Investing episode number 44.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.920]   Today, our special guest is Eric Balchunis,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840]   senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.960]   Eric recently wrote a book, The Bogle Effect, how John Bogle and
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.600]   Vanguard turned Wall Street inside out and saved investors trillions.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.880]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.160]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry and I'm the host of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.600]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.840]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.280]   a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.160]   Today, our special guest is Eric Balchunis,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280]   senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.400]   Eric was my guest on episode number 15 where we talked about his former book,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400]   The Institutional ETF Toolbox.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.120]   This time, we're talking about a new book, The Bogle Effect.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.280]   And what exactly is The Bogle Effect?
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.080]   It's not just Jack Bogle's life, it's not just Vanguard, but
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.040]   it's the influence that he had on an entire industry.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.800]   In fact, the entire world.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.920]   You can pre-order today and it will be published on April 26th.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.600]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Eric Balchunis.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.560]   Welcome again to the Bogle Heads on Investing podcast, Eric.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560]   >> It's great to be here, Rick.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.480]   I'm a big fan of the podcast and all the work you do.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.280]   >> Well, last time you were here was episode number 15, so
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.640]   it was a couple of years ago.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.840]   Back then, we were talking about your previous book,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.880]   The Institutional ETF Handbook.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.840]   And this time, we're gonna be talking about your new book, The Bogle Effect.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.720]   How Jack Bogle and Vanguard turned Wall Street inside out and
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.160]   saved investors trillions.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.560]   And I have to say, you've done a wonderful job with this book.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.880]   But before we jump into that, I mean,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.160]   your job at Bloomberg is the senior ETF analyst.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.920]   And as we both know, Jack Bogle thought that ETFs were a product of the devil.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.240]   So what is an ETF analyst doing writing a book about Jack Bogle?
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.840]   >> Well, it's a good question, Rick, because Bogle was very animated and
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   colorful in his critique of ETFs over the years.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.080]   I know because I went to interview him multiple times and
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.360]   challenged him on this and asked him questions about ETFs.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.620]   But my first time really sitting down and interviewing him came in about 2013-ish.
[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.440]   And I was writing a book on ETFs, which you mentioned.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.680]   And I wanted to get his take on them, some of the trends going on,
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.160]   like smart beta, I wanted to include him in the book.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.960]   I write my books like semi-documentaries, and I like a lot of voices in there
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.440]   to give the topics more angles and color.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   And I thought Bogle on ETFs would be a way to get the green vegetables, so
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.520]   I don't get too carried away with ETFs.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.800]   Let's get the grandfather Puritan voice in here to maybe give the other side
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.160]   of the ETF story.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.300]   And he was critical, and I put some of his criticisms in my first book.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.240]   But I kept pushing back, and at the end of the day,
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.360]   I think his problem was trading and marketing.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.640]   That said, there's plenty of ETFs that aren't really full of gimmicky marketing,
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.040]   and that are not traded that much.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580]   And so he did admit that and acknowledge that over the years.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.280]   But that was ultimately his issue.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.400]   And I have a chapter in the book called Bogle and ETFs, it's complicated.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.360]   One of the reasons I wrote this book as an ETF analyst is that I was shocked,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.040]   and it always stuck with me when I interviewed Steve Bloom,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.160]   who created the first ETF with Nate Most at the American Stock Exchange.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.480]   He told me the story of going to Bogle's office, talking to him about ETFs,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.040]   Bogle giving him some advice, but saying,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.040]   you're never going to use the Vanguard fund for this.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.160]   But he was nice, and one thing he said was, well,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.000]   we priced the first ETF, SPY, at 20 basis points of a fee.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.920]   And just for clarification, SPY is?
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   The SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the first ETF launched in the US.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.400]   It's the biggest to this day.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.800]   It's basically king of the ETF world.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   And it was the first one launched, and it had a price point of 20 basis points.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   And why did they do that?
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.440]   And he said, because Vanguard's 500 index mutual fund was 20 basis
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.120]   points at the time, which is pretty cheap, especially in the '90s.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.720]   This is absolutely major, and it really dawned on me
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.600]   that the ETF industry would be a tiny fraction of itself
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   had Vanguard and the mutual ownership structure
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.640]   not gotten to 20 basis points at that point.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.720]   These are guys from the American Stock Exchange.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.760]   They weren't exactly like retail people.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.920]   We know Wall Street.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.840]   They probably would have priced it at 80 or 90,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.680]   because that's just what you can get away with back then until Vanguard
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.480]   hit the scene.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.440]   And that is huge, because if you start to think about that,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.800]   you realize that the ETF industry is almost largely built off
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.480]   of retail and advisors at this point.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.520]   And there's no way they're buying an ETF at 80, 90 basis points.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.320]   Maybe a couple.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   Maybe at the fringes, it would have some assets.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.560]   But I just think that was an interesting link and something
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   where I thought, wow, Bogle had this profound effect on something
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   that he hated.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.400]   And then as I researched this book, I realized over and over this
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.640]   was the case.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.320]   I get what you're saying exactly.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.480]   And I really love the title of the book, The Bogle Effect,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.800]   because what you just described was part of the Bogle effect, which
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.360]   was that even though Vanguard didn't create ETFs and Jack hated ETFs,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.400]   that he had such a profound influence right
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   at the beginning in the ETF marketplace.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.640]   And this perpetuates through many, many things
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.600]   that we're going to talk about here on this podcast.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   It's not just index investing.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.720]   It's the whole entire industry, and not only in the US,
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.360]   but now around the world.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.000]   And so the Bogle effect is just growing in many different directions.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.240]   So I think it's a great title.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   The book, which I found fascinating-- of course, I'm a Bogle head,
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.840]   and I read all this stuff, kind of a geek, if you will.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.440]   And thanks for mentioning me a few times in the book as well.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.000]   I appreciate that.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.280]   You've done a great job describing who Jack Bogle really was.
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.960]   People used to call him Saint Jack, right?
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.160]   As soon as he had this idea about indexing, his world changed,
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.120]   and he was all about indexing and so forth.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.640]   But that's not really true.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.720]   And I think that you brought that out of the book,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.480]   and I think it's interesting.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.080]   So this is sort of the true story of Jack Bogle and Vanguard
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.200]   and the rise of Bogle-ism, if you will.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.920]   Bogle was an investor activist most of the time during his life,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.840]   although not all of the time.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.800]   And so let's start with Jack Bogle, the beginning.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   And the fact is, he was an active investor.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.080]   Yeah, so he ran Wellington, which was a balanced fund.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.760]   The big Wellington fund was balanced, and it was active.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.800]   And I think, had a crisis not emerged at Wellington,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.440]   I believe he would have stayed there.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.280]   He was happy there, but fate intervened.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.320]   And what was interesting is, he had this balanced fund,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.640]   and everybody can identify with it because it's just like this era.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.840]   The last 10 years, you know how growth stocks have gone wild.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.680]   They've sold off a little this year, but for the last 10 years,
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.920]   if you're a value investor or doing anything conservative,
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.440]   you've probably had a tough time in the past decade.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.800]   And so it was a similar situation where there were funds like ARK
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.360]   just going wild and basically capturing and riding this wave.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.640]   And his Wellington fund was conservative, and it wasn't going well.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.160]   They were losing customers and assets and clients.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.840]   And his boss, Walter Morgan, said, okay, look,
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   I'm going to hand the firm over to you at age 35.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.720]   I need you to fix it.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.120]   So he said, look, I was selling bagels, and everybody wanted donuts
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.080]   across the street, so I thought we should start selling donuts.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.560]   And it was a great metaphor because donuts are sweet and just like,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.680]   you know, high performing funds are in a similar way sweet,
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   but maybe not good for you.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.320]   And so he looked to try to team up with an equity company
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.680]   that was good at equities.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.880]   And he went through like four or five people.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.680]   And I actually think he brought this up on your podcast.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.160]   I think he was on the first one, I'm sure, right?
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.680]   Yeah, he was my first guest.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.040]   He said he went to Capital Group.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   They weren't interested.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.880]   He goes to Franklin. They weren't interested.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.960]   And ultimately, he lands at Thorndike, which had this iVest fund.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.280]   And it was a real popular fund.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.680]   And so it wasn't his first choice.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.880]   These were like his fourth or fifth choice.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.880]   And they were really polar opposites.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.360]   And for a while, it worked.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   It was like they had gotten chocolate to match with the peanut butter.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.520]   It seemed good.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.440]   But then the market basically dropped after the '60s were over in the early '70s.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.160]   It fell, I believe it was 35% in two years.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:21.160]   And basically, they had changed the Wellington Fund to be almost all equities.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.760]   And so the Wellington Fund went down as much as the market.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.040]   Just rewinding the story a little bit.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   So during this period of time, the go-go years of the late 1960s,
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   you had companies like Xerox and Polaroid, IBM, Avon, Extron.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.600]   I remember all the Tron stocks, actually.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.440]   These are the Facebooks and the Googles of the day, if you will.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.960]   These were the Teslas of their day.
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.680]   And they were not in it at Wellington.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.840]   And so they were trailing far behind the rest of the market and losing assets.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.800]   But then when they brought in these other managers
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.760]   and they did load up Wellington with these stocks,
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.480]   unfortunately, if you are a Wellington investor,
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.240]   you not only did not keep up with the market during the '60s,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.560]   but now you had all these other stocks.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.480]   It's like buying ARK at the peak and then boom, down it comes.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.360]   And you lost 40% when these stocks dropped.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   So you didn't get any of the upside.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.560]   You got very little of the upside and you got all the downs.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.680]   He must have been in some really deep trouble.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.480]   Yeah, I imagine he felt he betrayed his boss, his mentor, and himself.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.800]   And he was pissed off.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.760]   And apparently, he was no picnic to deal with either.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.120]   I can't say-- in his books, he sort of writes himself as the victim.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.800]   And I guess there's some of that.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   Although he admits, I made a mistake hiring these guys or merging with them.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.320]   And he gave them effective operating control of the board
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.840]   or voting control of the board.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800]   He gave away too much in the deal.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.160]   Anyway, they had voting control of the board.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.280]   And they were not into him.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.320]   And they fired him.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.120]   But then he realized that he was actually
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.200]   chairman of the funds themselves.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   Yeah, do explain that.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.040]   Explain that a little bit.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.360]   Yeah, it's a quirk in the system.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   Wellington's the investment advisor.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.000]   And the funds are like shell companies themselves.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.480]   So they hire out an administrator, an advisor.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.080]   And so there's the board of the company, Wellington.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.800]   And there's the board of each fund.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.760]   And so Jack was chairman of the funds.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.680]   And so he had some power.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.240]   They didn't realize this.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.600]   And so he decided to basically dig in and, as chairman of the funds,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:34.360]   sort of fight to keep control of something versus Wellington the company.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.080]   And it was actually a pretty brilliant move.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.320]   He's basically starting a young family at this point.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.200]   The pressure's on.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.480]   So he had a lot going on.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.000]   But he's a fighter.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.680]   I mean, this guy is--
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.400]   he's not going to just go away.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.360]   You tell the story in the book how he used to play squash.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.960]   And he had a heart condition.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.760]   And so he used to bring a defibrillator to the court.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.800]   And he would tell his opponent that if he passed out,
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.240]   run and get the defibrillator and shock him back.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   Which I would assume he would continue to play at that point.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   I mean, this is the kind of person he was.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.440]   Yeah, I mean, this guy was hardcore.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.480]   And especially the issue with his heart.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.720]   He was supposed to die like 10 times.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.600]   He was told he wasn't going to live past 35, 40.
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.680]   I think being that close to death all the time
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.120]   probably gave him a jolt of life in a fight
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.320]   that maybe other people don't have.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.120]   And it may be a sense of purpose.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.640]   So back to the bifurcation period, you
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.000]   have Bogle on one side and the Thorndike guys on the other.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.440]   Bogle and the board, and they all say, look,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.080]   we have a mess on our hands.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.680]   Bogle, why don't you come up with a way
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.840]   to basically come up with a solution in which your funds
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.240]   can live in harmony with Wellington the company?
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.480]   So Bogle and his two assistants, Jan Twardowski in particular,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.280]   it seems like a scene from Jerry Maguire.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.600]   They crammed and wrote this 250-page report
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.320]   with a couple solutions.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.840]   They needed some kind of a solution
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.360]   where they could just work together
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.040]   even though they hated each other.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.440]   And so the board of the funds, which actually had,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.320]   I think, three people from the Thorndike crew,
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.920]   and I think seven or eight from the Philadelphia-Wellington
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.980]   side that were more friendly to Jack.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.480]   But still, there were three on there from the Thorndike side.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.440]   So they needed something, and the board
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.480]   wanted it to be unanimous.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.320]   So basically, Jack had to propose something
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.900]   that would make it seem like he wasn't
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.600]   going to make out like a bandit or impose too much control
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.720]   and also mess with Wellington or Thorndike's desire
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.760]   to run money.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.000]   So the solution was, you become a back office administrator
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.040]   for the funds, and we'll mutualize.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.600]   Therefore, it doesn't look like I'm
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.120]   in this for money or anything.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.600]   And so that's sort of how he was able to get
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.920]   the unanimous approval of the board and keep his job.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.960]   And then he took about 25, 30 people with him,
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.680]   and he decided to call that company Vanguard.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.920]   And just to clarify, you say back office administration.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.200]   I mean, what does that cover?
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.620]   Basically, all the funds have holdings,
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.920]   and you have to calculate what the value is every day.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.400]   Basically, all the operational details
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.200]   that go into sending out the NAV, the numbers,
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.160]   keeping track of it, probably working with the custodian.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.440]   Basically, all the not fun stuff,
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.600]   Wellington, the company that Thorndike was now running,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.440]   they would still be the investment advisor.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.520]   So they would run the money and do the investments,
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.520]   which is what they liked anyway.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.480]   So the back office is an unsung job.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.640]   It's necessary for any fund to operate.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.240]   But I mean, I think most people would find
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.840]   accounting and administrative tasks pretty boring.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.920]   So they went ahead and went with that.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.000]   So Vanguard got started.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.660]   It was kind of a non-event, if you will.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.160]   The media didn't really even pick it up.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.200]   It was not a big deal.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.160]   It was just, okay, Wellington is gonna offload
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   this back office administrative stuff
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.800]   to this new entity that they formed.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.440]   It's not a profit center, if you will.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.920]   It's just at cost.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.120]   And it's called Vanguard.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   I mean, it probably didn't even make the last page
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.240]   of the Wall Street Journal at the time.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.200]   That's right.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.700]   And that was a way to sell it to the Thorndike side,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.160]   because they thought, okay, fine, you do the back office.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.000]   We'll run money.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.200]   That's what we're good at anyway.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.480]   That's what we wanna do.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.980]   And we can now move forward together,
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.800]   even though we're not friends.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.040]   And that was the deal they made.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.280]   But then something happened, right?
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.480]   How did they end up starting the S&P 500 fund
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.280]   if they can't run money?
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.800]   Yeah, again, and the serendipity in that story
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.740]   is ridiculous, right?
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.600]   Like the amount of things that had to happen
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.200]   just for Vanguard, the mutual to be born were crazy.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.560]   Then for Vanguard to launch an index fund,
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.200]   it was also a crazy serendipitous situation
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.240]   because you read an article by Paul Samuelson
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.520]   right after he started Vanguard.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.880]   So good timing.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.480]   And Paul Samuelson was saying,
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.800]   someone should just set up an index fund
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.560]   just so we can benchmark
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.080]   all these gunslinging active managers
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.920]   and see what they're really worth.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.160]   Also Burton Malkiel, who was talking about
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.920]   if there isn't an S&P 500 index fund, there should be.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240]   And that was quoted in his
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.440]   "Random Walk Down Wall Street" book,
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.120]   which was published in 1973.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.360]   And there were some other people as well,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.360]   like Charles Ellis and other folks
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   who were alluding to the fact
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.380]   that there should be index funds.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.240]   And Bogle just like, you know what?
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.120]   I'll do it.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.680]   And that, I won't be running money.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.360]   We can actually try to sell it to our board
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.000]   by saying this isn't running money 'cause it's passive.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.560]   So he actually got it through,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.040]   as he says later in the interview,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.240]   they actually bought it.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.720]   'Cause even, I think he thought,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   well, this is a real,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.560]   this is a big technicality
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   I'm trying to drive a truck through.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.040]   But he got it through.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.200]   And that was a way for him to sort of follow.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.040]   He liked the idea.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.520]   He saw the returns were pretty good
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.920]   versus the group of active funds.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.120]   The data was there.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.960]   Paul Samuelson buying in helped him a lot
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.560]   because he has academic credentials.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.000]   Like I work for Kennedy.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.840]   And so Bogle was able to get that idea through the board.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.080]   And then they filed for the first,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.680]   I think it was called the first investment trust.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.160]   It wasn't Vanguard at first.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.240]   And then that was in, I believe '75.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.840]   In fact, there were attempts at doing index funds
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.920]   in the early '70s before Vanguard
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   through Wells Fargo and Battery March Financial
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.240]   and American National Bank in Chicago.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.520]   So there were other attempts at this.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.120]   This is, if you will, not Jack Bogle's idea, correct?
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.320]   No, I don't think it was.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.680]   And I don't think anybody would debate that.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.520]   And in the book,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.000]   I have a small section called the origins of indexing.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.280]   And I go back to MIT, Chicago,
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.160]   John Mack McGowan, who worked at Wells Fargo.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.800]   It kind of reminded me of the PC and Steve Jobs.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.960]   Steve Jobs did not invent the PC or personal computing,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.680]   but in every business,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.600]   there's usually somebody who's able to bring it to the masses
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.800]   and that's a whole different ballgame.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.920]   The other thing is,
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.080]   even though people could have an ideal idea of this
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.400]   and think about it and buying the S&P,
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.520]   it's a different story when you have to sell it
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.720]   to your big boss at the bank or whatever.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.520]   Well, I'm not gonna sell a fund for three basis points
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.680]   or whatever, 20.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.160]   They wanna make money.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.800]   And so to me, again,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.040]   this brought me back to why I really focused on Bogle
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.280]   because none of this really happens to any extent
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.760]   like it has happened without it, the mutual structure.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.480]   And that structure is why indexing is popular.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   It was because it's cheap.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.720]   The index just happened to be the perfect vehicle
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.760]   for the mutual ownership structure
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.000]   and an idea whose time was ready.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.160]   So Bogle was in the right place, right time.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.680]   And the index fund was.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.160]   Honestly, I actually have this statement in the book,
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.400]   which is that indexing and index funds needed Vanguard
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.720]   more than Vanguard needed index funds,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.040]   if that makes any sense.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.600]   Yeah, it was the structure of Vanguard
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.520]   and the nonprofit nature of it,
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.520]   which allowed this to eventually grow.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.640]   Although it didn't at first, right?
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.320]   I mean, the mistake that was made
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.040]   was they tried to raise their initial capital
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.440]   through the brokerage industry.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.160]   And that did not go well.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.400]   No, there were stories about them going out
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.240]   and the pitch they used was,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.280]   "Well, what if I could tell you
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.720]   "you could go out in a golf course and shoot par?
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.880]   "Would you lock into par?"
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.240]   And they said that played okay,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.680]   but basically they wouldn't pay brokers.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.320]   That was problem number one.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.040]   And number two is it really is a hard concept to understand.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.120]   It's counterintuitive to think that
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.800]   just buying all the stocks in a market cap weight
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.160]   would actually be good.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.200]   So I spend a good chunk of the chapter on the index fund,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.000]   not essentially on why indexing makes sense or doesn't,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.920]   but just how Bogle sold it.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.360]   And he had to sell it outside of the system,
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   which makes it even harder.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.960]   It's like making a movie
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.600]   and no cable channel will carry you.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.480]   No movie theater will carry you.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.080]   You basically have to sell it outside of the entire system.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.480]   And it took a long time because of that.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   And it took a long time
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.120]   because of the counterintuitive nature of it.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.720]   So he was very creative.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.800]   I think some of the ways he did it
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.080]   was to show the growth of $10,000.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.000]   If you get 5% versus 7%.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But he had to take that direct to the public.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.680]   And so the idea of going through the brokerage industry
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.960]   to raise capital, like they were,
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.000]   according to Jack Bogle,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.880]   they were trying to raise 150 million.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.640]   That's what he said in my interview
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.280]   before they launched this fund,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.600]   which ultimately did launch in 1976.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.160]   But they ended up only raising
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.000]   through the brokerage industry, $11 million.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.760]   In fact, in my interview with Jack,
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.720]   you should not even launch the fund
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.200]   if all you have is 11 million.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.320]   I mean, it should never have existed.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.560]   Yeah, you know, it gives the story some drama
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.880]   because here you have this flop.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.600]   Everybody knows it's a big deal today, but it flopped.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.400]   And so, but you have to put yourself in the time and place
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.320]   and wonder, would you have kept it going?
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.160]   Plus, keep in mind,
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.000]   they launched it when Wellington, again,
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.800]   those funds were within an 80 month streak of outflows.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.400]   It was just a brutal time, but they hung in there.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.240]   I think he just believed in the idea.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.240]   It took Vanguard 25 years to even get 10% market share.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.280]   That is a long time.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.520]   And if you look at a chart
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.640]   of all the people who ran Vanguard,
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.280]   Jack's time is the line of assets
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.040]   is all the way at the bottom for his whole tenor.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.640]   It only starts to go up after he passed it off.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.360]   But that groundwork was so major.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.880]   And the blood, sweat, and tears of hanging in there.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.720]   And if you read his book, "Character Counts,"
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.120]   it's all his speeches from like speech in '81, '82.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.960]   It's like the Christmas party speeches.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.160]   And each one, he's like, "Hey, we got to 3 billion.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.040]   "Can you believe it?"
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.560]   And every billion is like this huge victory.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.040]   Now they've taken a billion, over a billion a day.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   It's wild.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.720]   Interesting you say that
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.840]   because the Vanguard S&P 500 is going back
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.840]   to the story of the Vanguard S&P 500.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.880]   The first investor trust being launched in 1976
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.680]   and with only 11 million.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.600]   They couldn't even buy 500 stocks.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.120]   They could only buy about 275 stocks.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.440]   And another thing was,
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.280]   and I had asked him this on my podcast
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.900]   and I really was mind blowing,
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.840]   is that the first fund manager,
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.680]   the one who did the trading in that account
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   was one of his assistants who was run part-time,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.920]   this is his quote,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.760]   by a young woman whose full-time job
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.400]   was to work with her husband
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.840]   at her husband's furniture store in Wilmington, Delaware.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.160]   I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.360]   Yeah, I remember my second time I interviewed Jack
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.720]   and when he told me that story, I almost fell over.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.600]   I was like, "Really?"
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.480]   It speaks to the sort of small business,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.960]   upstart kind of atmosphere that was happening at the time
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.760]   and how, again, big ideas sometimes seem
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.040]   so not a big idea at the time.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.400]   You make a good point.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.320]   By not having all the stocks and having a high fee,
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.280]   I think it launched in like 45, 50 basis points.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.720]   The tracking was pretty bad.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.200]   I think it might've missed the index by 60, 70 basis points,
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.120]   which today would be like a horror show.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.120]   If you look at a chart, over time,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.160]   the fee came down and the tracking got better.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.760]   They brought in Gus Sauter to really sort of
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.680]   bring his math skills in and his ability to trade
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.280]   and he really, really tightened up the tracking.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.840]   And so again, today, it's not just that
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.760]   like the total market fund is three basis points,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.400]   but it's actually zero
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   because they're able to use securities lending
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.960]   and some passive management acumen
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.120]   to make up a couple of bits.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.200]   And that is, again, that's a modern miracle
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.720]   that you can get free exposure even beyond the fee.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.960]   It's funny when they first tried to pass
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.240]   the idea of an index fund to the board,
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.200]   they couldn't call the person running it
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.040]   a portfolio manager.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.440]   So they called Jay Antwardowsky, a portfolio administrator.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.080]   They didn't have any money in the fund.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.080]   They couldn't buy all 500 stocks until I believe it was 1977
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.240]   when Wellington merged one of their funds,
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.880]   one of their large cap funds into the S&P 500,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.800]   which brought the assets up enough
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.160]   to be able to buy all 500 stocks.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.560]   And then this was now the true replication of the S&P 500.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.040]   And they also fired all the brokers.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.480]   They went to a no load direct
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   to the consumer product with this fund.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.720]   And even then though, it took years, I think,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.200]   till they first got a billion dollars.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.040]   And it was something like at least 10 more years
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.480]   before that fund actually took in
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.320]   a billion dollars in assets.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.160]   Yeah, the amount of time it took
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.400]   was another thing that drew me to the story.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.400]   The other thing that I found interesting
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.760]   was not only everything you just said,
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.920]   but as it did get a little traction,
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.000]   they would turn down money regularly.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   I was shocked by that.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.280]   Gus Sauter told me that on multiple occasions,
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.040]   they'd have a big institution wanting to come in
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.320]   for like a month.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   But they were like, get out of here,
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   we don't want your money.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   And turning down money is something
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.040]   that a private equity manager would do,
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.200]   or perhaps you're in an area of the market
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.720]   that isn't liquid, like small caps.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.360]   But for a young, large cap fund to turn down money
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.760]   is really shocking.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.280]   And I think it speaks to the walk the walk.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.800]   This guy was all in and was able to sort of
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.200]   really discipline himself in a way
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.000]   that's so difficult in this industry.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.480]   People lose their minds, they want money,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.320]   they wanna get rich.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   And I get it, it's what draws people to Wall Street.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.400]   And this guy just seemed to not have any of that bug
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.640]   or any of those sort of tendencies,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   which enabled him, I think,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.960]   to walk this really straight line,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.680]   even if it meant slowing their growth rate.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.400]   He just seemed to be somebody who almost was miscast
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.720]   in the whole industry.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.320]   There was so many stories like that,
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.040]   which are just the opposite of what the natural tendency is
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.680]   for people in asset management to do.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.000]   And that's, I think, what it took to last all that time.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.160]   I think also the pain of working with the Thorndike guys
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.200]   and the idea of selling your soul during a bull market
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.640]   only to lose out.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.560]   I think that lesson allowed him to walk that straight line
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.200]   through many cycles and through many opportunities
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.160]   where he could have taken a faster route to higher assets.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.680]   It was purposely taking the slower, more prudent route.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.360]   And that core of investors that is long-term
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.200]   and his absolute protection of them
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.320]   is really, in my opinion, why today, when there's a sell-off
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.000]   you still see money going into Vanguard funds.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.440]   People are like, "How come Vanguard can take in
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.000]   "all this money when everybody else is losing money
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.320]   "'cause the market's down?"
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.920]   And I'm like, "You have to go to the core
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.520]   "and how it was built and how people found it
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.240]   "and the trust gained."
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.240]   And that's why I wanted to tell the story
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.920]   was it explained so much today.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.840]   - I wanna circle back a minute to mid-1970s
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.760]   when the first index fund was formed.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.480]   There was this whole academia thing going on
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.360]   called Efficient Market Hypothesis.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.000]   And people sometimes link indexing
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.320]   to the Efficient Market Hypothesis,
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.400]   saying, "Well, you can't beat the market.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.560]   "The market is the most efficient way to invest."
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.920]   That's what Bogle believed
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.680]   and that's why index funds were formed.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.600]   But none of that is true.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.280]   I mean, he didn't even know
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.160]   that the Efficient Market Hypothesis was going on,
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.560]   or even what it was,
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.640]   until long after he created the first index fund.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.680]   And this whole idea of you can't beat the market
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.960]   because the markets are efficient.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.360]   I mean, Jack Bogle never said that.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.840]   He was not anti-active.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.960]   - No, not at all.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.720]   Vanguard is the third biggest active manager today.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.360]   Bogle took almost more pride in the Wellington Fund
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.960]   in his books than any other fund, and that's active.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.760]   He loved the Prime Cap Fund.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.480]   I will say that the way he talks about
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.240]   why those funds are successful,
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.360]   it reminds me of the book "Moneyball" and "Sabermetrics."
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.720]   Whereas most active managers are like,
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.760]   "I've found this perfect formula.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.000]   I've found this premium and they got all this.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.840]   I've got all," you know,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.200]   and maybe they're highly educated
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.640]   and they are able to sort of sell that.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.400]   Bogle basically gave credit
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.000]   for why his active funds outperformed because of the costs.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.640]   He was able to keep eliminating basis points
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.520]   from their costs.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.800]   He also had, in some cases, multiple managers.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.840]   He wanted them to be more conservative, not trade a lot.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.480]   And I think those, I call them Bogle metrics.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.120]   Those data points,
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.320]   he attributed to why his active funds were so good.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.360]   So he was okay with active,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.080]   but he thought that costs really brought down
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:52.920]   most of the managers.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.320]   And in his book, he says they're all highly,
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.640]   you know, a lot of them are highly educated.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.400]   They're nice, they're honorable people,
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.520]   but they have math working against them.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.360]   They have cost working against them.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.080]   And the efficient market hypothesis,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.320]   I put in here that I get it.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.600]   And I think you could argue that like,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.320]   okay, there's all these people covering Amazon stock.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.520]   What could you possibly know?
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.560]   So for some big stocks,
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:15.120]   I think it does pass the sniff test.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.680]   Of course, Amazon is properly priced
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.960]   because there's all this information.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.240]   Everybody knows everything.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.480]   But the sniff test in a holistic sense doesn't work.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.840]   People probably would argue Tesla's overvalued.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.480]   It doesn't seem efficient right now.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.040]   Meme stocks, the market never seems perfectly efficient.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.120]   What Bogle came up with,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.480]   he riffed off of that and said,
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.560]   "I'm gonna do something called the cost matters hypothesis."
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.480]   And he wrote a journal indexing article on it.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.200]   That does pass the sniff test.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.800]   I think when people think about how much cost eat up,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   especially in a compounding way,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.400]   and they see charts of dollars and cents,
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.400]   I think that passes their sniff test.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.200]   So I think Bogle was actually good,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.520]   smart to avoid attaching himself with EMH
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.120]   and way better to focus on the cost,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.720]   which are, it's not as sexy.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   It's not as interesting.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.240]   Probably not gonna get any like Nobel prizes,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.160]   but it really, that's where the trillions in savings
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.440]   has come from, is just the costs.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.320]   And that's what he honed in on.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.040]   And that was probably his number one thing overall,
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.920]   beyond indexing, even beyond trading.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.560]   I think, and his son told me this.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.240]   He said, "He was preaching low cost from the day I was born
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.960]   until the day he died."
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.240]   - Vanguard was able to launch the S&P 500
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.920]   because it wasn't managed.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.160]   They were just administering it.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   But when they did get permission to manage money,
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.320]   some of the first funds that they launched
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.840]   were actively managed funds.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.680]   - Yeah.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.040]   - And they experimented with quant funds
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.960]   and they experimented with thematic funds
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   and they experimented with style funds, correct?
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   And value, they had the first value and growth funds.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.680]   I mean, this was not an indexing shop per se.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.960]   - Yeah, this is one of the most fascinating things
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.120]   about Bogle is he spearheaded all of these things.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.040]   He innovated all over the place.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.600]   Those growth value funds were innovative at the time.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.720]   He had a quantitative fund in '87.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.320]   That sounds normal today, but it was not normal back then.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   Bond funds, he innovated there, international,
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.160]   and even themes.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.920]   Vanguard did have a couple of theme funds.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.960]   What I found interesting is he would later in life
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.080]   come to trash all of it.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.520]   - Right, yeah.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.720]   - He would trash things he innovated
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.760]   and launched over and over and over.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.520]   And I think over his life, he just came to the conclusion
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.120]   that you just can't do better than buying the total market.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.000]   That was his true love, I think, the total market,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.560]   even beyond the S&P.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.400]   Buy the total market and just wait 50 years.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   And I think anything outside of that,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.040]   he came to just say, "It's just not worth it.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.640]   "It's going to mess you up.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.000]   "It's not necessary."
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.920]   And so I have a big theme in my book
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.200]   where I talk about this concept of addition by subtraction.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.120]   And to me, that was almost the name of the book,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.400]   because if you took Bogle's life work,
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.840]   I think it was taking this industry
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.880]   and just subtracting and subtracting and subtracting
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.640]   all the stuff you don't need
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.520]   to your left with basically frictionless exposure
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.240]   that's the most efficient way to grow wealth
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.640]   over 40, 50 years.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.840]   And for him, that was the total market fund.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.720]   Once you block into that,
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.080]   you start to look at your past innovations and funds
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.720]   and you're like, "Why did I even launch this?"
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.080]   And so there was a lot of conflict at the end,
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.680]   especially between Bogle trashing stuff at Vanguard
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.280]   that was actually doing quite well and taking in money.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.960]   It was really, it's kind of weird.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.800]   Studying Bogle and listening to him over 25 years
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.280]   and kind of dedicating my professional life
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.760]   towards that idea,
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.480]   I came to this four-step process that people go through.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.440]   And the first step is called darkness,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.000]   where you don't know what's going on,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.440]   or you're trying to beat the market,
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:58.080]   and you're out chasing dreams, if you will,
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.440]   and that's darkness.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.000]   And then you have enlightenment.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.280]   And enlightenment is when you discover indexing.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.680]   And for Jack Bogle, that happened in 1975,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.040]   and they launched the first fund in 1976.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.280]   He discovered the basic concept of indexing
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.720]   as a better solution, low fee, this is the way to do it.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.440]   But then you get into the next phase, which is complexity.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.400]   And as I look at John Bogle's life and Vanguard
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   and what they did,
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.720]   they took indexing to a different level
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.280]   with many of these quant funds,
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.320]   sort of a type of an index fund, if you will,
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.640]   'cause all they were doing was eliminating
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.240]   what they thought were the high-cost stocks
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.320]   in one of their quant funds.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.480]   And it's complexity.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.360]   You take something that's very simple,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   and you just make it more complex,
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.160]   value investing, growth investing,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.920]   factor investing, all of this.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.400]   And then finally, if you've done that enough,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.520]   you get to the last stage, which is simplicity.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   And what you just described,
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.280]   what I noticed in watching Jack Bogle's evolution
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.720]   over the 35-year period of my own evolution
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.440]   in this industry was you do eventually get to simplicity.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.920]   Total stock market is the place to be.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.320]   Total bond market, total international.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.400]   This is all you need.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.360]   And once you get to that phase,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.760]   you're at the fourth and final nirvana stage, if you will.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.600]   And that's what I learned from Bogle
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.840]   in at least his final years.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.640]   It finally occurred to me that this is what he was doing.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.480]   In fact, by the time Jack Bogle retired in 1996,
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.240]   he had the four funds, if you will,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.120]   that were necessary for this.
[00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.560]   He had developed a total stock market index fund.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.440]   He had developed a total international stock index fund.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.080]   He had developed a total bond market index fund.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.280]   And then he had another one for real estate.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.120]   And I throw that in because real estate
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.440]   is a big part of the economy,
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.560]   but not a very big part of the stock market.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.280]   And so he had the essentials to do a simple investing
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.040]   using just a few three-fund or perhaps four-fund portfolio.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.600]   A lot of people I interviewed are fans of international,
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.440]   and he wasn't.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.120]   He would actually say almost like half of the stuff
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.160]   you just named, you don't need.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.000]   Again, he actually started to cut away stuff
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.960]   that would, I think, traditionally be looked at
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.480]   as a main core holding for most people.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.360]   International is probably the biggest area.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.200]   I found three things that he thought
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.680]   that almost everybody who loved him disagreed with.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.760]   ETFs, international, and the idea
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.160]   that the asset management industry
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.040]   will ultimately all go or mutualize.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.960]   Almost everybody I spoke with basically said,
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.480]   "I love him, but I disagree with him on those issues."
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.480]   But you have to take them all seriously
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.720]   and at least consider them.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.880]   And I think, you know, I talked to Dan Egan of Betterment
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.800]   about the international.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.200]   I think he put it best when he said,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.080]   "Well, Rome fell," and that you can't argue with that.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.080]   And I think that's one area where I kind of agree
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.360]   with Dan and not Bogle.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.080]   I think international is good to own,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.680]   just in case for that diversification purposes.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.520]   But Bogle would probably argue,
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.680]   "Well, you know, 40% of U.S. stocks
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.200]   "get the revenue from overseas.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.920]   "Therefore, you're already exposed."
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.800]   But anyway, that's, again, if simplification
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.520]   is those four things you named,
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.000]   he's beyond Nirvana, I guess,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.120]   'cause he got it down to just basically the total market.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.440]   And, you know, I think he did own some bonds on the side,
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   like some, I think he had some munis and stuff
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.320]   for tax purposes, though.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.800]   But beyond that, that was mainly-
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.640]   Sure, sure.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.040]   And once he locked into that utter, utter simplicity
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.160]   of like one holding, it was just hard for him.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.640]   You know, he can't, like, it's not Bogle's nature
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.440]   to not speak his mind.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.320]   So that had him, again, at the end of his career,
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.280]   kind of bashing and dumping on a lot of stuff
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.040]   that was taking in money at Vanguard.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.560]   So I used to have this chart back in the day
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:41.800]   when I would go around to presentations,
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.600]   and I'm like, "Vanguard is so in the zone right now
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.080]   "that they're taking in cash and stuff
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   "that Bogle trashes regularly."
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.880]   Smart beta, international.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.160]   And I'm like, "That's how powerful Vanguard has gotten,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.000]   "is that the founder is dumping on these areas
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.400]   "and they're crushing."
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.240]   So let's get into the Bogle effect.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.960]   Okay, so we've talked just about Vanguard
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.760]   and what Vanguard did and how they grew
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.000]   and the different things that Jack Bogle tried
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.800]   and ultimately getting to, you know,
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.160]   the total market, portfolios.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.640]   But it's just not Vanguard.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   I mean, the Bogle effect is throughout the entire industry,
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.200]   I would say throughout much of the economy,
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.480]   and globally, this effect that he created
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.400]   through low fee or cost matter hypothesis,
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.800]   just grabbed hold.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.480]   You know, I wrote a book about ETFs back a few years ago,
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.520]   and the bottom line is it all has Bogle in it.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.840]   The whole ETF industry has Bogle in it,
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.080]   even though he hated ETFs.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.280]   Yeah, so this was fascinating.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.680]   And I remember when Vanguard cut their commissions
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.480]   on their trading platform, maybe five years ago,
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.840]   they had a commission-free ETFs.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.720]   They were really the first major one
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.960]   to go to commission-free trading ETFs.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.120]   Everybody followed.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.080]   And it was at that point I said,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.960]   "Wait, Vanguard's actually leading in that."
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.320]   And then I really started to unpack
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.800]   where their impact is coming from.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.400]   So you have the trading platforms largely followed Vanguard
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.040]   going commission-free.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.920]   Then you've got other people launching index funds and ETFs
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.680]   at the same price points as Vanguard funds,
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.280]   because Vanguard has 50% of the passive market share,
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   but the other 50% are people who basically copy them.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.600]   And a lot of people in the book would say something
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.800]   like they did it kicking and screaming.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   Vanguard did it because they wanted to,
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.960]   and that mattered to them.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   But they all acknowledged
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.840]   that Vanguard was probably the reason
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.280]   those other firms came in at those low price points.
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.440]   And then you look at something
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.480]   like the advisor world and behavior.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.680]   And I know this is a great topic you love,
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.440]   but I would also argue
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.280]   that the Bogle effect is huge in behavior,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.520]   not just because Bogle railed against trading.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.040]   We know that trading was right up there
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.840]   on his deadly sins.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   But that the index fund gave people something worth holding.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.560]   A cheap index fund was such an innovation and such a,
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.640]   as you call it, like the value proposition was so high.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.280]   And people who lock into an index fund,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.720]   I think if you ask them, they would say,
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.120]   "Well, even if the market's down, what am I gonna do?
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.520]   "Jump on some fund that might have had a good year?
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.040]   "Uh-uh, I'm in a good spot."
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.000]   That makes behavior so much easier.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.400]   So I know people preach behavior
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.860]   and they give credit to some of these studies,
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.720]   but honestly, behavior's gotten way easier
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.160]   because of the cheap index fund.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.240]   So that tool has really allowed for this whole birth
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.720]   of this new generation of advisors
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.760]   who are very behaviorally focused.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.480]   And it's helped their clients save
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720]   and build their wealth over the years.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.920]   There's been a lot of sell-offs over the past 12 years.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.880]   And if you basically dumped everything,
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.360]   you have lost out on a lot of future gains.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.000]   So behavior is something I think Vanguard had a role
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.600]   in two parts, just the preaching of don't trade,
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.920]   and it's the idea that you now have something worth holding.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   And I think there's a resignation,
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.560]   a positive resignation by a lot of people
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.960]   who own a cheap index fund that I'm done.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   I'm just not gonna run around
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.520]   trying to find something better.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.280]   And that's why you see them taking flows
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.500]   even during sell-offs.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.240]   Well, that's interesting because I've been an advisor
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.520]   for almost 35 years now.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.160]   And so I've lived through this evolution.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   And advisors didn't wanna do the indexing thing at first.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.040]   Back in the 1990s, when I converted over to indexing,
[00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.080]   they didn't wanna do it.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.540]   They were the masters, if you will.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.000]   They would take these mutual funds
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.100]   and mix them and match them
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.860]   and try to outperform the market
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.080]   and find the active managers
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.400]   that were gonna outperform and so forth.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.320]   But as they began to see flows going out
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.680]   and as more and more studies were published
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.560]   showing that indexing was in fact outperforming,
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.800]   they finally came into it.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   And then you had the evolution of ETFs,
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.080]   which made it easier to trade these index funds.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.240]   It was hard being at, let's say at Charles Schwab
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:06.200]   or someplace and trying to trade vanguard index funds
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.080]   because sometimes they didn't allow you
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.820]   to trade certain class shares
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.600]   and they were high commission to buy them.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.120]   So when ETFs came along,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.160]   for advisors who weren't custodying at Vanguard,
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.320]   it just made indexing so much easier.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.040]   And even the brokerage industry now,
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.400]   when I was a broker where I started out,
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.020]   the only thing I could buy was SPY, the S&P 500
[00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.920]   and MDY, the S&P 400 mid cap.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.920]   And that was in the, let's say 1996, 1997,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.320]   when I started using those.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.160]   That was it.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.320]   That was the only thing that was available.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.800]   But by the early 2000s,
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.520]   you had a much more variety of ETFs
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.720]   that advisors could use both in the brokerage industry
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.840]   and independent advisors.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.320]   And I think this then helped them move their business models
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.200]   more to a core and satellite.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.420]   They weren't ready to give up on active management just yet.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   They went to a core indexing and then satellite of,
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.200]   okay, now we're gonna pick a few areas
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.520]   where we think we're gonna outperform.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.680]   That didn't really work,
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.740]   but that's where the first phase was for the advisors.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.960]   - It's also interesting.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.120]   And I explore this a little.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.840]   I have your story and some other people's stories in there.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.000]   In terms of the other side of the mountain,
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   as Michael Kitsis puts it in the 80s and 90s,
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.320]   I think advisors deserve a lot of credit
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.800]   in really helping to build vanguard.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.920]   Because once they went from the,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.380]   I'm getting paid by the mutual fund
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.400]   to I'm gonna get a percentage of assets,
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.800]   all of a sudden they're now shoulder to shoulder
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.800]   with the client.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.080]   And they're gonna obviously pick things they think are good
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.720]   and that are cheap and will benefit them too.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.800]   'Cause now they're gonna draw from that same pool of money.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.960]   And that really was major.
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.720]   If you were to chart the growth of Vanguard's assets
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.700]   and that move to the fee-based fiduciary advisor,
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.480]   I think there's a strong correlation there.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.440]   And the amount of money, and it's growing,
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.200]   certainly has great stats showing that,
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.960]   I believe 71% of the assets now
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.120]   in the brokerage advisor worlds are fee-based fiduciary
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.360]   type assets.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.200]   But it was interesting.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.680]   And I tried to see if maybe Bogle actually,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.460]   by actually building Vanguard and putting Vanguard
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.900]   on the other side of the mountain,
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.200]   where most brokers couldn't get to it
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.160]   unless they left where they were.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.640]   Remember, you're outside of the system.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.480]   So you gotta get people to leave the system.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.480]   - Right.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.720]   That's what he wanted to do.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.240]   That's exactly what he wanted.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.080]   That's correct.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.320]   - And they did.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.120]   And I asked a few people whether Bogle should get credit
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.760]   for actually getting people to leave the system
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:39.840]   and become RIAs.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.960]   And some people were like, "Definitely."
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.800]   And some people were like,
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.000]   "No, there was all these other things going on."
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.380]   And I tried to be nuanced.
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.200]   But I have to think that the idea of not being able
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.880]   to get this amazing vehicle for your clients
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.440]   where you were might be one of the reasons
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.480]   you were inspired to leave.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.760]   Maybe also the weighing on the conscious
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.320]   that I'm putting my clients in stuff
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.420]   that I would never invest in.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:08.200]   And maybe over time that right the weight on them.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.360]   But I try to think, let's say there was no index fund,
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.120]   cheap index fund or something
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.360]   on the other side of the mountain.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.240]   Would brokers have left the droves and become RIAs?
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.040]   And I don't know, I'd ask you that.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.940]   - No, I probably personally.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:23.440]   Personally, I probably would have become an airline pilot
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.360]   because I was a pilot in the military
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   and I was really just couldn't stand
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.280]   the brokerage industry anymore.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.300]   Once I learned about, well, let me say,
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.620]   if the indexing didn't exist,
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.980]   I probably wouldn't be in the investment industry anymore
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.980]   because I was so disgusted with what was passing
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.060]   for investment advice in the brokerage world
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.780]   that I was ready to leave it anyway.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.140]   But then I discovered Jack Bogle and discovered indexing
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.820]   and realized that if I left and started my own company
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.460]   that I could have access to all these things for my clients.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.220]   And yeah, that was the reason I left.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.700]   And then I also, I think,
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.920]   helped start driving down advisor costs
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.220]   because as soon as I left,
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.780]   I realized advisors were charging
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.180]   too much money for this too.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.900]   So I started a low fee advisory company back then.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.600]   But yeah, and I completely agree with you.
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.820]   I think a lot of advisors left the brokerage industry
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.380]   so that they could put their clients,
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.500]   they're being fiduciaries and put their clients
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.680]   into the things that they thought
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.060]   that their clients would benefit from
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.180]   and indexing was one of them.
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.980]   And ETFs were another one.
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.700]   And I told Jack this before he died.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.180]   I said, "You know, I know you don't like ETFs,
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.740]   but I think that there's nothing that has happened
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:44.180]   in the last 25 years have advanced your beliefs
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.500]   more than ETFs have."
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.700]   And he goes, "Eh," you know, he didn't wanna believe that,
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.820]   but I think it's true, don't you?
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:54.580]   Yes, ETFs have done a lot to get people low cost
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.220]   than indexing and not all ETFs trade a lot.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.300]   The Vanguard ETFs in particular are basically bought and held
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.060]   I mean, they're not really trading tools.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.340]   And he did acknowledge that.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.260]   I also had a revelation in the book that I did not know.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.460]   And I interviewed Gus Sauter,
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:09.900]   who was probably one of the best interviews of the book
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.740]   because he was there.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.880]   And he said that the reason he pushed to launch the ETF
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.500]   was because he was trying to figure out a way
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.180]   that if the next crash came,
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.580]   he could protect the index fund investors
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.780]   from people who wanna trade or go in and out.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.980]   And so he didn't do it to increase distribution,
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.180]   which is what Bogle seemed to insinuate
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.340]   when I met with him.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.940]   It was more to protect the investor,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.780]   which is right up Bogle's alley.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.900]   Now it did increase distribution,
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.420]   but Sauter said he caught up with Bogle in 2014-ish,
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.420]   or 14 years after they launched the first ETF
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:42.740]   and told him this.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.580]   And he said, "Bogle didn't quite know that."
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.100]   And so I think that's why towards the end of his life,
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.380]   he did soften.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.060]   And in my last, very last interview with him,
[00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.740]   we asked about the ETF again.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.940]   And he said, "You know, if I was running the place,
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.900]   "I probably would have done it too."
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.460]   And I know he wouldn't have,
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.300]   but the fact that he threw that line out,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.580]   I thought he'd come to some general peace with it.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.580]   But after he says that, there's a dot, dot, dot,
[00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.040]   "But look at all these people chasing returns and trading.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.060]   "We still don't know.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.460]   "And all the fruit cases and nut jobs and marketing."
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.940]   So he's talking about the other side of ETFs,
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.020]   the dark side of ETFs.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.140]   I think the ETF industry is a big tent.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.700]   And I think there's a section in that tent
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.140]   for Puritan index investors that are up Bogle's alley.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.820]   But then there's maybe 50% of the tent
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.100]   that wild and crazy and the opposite,
[00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.660]   people and doing things that he wants no part of.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.180]   And so that's why I call that chapter, "It's Complicated."
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.500]   The metaphor I use is that
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.220]   it's like Bogle's firstborn daughter,
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.340]   like the index fund, marrying the tatted up bad boy.
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.500]   And Bogle, there's nothing he can do about it.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.940]   He's got to learn to deal with this guy and his family.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:53.260]   Yeah, and that was how he spent 20 years of his life.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.900]   And that's why him and Vanguard
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.780]   had this really interesting relationship
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.300]   where Bogle's sitting over here
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.980]   in his research center on campus,
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.940]   only a hundred yards from where upper management is.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.460]   And he's sort of constantly dropping bombs.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.100]   He's lobbing mortars over there.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.980]   Yeah, and I have found that very interesting,
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:13.420]   sometimes funny.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.420]   I think when the ETF came out, Jim Wyatt told me,
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:16.500]   and I didn't know this,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.260]   that Vanguard put a press release out
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.660]   and then Bogle put another one out.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.660]   So I was like, "Gosh, this sucks."
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.500]   So he's a character.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.180]   Interesting that Warren Buffett is one of his biggest fans.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.140]   Yeah, I wanted to interview Warren Buffett for the book.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.900]   I interviewed about 50 people
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.460]   and I asked our people in TV if I could get his email.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.460]   And they were like, "Okay, here's his assistant's email,
[00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.060]   "but look, he's not going to reply.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.600]   "If you really want to bother, go ahead and try it.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.140]   "Just be nice, but don't expect anything."
[00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.740]   I sent him an email.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:46.020]   I got a reply, I don't know,
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.500]   within about six, seven hours from Warren,
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.780]   who said, "Look, I'm swamped,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.540]   "but I'm going to help on a couple items about Jack."
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.180]   And he answered every question I had.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.580]   Warren Buffett is interesting one
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.620]   because he's the most popular active manager
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.940]   who's ever lived.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.260]   And yet he has this interesting kinship with Bogle.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.540]   And I think what they really do share
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.980]   is the Great Depression, World War II generation attitude.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.700]   They're both very frugal.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.900]   They don't need a lot.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:10.740]   Bogle's son was saying,
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.620]   "You wore the same khakis for 46 years."
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.820]   That's something you might read about Warren Buffett doing.
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.220]   And it was almost like they were cut from the same cloth,
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.180]   where, ironically, one is the king of active
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.660]   and one's the king of passive.
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.140]   But they're very similar in every other way, I thought,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.340]   when reading about him.
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.460]   I think that's what Warren Buffett was responding to.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.340]   And I think, as Jason Zweig said,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.420]   Buffett and Bogle also fought against
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.920]   some of the same forces of overcharging for undervalue.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.820]   And I think Buffett was famous
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.660]   for betting against hedge fund performance.
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.380]   And in some of his letters,
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.700]   he's pretty adamant against how little value
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.140]   some active can actually produce.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.340]   And so they were aligned on that issue, I think.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:55.900]   And Buffett, again, was really, I guess, generous to respond,
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:58.660]   but I definitely was happy he did.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:00.140]   - I'm just gonna go into one more section,
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.460]   and then we're gonna wrap it up.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.620]   And that has to do with takeoffs on indexing
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.920]   and things that aren't really indexing,
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.260]   but are being called indexing,
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.780]   to try to jump on the coattails here.
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.300]   Thank you for mentioning Spindexing.
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.820]   In your book, a phrase I came up with,
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.060]   it stands for?
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.860]   - Special Purpose Indexing, or Spindexing,
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.220]   which is everything's an index now.
[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:23.580]   Because Bogle made indexing
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:25.260]   and Vanguard made indexing so popular,
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.140]   why not just call whatever it is you're doing indexing?
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.860]   Even if it isn't indexing, call it that anyway.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.740]   Because then you might get assets.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:33.860]   - For example?
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.180]   - Smart beta, right?
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.860]   And direct indexing, and ESG,
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.340]   and all these things are now indexing.
[00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.080]   Could you speak to sort of people
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.780]   jumping on the coattails of Bogle,
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.000]   even though it really isn't what he was all about?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.060]   There's two points I wanna make here.
[00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.860]   One is, you're right, Bogle was not into this.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.060]   There's one quote where he said,
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.420]   "No wonder I wake up some mornings
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.140]   "feeling like Dr. Frankenstein.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.900]   "What have I created?"
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.660]   And so he definitely battled against that.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.260]   Again, that 50% of the ETF tent
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.620]   that's pretty wild and crazy.
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:07.060]   That said, this is another interesting part of the book,
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.020]   which is that he kind of created it
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.900]   in a way that's not really, I think,
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.340]   appreciated or understood yet,
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.720]   which is that by taking over the core of portfolios,
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.300]   a lot of people have now sold out
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.940]   of their legacy active mutual fund
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.740]   and now have a cheap index fund or cheap ETF in the core.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:27.660]   By being so successful with that concept,
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.420]   he then pushed active and ways to be active
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.060]   to a complete extreme.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.100]   So now people who have a boring vanilla core,
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.500]   which is highly effective, not all people,
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.300]   I think you're maybe in that nirvana stage
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.900]   that you can actually not take the bait on some of that.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.280]   Some people look for things to decorate with.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.140]   And that's why spindexing and themes are no joke.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.820]   They seem like they're crazy and who cares?
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:57.700]   But you have crypto, ARK, ESG, thematic investing,
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.220]   some smart beta.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:03.340]   A lot of this, honestly, is to compliment that core now.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.220]   And that's why you see the number of holdings
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.140]   in new ETFs come down and down.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.980]   Portfolios are getting more concentrated.
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.460]   It's again, it's really, again, part of the Bogle effect.
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:15.540]   By confiscating the core of the portfolio,
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.180]   it's then made active have to get more creative
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.340]   and more active.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.300]   - So a barbell type of a thing.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:23.940]   - Yes, and I have a whole chapter that looks at that.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.500]   And so while he would have hated it, again,
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:26.980]   I think he had a hand in creating it
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.900]   by being so successful in the core.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.900]   He would say, just use the core and be a monk
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.400]   and basically have the total index.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.740]   But some of us are human.
[00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.660]   And I also think there's arguably a behavioral hack.
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.940]   If you have a cheap core and it's vanilla
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.980]   and you're just the kind of person
[00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.020]   whose mind's buzzing all the time,
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.580]   maybe you want 10% in the crazy stuff,
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.340]   stuff that has amazing possible asymmetric return
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.180]   down the road that's exciting, that's entertaining,
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.480]   that's a narrative driven,
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:53.980]   just to keep your hands off the core.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:55.220]   If it keeps your hands busy,
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.400]   it's actually potentially Bogley
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.760]   in that it's helping you behaviorally to do that.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.400]   I'm not sure he would buy that.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.340]   - I wrote about this in my very first book
[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:07.220]   called "Serious Money."
[00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.100]   It's like you do your core indexing
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.500]   and then you can have what I call bingo money on the side,
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.940]   which is your fund money as small,
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.980]   maybe up to 10% of your portfolio, but that's it.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.940]   But I have to tell you,
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.300]   working with individual investors and myself
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:24.000]   now that I'm in my mid-60s,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.900]   it just doesn't appeal to me anymore.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:28.220]   In other words, it's, yeah, okay,
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.220]   I was interested in it in the past and all that.
[00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.100]   Now, and I can see Bogle, see this with Bogle.
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.660]   I mean, it's just something that as you kind of get on
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.660]   to pre-retirement and retirement,
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.540]   that stuff doesn't interest you anymore.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.540]   So you end up going to this pure core, pure core.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.580]   - Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.300]   I think that there's probably gonna be some correlation
[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.760]   with age, crypto, ARK.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.620]   I bet their investors are on the younger side.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.420]   And maybe as you get older, you get over that stuff.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.580]   I will say on the flip side,
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.220]   there were people like Michael Lewis,
[00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.540]   who I interviewed for the book.
[00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.940]   And he said something that I thought was really, again,
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.380]   another amazing by-product of the Bogle effect.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:11.800]   He said, "Once I got my portfolio into index funds,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.120]   "I had way more time on my hands.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.960]   "I didn't have to think about this stuff.
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.460]   "And that really helped me as a writer,
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.060]   "'cause I could just go into my writing head all the time."
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.740]   And I guess because he was in the financial world,
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.580]   he would think about where to put money.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:28.700]   But once he got the index fund, it freed up time.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.900]   Dan Egan said the same thing.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.360]   He now, as an advisor, doesn't have to worry about portfolio.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:33.920]   He can worry about the other stuff,
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.120]   planning, taxes, behavior.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.800]   And that time freedom,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.640]   I think for really evolved investors, is big.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.340]   I just think there are probably some maybe
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.240]   who like the cheap index fund, but do wanna dabble.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.160]   And they actually like following the market and stuff.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.160]   And for them, I think spindexing is sort of,
[00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.480]   that's why it exists,
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:55.640]   because you do have some people buying it.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.760]   And perhaps there's just some people
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.360]   who are all in on the crazy stuff,
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.280]   and they'll learn the hard way.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.960]   I have a chapter called "The Art of Doing Nothing."
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.640]   And I talk about the Robinhood and the trading.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.320]   And my thesis there is that
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:06.840]   this is just a generational thing.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.320]   The '90s had the same thing.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:11.160]   You're young, you don't know, you go through this.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.600]   The Robinhood army is Vanguard investors waiting to happen.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.400]   - That is absolutely correct.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.600]   The people who are trading dot-com companies
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.520]   in the early, mid-1990s and late 1990s
[00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.360]   are the Vanguard investors of today.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.120]   - Yes, and I think there's a line in war games,
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.880]   which I think about a lot as myself,
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.800]   which is the only winning move is to not play.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.520]   - To close, you wrote that Bogle realized
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.480]   that making money was rewarding.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.840]   And he realized that, making money is rewarding,
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.480]   but the thanks and admiration
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.440]   that he received from investors
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.840]   was much more rewarding to him.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.960]   And it was actually, in my view, intoxicating to him.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:56.080]   I knew Jack for probably, oh, I don't know, 20 years.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.800]   I saw him a lot at the Bogle Heads conferences.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:02.080]   And we're starting that up again, by the way, in October.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:06.360]   But he felt that it was much more important to him
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.600]   personally, professionally, spiritually,
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:13.200]   to be appreciated for what he did helping people
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.720]   than any amount of money that he could have made
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.160]   as the CEO of a mutual fund company.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:19.880]   We say around the Bogle Heads,
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.120]   Jack Bogle knew he could make a lot of money,
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.680]   but he chose to make a difference.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:27.480]   And that was Jack Bogle.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.440]   He wrote a book called "Enough."
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:32.120]   And he clearly had some gene in him
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.440]   that wasn't attracted to the sort of thirst for more
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:40.480]   that a lot of people who go to Wall Street have in them.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.160]   And it's just a natural gene.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.600]   It's like fire in your belly stuff.
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.480]   He just didn't have that.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.800]   He was immune to it.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.320]   But what he could never get enough of
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:49.120]   was appreciation and adulation.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.640]   And his son was saying that his whole family
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.400]   never quite understood that part of him.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.680]   He could never get enough of hearing,
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.200]   you know, like the guy on the street saying,
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.480]   you saved me money, whatever.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.280]   He saved almost every letter.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.800]   You know, he was, Aaron Arvillan from the Philippine Choir
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.160]   said he would read letters to her in his office
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:08.680]   from doormen who put the other kid through college.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   And that's why I say that in a weird way,
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.320]   he might've been miscast.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.360]   It's almost like somebody who wants adulation
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.280]   and appreciation would go into the arts
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.320]   or acting or something, or be a physician.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.480]   Bogle was, it's a good miss.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.360]   Sometimes it's good to have somebody miscast in an industry.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.520]   And it's also interesting back to Princeton
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.120]   to go full circle with this,
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.840]   that I found it just crazy
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.920]   that the whole reason he did all this
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.360]   is he's in the Princeton library looking for a thesis,
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.000]   something to write his thesis on.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.360]   And he's just flipping through magazines
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   and he happens to find Fortune.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.200]   And in the magazine,
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.480]   there's this article on mutual funds in Boston
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.200]   when he decides, okay, I'll do this.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.280]   Well, I looked and the cover of Time,
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.320]   which was probably laying right next to it,
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:50.440]   was Conrad Hilton.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.240]   This is December, 1949 and had a hotel business.
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.320]   And I thought, it's just as easy.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.760]   Could have picked that up and been like the hotel guy.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.360]   And it's interesting.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.760]   It's almost like fate nudged him to this
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.960]   because between that and the crazy Wellington story
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.880]   that had like four things that had to go exactly perfectly.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.480]   And then the index fund isn't managed.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.800]   You realize the amount of serendipity,
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.320]   you almost feel like there was some kind of
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.120]   fate nudging this to happen.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.280]   It's really crazy.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.440]   And I didn't realize it all until I dove into it,
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.960]   just how serendipitous the whole thing was.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.000]   - Well, the name of the book is called
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.360]   "The Bogle Effect" by Eric Balchun.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.880]   It's coming out April 26th.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.880]   Eric, I thank you so much for coming on

[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.120]   And as you know, I am a big fan of the podcast
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:41.240]   and it's quoted several times in the book.
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.480]   You really, through your interviews,
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.360]   you've got some gems that came in handy
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.720]   in my writing there.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.360]   So thank you for that.
