[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Pastor John, we have a podcast on fasting,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.120]   which has proven to be quite popular,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.200]   and which is titled, "What is the Purpose of Fasting?"
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.920]   Episode number 72.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.000]   But in this podcast series,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.400]   we have not talked much more about food more generally.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.320]   Food is such a big part of our lives.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.720]   And Pastor John, what does the Bible instruct us
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.200]   about the right and wrong ways to think about food?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.760]   - Well, as I thought about this, Tony,
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.960]   what seemed to be helpful here
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   would be to just take five passages of scripture
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.120]   and bullet them as a kind of
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.000]   primer on a theology of food,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.480]   which will function then as a kind of protection
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.000]   against idolatries of the misuse of food.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.960]   So food's proper and improper place in our lives
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.920]   growing out of these texts.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.200]   So this is very incipient.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.080]   What I hope people will do is just take these
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   and think with me rather than thinking,
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.520]   this is the end of thought here.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.080]   Is this really the beginning?
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.880]   So I think I've got five passages,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.840]   and I'll just mention them in a comment or two.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920]   Number one, 1 Timothy 4, 4 and 5,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.880]   "Everything created by God is good,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.140]   "and nothing is to be rejected
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.480]   "if it is received with thanksgiving,
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.880]   "for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer."
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.640]   And he's talking there about food and sex.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.520]   So food is God's idea,
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.120]   both its nutritional value and its taste.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.720]   We'll see that more in a minute.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.920]   It is for believers, not just the world in general.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.200]   God made food for his children.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.980]   It is not automatically honoring to God.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.040]   I say it's not automatic because Paul says
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   you need to sanctify it by the word of God and prayer.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.920]   So food is not ultimate.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920]   It's not the final good.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.880]   You have to do something with it
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.720]   in order to experience it as part of the final good.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.660]   You have to, in prayer and in the word,
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.600]   turn it into something holy,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.400]   and then enjoy it with gratitude
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.920]   as an expression of your embrace of that holiness.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.560]   So that's number one.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.600]   Number two, Psalm 34, eight,
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good."
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.680]   Now, the reason that's important
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.960]   is because God here is to be tasted.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.040]   Now, the only way that we know the meaning
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.440]   of the word taste is because we have tongues,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.480]   we have taste buds, and we have food.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.480]   So clearly, food is a type or a shadow
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.240]   or a pointer or a parable
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.800]   so that when God is brought into our consciousness,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.120]   we will have some appropriate categories
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   for how we feast upon God.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.680]   And the very word feast implies I have feasted.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.600]   And if I say, "Taste and see that the Lord is good,"
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.680]   then I have tasted bread,
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.880]   and I can know what it means that He's the bread of life.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   I've tasted water, and I can know what it means
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.400]   that He satisfies my thirst.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   So what we enjoy in food, we should find in God.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.760]   In fact, we should find God
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   in the very enjoyment of our food.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.840]   Number three, 1 Corinthians 6, 12, and 13,
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.840]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.360]   but not all things are helpful.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.600]   All things are lawful for me,
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.560]   but I will not be dominated or controlled
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.680]   or enslaved by anything.
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.960]   Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food,
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.800]   and God will destroy both one and the other.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   The body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body."
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.560]   That's an amazing statement.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.040]   The Lord is for the body.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.880]   So food and stomach are not ultimate.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.760]   They're gonna be destroyed someday.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.160]   Don't treat them as your idols.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.400]   If you treat them as gods, your gods are gonna perish.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.720]   Food is lawful.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.840]   That's what Paul says here, but not as a master.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   So as soon as food moves from being your servant
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.640]   to satisfy your appropriate hungers
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.720]   and send you with thrilled thanksgiving to God
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.000]   and know that God tastes even better
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.480]   than anything you just ate,
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.200]   as soon as it ceases to be that,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.280]   it starts to become a master.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.000]   And Paul said, "Don't be mastered by anything,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.160]   especially food."
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   So the Lord is for the body.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   He's not against it.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.440]   That's why he does not want us to be mastered
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.240]   by anything but himself.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.720]   Number four, this is Matthew 6, 17.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.920]   "When you fast, anoint your head, wash your face,
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.120]   that your fasting may not be seen by others,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   but by your Father who's in secret,
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.880]   and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.560]   It says, notice, "When you fast," not "If you fast."
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.040]   Fasting is normal.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   Why would that be?
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160]   Why would God in this age build fasting,
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.560]   that is the abstinence from something that he created
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   and that's perfectly good, why would he do that?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.880]   And I think he did it because it's a way of saying,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.880]   I am not mastered by my delight in my food.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.520]   I am mastered by my delight in God,
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.400]   and I want to intensify that.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.760]   And one way to intensify it is abstaining
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.280]   from alternative pleasures so that,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   without calling them evil at all,
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.400]   I can just say, God is better, God is better.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.480]   And so I think we should say with our bodies periodically,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.080]   and there's no New Testament rule here that I know of
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.600]   that tells you how often to fast,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.520]   but periodically say, I love you, God.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   I love you more than I love food.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.980]   I need you more than I need food.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.920]   I want you more than I want food.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.840]   You taste better to me spiritually
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.200]   than food tastes to me physically.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.260]   So that's number four.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.920]   And finally, Matthew 4, 3 and 4.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   The devil said to Jesus, if you're the son of God,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.920]   command these stones to become loaves of bread.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.040]   And he said, it is written, man shall not live
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.280]   by bread alone, but by every word
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.320]   that comes out of the mouth of God.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.020]   Our final nourishment is not material food,
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.180]   but spiritual food.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.300]   We need the word of God vastly more
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.960]   than we need physical food.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.080]   I think everybody who has time to eat breakfast
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   in the morning and no time to have devotions should ask,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.880]   does he really believe that?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.580]   The steadfast love of the Lord is better than life.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.480]   And so the word that mediates the love of God
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.800]   is more important than life-sustaining food.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.140]   In the end, everyone is controlled by appetite.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.660]   Either an appetite that glorifies God
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.660]   by showing he's our supreme satisfaction,
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.900]   or an appetite for food.
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.120]   That would then be an idolatry,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.260]   because it would seem to say that food
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.460]   is more satisfying to me than God.
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.060]   So concluding exhortation to us all,
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.900]   let's cultivate a taste for God,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.100]   an appetite for God and his word
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.660]   that out satisfies everything.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.500]   - Yes, amen.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.640]   And speaking of food, we'd love to hear
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.560]   other food-related questions from you.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.540]   Email those to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.220]   So what is fasting and what is the purpose of fasting?
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.420]   We tackled that way back in episode number 72 of the series.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.980]   If you'd like more information, you can check it out.
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.700]   And next time we're back and we're talking about sin
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.140]   and the speed limit.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.620]   Is it wrong to drive five to 10 miles per hour
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.500]   over the speed limit?
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.600]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.020]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
