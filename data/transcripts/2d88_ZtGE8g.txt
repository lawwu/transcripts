[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740]   I have a lot of books.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.920]   I enjoy reading them, but I don't think I'm doing it right.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.240]   And I know that sounds so ridiculous.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.640]   Like I know how to read the words on the page, but I feel like if you've written posts and
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.860]   made videos about reading effectively and efficiently, I'm confident that there's a
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.280]   way I can do it better.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.720]   So do you read on physical book or Kindle or what's your jam?
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.840]   To be honest, I a lot of times get the ebook and then I, but I sometimes really prefer
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.620]   the physical book, but I could do both.
[00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.360]   I'm not like wedded to one or the other, but I am not good at audio books, despite being
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760]   great at podcasts.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.760]   I don't know.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.720]   I feel like whenever I'm listening to an audio book, sometimes I get distracted and then
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.240]   I realize, Oh, I missed the last five minutes.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.280]   And if I try to not be distracted and I just like lie in bed to listen, then I find that,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.680]   you know, I might fall asleep or something.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   I know.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   I know what you mean.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.260]   I guess another question I would ask, and maybe you can answer like what your listeners
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.560]   would be thinking about this is like, why do you want to read more effectively?
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   Like what's, what's the point?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.640]   Retention.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.240]   You know, I read a lot of things and I learned these fascinating things, especially when
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.120]   I'm reading books that people I'm interviewing have written.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.360]   I want to remember those things, not just for five minutes, you know, not just for the
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   day.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.720]   I want to process them.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.320]   And then, you know, to the extent they're a way to read, I don't know, faster or more
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.040]   efficiently like that, there's kind of like efficiently, maybe effectively it's like effectively
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.600]   I retain the information efficiently.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   It just happens faster.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   Yeah, sure.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.640]   Um, have you come across building a second brain?
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.960]   So I'm, I'm going back and forth with Tiago, uh, who will come on the show a little later
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   this year.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   Amazing.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.120]   That's the, I mean, I took his course in like 2019, 2020, something like that.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.960]   And that introduced me to a lot of ideas around, um, kind of, uh, retention of staff and taking
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560]   information and doing useful things with it.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   Um, it's a fairly expensive course, but the book covers all of the things and the book
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.720]   is like, you know, the price of a book it's, it's recently come out, but broadly, I think
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.440]   the easy hack, uh, we're all about hacks here for remembering stuff is to, um, basically
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   use readwise.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.840]   I have yet to find an app that is better than readwise at, at this, uh, which if you're
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.960]   highlighting things on Kindle, it automatically files them.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880]   It also has like an app where you can literally scan the text of a book as you're reading
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   it.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.780]   If you want a thing and it will OCR recognize the characters and we'll recognize what book
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.400]   it's from and we'll just categorize it automatically.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.160]   And then just by virtue of reading that email every day of like five highlights, five things
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.740]   that have resonated enough with you for you to want to highlight that I have, I found
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.080]   that to be genuinely the single biggest thing that has changed the game in terms of my retention
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   of ideas.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.320]   And people were like, Oh, you know, when you're on podcasts, how are you able to cite all
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   these sources and these books and quotes and stuff?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.400]   I want to say, cause I look at the readwise email once in a while and it just kind of
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.000]   resurfaces the quotes.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.400]   Um, that's like, I think the basic level that does most of the good stuff to make sure I
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   got that.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.160]   If you scan the page of a physical book, look, I mean, Apple now has this live text, right?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.700]   You can just copy and paste the text, but this actually knows what book it is and we'll
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.100]   actually store that information also.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100]   I think so.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.220]   I think there may be an intermediate step where like it connects to your Amazon account
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.660]   and it therefore knows what book you own.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.220]   Um, and sometimes you have to like type in the name of the title or something, but like,
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220]   yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty magical when it works.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.820]   Um, there is an intermediate step when that particular thing doesn't work.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.820]   Okay.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.620]   Um, so that would be how I'd do the whole retention thing broadly.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.340]   I mean, the actual way of retaining anything is to find a way to use that information in
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.020]   your day-to-day life, maybe to create a piece of content or something or other based around
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.020]   that.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.300]   So if a book really, really resonates with me, I've got loads of highlights for it.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.380]   I will try and write a book summary or write like a tweet thread summary of a book or make
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.580]   a video about the book or interview the author of the book and talk to them about the book,
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.500]   just some kind of output that creates this tangible thing, which is a reason to actually,
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.100]   um, bother retaining the stuff because it's all well and good saying that like, Oh, like
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.100]   I have this all the time.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.420]   Like, Oh, I really want to like remember what's in this book, but if I'm not creating anything
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.820]   from it, it's, it's going to be hard beyond looking at my readwise email every day.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.100]   Um, so for me it's, it's easy cause I do videos about books and that helps me, helps me remember
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.900]   a lot of the things, uh, readwise also synchronizes to notion.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.940]   And so I've got a notion page that has literally everything I've ever highlighted in my life
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.640]   on Kindle or Instapaper or reader or pocket or any other app I've used to read books or
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.820]   read articles.
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.220]   And so if I ever need ideas for videos, I'll just look through my highlights and be like,
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   cool.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220]   That's a cool idea.
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.220]   That's from that book.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220]   All right, cool.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.060]   Let's piece things together and turn it into a video.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.940]   Nick Gray was on the show a couple of weeks ago, uh, and talked about friends newsletters.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.580]   So I'd say if you need a way to take the interesting content you're consuming, I can promise you
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.020]   that it's most people, at least I do from your newsletter, find interesting, Oh, here's
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.320]   this app I checked out, here's this book I read, here's this thing I found.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.300]   And so he proposed that everyone start a friends newsletter.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.260]   That's just, you know, send your emails, friends, an email, whether it's weekly, monthly, quarterly.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.980]   And I feel like that would be a great place to put this stuff and reinforce it, uh, which
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.980]   will help you remember it.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.980]   So nice.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.460]   There's, there's one tip from that episode.
