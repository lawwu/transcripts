[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.860]   From the first year of this podcast,
[00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.940]   we decided to address mature topics and awkward questions.
[00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.020]   No apologies about that.
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.780]   If you're comfortable asking us, we'll address it.
[00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.300]   So needless to say, today's question is a mature one
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.100]   for married couples.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.880]   The question arrives from men and from women.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.940]   Here are three representative emails I've picked out.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.740]   First, an anonymous wife writes in,
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.900]   "Pastor John, I have a question.
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.080]   "It's embarrassing, but here it is.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.120]   "My husband likes to use role-playing in the bedroom
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.080]   "and various levels of bondage and dominance.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.120]   "He wants me to say things like, 'I am your slave.'
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000]   "He wants me to wear certain colors around my neck.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.940]   "To the far extreme, he likes to fantasize
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.760]   "that he is raping me.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.380]   "But he's a very nice person outside of the bedroom.
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.920]   "He only asks if he can play out the fantasy in bed.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.560]   "What should I do?"
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.340]   Second, another anonymous wife writes in,
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.040]   "Dear Pastor John, thank you for the podcast.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.280]   "I have been married for 20 years.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.720]   "Before we got married, my husband told me
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.340]   "he had struggled with porn.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.120]   "After we were married, he asked me to try some
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.820]   "of the things he saw in the porn he had watched.
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.020]   "I consented.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.180]   "Our premarital counselor told us that anything
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.000]   "was okay in the marriage bed with mutual consent,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.420]   "and I wanted to please my husband.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.000]   "But this has had a detrimental effect on our marriage.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.540]   "I'm now to the point where I don't want
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.320]   "any physical intimacy, and he doesn't feel loved.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.760]   "Was it okay for us to do those things
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.860]   "since we agreed at the time?
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.240]   "I think dominance in the bedroom
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   "is completely anti-biblical.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.840]   "My husband continues to think it's fine
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   "with mutual consent."
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.200]   And third and finally, the question also arises
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.480]   from a husband.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   "Pastor John, my wife recently told me
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.800]   "she was unfaithful to me and hasn't had
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.580]   "an emotional connection with me in sex
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.280]   "or in general since we got married three years ago.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.420]   "She wants to engage in domineering sexual acts
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.040]   "that I see as sinful.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560]   "She thinks I'm too boring in bed.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.780]   "She now wishes to leave me so I can find a new wife
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.520]   "and so that she can engage in sexual experiences
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.500]   "with other men.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.440]   "How do I respond?"
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.000]   Pastor John, how would you respond to all three?
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   - Here are five perspectives on sexuality
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   that I hope will help couples get their bearings
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.840]   if they are willing to seriously seek God's will
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120]   for their sexual lives.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.120]   And I do promise that God's will for your sexual lives
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.600]   is the most satisfying way of life.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Number one, fantasizing sin is sin.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.560]   Playing out a situation or behavior in your mind
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.560]   because of its pleasure, which would be sinful,
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.360]   a sinful situation or sinful behavior
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.080]   if you did it outwardly, is sin in your mind.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.320]   And if this is true for fantasies,
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   then it is all the more true that play-acting sin is sin.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580]   Pretending to do something which,
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.680]   if you did it when not pretending is sin,
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.920]   that pretending is sin.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.200]   I say this because of Matthew 5, 27,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.600]   "You have heard that it was said
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.860]   "you shall not commit adultery,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.460]   "but I say to you that everyone who looks upon a woman
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.500]   "with lustful intent has already committed adultery
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.600]   "with her in his heart.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.360]   "If your right eye causes you to sin,
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940]   "tear it out and throw it away,
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.220]   "for it is better that you lose one of your members
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.240]   "than that your whole body be thrown into hell."
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.040]   In other words, Jesus' standard of holiness
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.900]   is not merely a standard of bodily deeds,
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.120]   but also of mental delights.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.220]   If you pursue a pleasure in your mind
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.800]   which is unlawful for your body, you are sinning.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.680]   What is sin?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   Think of it.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.880]   Sin is the heart's preference
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.440]   for anything above God and his ways.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.280]   Sin is not primarily the movement of the muscles
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.560]   or the body.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   It is primarily and fundamentally the movement of the soul,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.800]   the movement in pursuit of pleasure
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.920]   in a way that God has forbidden.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.160]   It's the failure to pursue pleasure
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.220]   in God himself above all else.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.880]   So it was an overstatement or a misstatement,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.760]   I'm not sure which the counselor would admit to,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.240]   it was an overstatement when the premarital counselor said
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.760]   that anything you mutually agree on
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.480]   in the marriage bed is permitted.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   If you mutually agree to play act a rape, it is sin.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.160]   If you mutually agree to pretend
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.080]   you are having sex in Times Square
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.520]   with a thousand people watching, it is sin.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.960]   If you mutually agree to pretend
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.280]   that you are two strangers
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.400]   who happened upon each other in the woods
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.560]   and have sex, you are sinning.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.760]   Fantasized sin is sin,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.040]   no matter how many people agree on it.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   Play acted sin is sin, Matthew 5, 27 to 28.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.200]   Number two, demanding or coercing unnatural
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.800]   and bizarre sexual acts
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.540]   when they displease the partner is sin.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.840]   Romans 12.10 says, "Outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.440]   Philippians 2.3 says, "Do nothing from selfish ambition
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.400]   or conceit, but in humility count others like the wife
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.320]   more significant than yourselves."
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.360]   1 Corinthians 6.19 says, "You are not your own.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.280]   You were bought with a price, so glorify God in your body."
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   All of that leads to the conclusion
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.920]   that in the marriage bed,
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.680]   the other person's desires and delights
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.520]   and disapprovals and displeasures
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   are as important as our own, indeed more so.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.880]   To press for your own private bodily satisfaction
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.920]   at the cost of the spouse's displeasure
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.840]   is a failure to honor,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.380]   a failure to count the other more significant,
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.720]   a failure to glorify God with your body,
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.800]   a failure to show you are not your own,
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.160]   but bought with a price belonging to Jesus.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.840]   If you need ever more kinky sex,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   ever more bizarre, unconventional sexual acts
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.960]   at the expense of your spouse's enjoyment,
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.960]   you are elevating your appetite above his or her delights.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   That's not the way of Christ.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.520]   Number three, if you pursue a sexual act
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   or an imagined sexual situation
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.820]   because it is more stimulating, scintillating, pleasurable,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.720]   because it is forbidden,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.560]   then you are living out the way of the fool
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.080]   and you are embodying the principle of bondage.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.080]   Proverbs 9.17 says, "To him who lacks sense,
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.240]   folly says, 'Stolen water is sweet.'"
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   If you pursue forbidden water
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.160]   because its prohibition makes it sweeter, you're a fool.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.040]   Paul got at the principle like this.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.280]   He said in Romans 7, "If it had not been for the law,
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.360]   I would have not known sin,
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.920]   for I would not have known what it is to covet
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.960]   if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   through the prohibition,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.360]   produced in me all kinds of covetousness."
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.200]   In other words, when you see a child
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.960]   have no interest in a toy until it is forbidden,
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.780]   you are watching bondage to a sinful nature.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.160]   So in the marriage bed,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.580]   to the degree that you pursue some act
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.360]   as more pleasurable because it is illicit,
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   you are in a fool's bondage to a sinful impulse.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   Number four, if sexual desire has become so prominent
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.320]   in the way you pursue satisfaction in life
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.420]   that you must push the limits of sexual conventions
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.000]   in order to be a joyful and contented person,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   your God and your purpose for living have become too small.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Bodily appetites become God's when God diminishes.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:33.880]   Sexual urges become too big
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.720]   when we lose big purposes for our lives.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3:18, "Beholding the glory."
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.120]   Now that's an infinitely beautiful thing
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.280]   he's just mentioned.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.160]   "Beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.640]   we are being changed into his image
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.480]   from one degree of glory to the next."
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   In other words, we need a big, beautiful, glorious,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.920]   transcendent, majestic vision of God
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.160]   and his purpose for our lives
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   if sex is to stay in its pleasurable small place.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.000]   Number five, finally, I would say to men,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   especially, if you hope to have a thrilling, joyful,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   mutually satisfying sexual relationship with your wife
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.040]   for the next 50 years,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.380]   you absolutely will not have it
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.380]   by demanding or expecting ever more bizarre exploits.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   Rather, you will have it by devoting 99% of your effort
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.080]   to love your wife well outside the bedroom
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.080]   so that she finds you somebody she really desires.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.600]   I don't promise paradise.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.360]   There's too much brokenness in the world,
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.440]   but I do promise you,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.120]   you will not find 50 years of mutual pleasure
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.040]   on the path of play-acted perversion.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.600]   - Wow, that ends with a punch.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.640]   You can ask questions, even sensitive ones like these.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.400]   Send them anonymously if you wish.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.120]   Just mention that you want it
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.360]   to remain anonymous in the emails,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.560]   and you can send those to us from the link
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.640]   at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.080]   Well, after a quarter of a century
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.520]   at Bethlehem Baptist Church,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.480]   Pastor John looked back and reflected
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.880]   on one of the most troubling trends
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.920]   he followed in Christianity.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.680]   It was the trend of self-esteem and self-love,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.760]   and he drew some conclusions about what it means for us
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.480]   in our love to others, and it's worth sharing.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.400]   Pastor John will explain that next time.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.280]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.980]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.040]   Thanks for listening.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
