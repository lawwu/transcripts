[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.940]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.400]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.500]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today, we are discussing colds and flus.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.480]   We will talk about what a cold really is
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.820]   and what a flu really is
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.000]   in terms of how they impact your brain and body.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.280]   And of course, we will discuss
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.320]   how to avoid getting colds and flus.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.960]   There are indeed some excellent science-supported techniques
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.880]   to avoid getting colds and flus,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.460]   but of course, it is impossible to completely avoid
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.000]   ever getting a cold or flu in your lifetime.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.040]   So we also discuss how to more quickly
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820]   get over a cold or flu should you happen to catch one.
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.000]   So during today's discussion,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.460]   I'll talk about the immune system.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.080]   I'll give you some mechanistic understanding
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.840]   of how your immune system works,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.400]   and I promise to make that discussion
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.100]   accessible to everybody,
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.640]   regardless of whether or not you have a background
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.520]   in biology.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.360]   And with that understanding of how your immune system works,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360]   you will be in a much better position
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.180]   to understand which tools,
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.440]   that is which protocols to implement,
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.720]   should you be exposed to a cold or flu,
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.320]   or if you are trying to get over a cold or flu
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   more quickly than you would otherwise.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080]   You'll learn about some potent behavioral tools
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.840]   for bolstering your immune system.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.320]   And we will also discuss various compounds
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.820]   that you might consider taking
[00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.920]   to enhance the function of your immune system
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.240]   to ward off or treat colds and flus.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.360]   I will also be dispelling a number of common myths
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.600]   about treatments for the common cold and for the flu.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240]   There are oh so many ideas out there
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.540]   about what one could take or do
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.800]   in order to avoid getting the cold or flu
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.340]   or more quickly get relief from a cold or flu.
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.080]   However, many of those are pure myth.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.700]   There's just no science to support them.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.040]   And indeed there's some science that counters those ideas.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.240]   But the good news is there are indeed
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.040]   science supported behavioral protocols
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.160]   and compounds that one could consider
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.440]   in order to avoid and treat colds and flus.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.080]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.880]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.280]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.840]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.440]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.480]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.200]   Our first sponsor is Juve.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.700]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.840]   Now, if there's one thing I've consistently emphasized
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.280]   on this podcast is the incredible role that light can have
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.480]   on our biology.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   And of course, I'm always telling people
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.560]   that they should get sunlight in their eyes
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.040]   as soon as possible after waking
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.500]   on as many days of their life as possible
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.840]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm, daytime mood focus
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.140]   and alertness and improve sleep.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.920]   Now, in addition to sunlight,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.240]   red light and near infrared light has been shown
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.680]   to have positive effects on improving numerous aspects
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.500]   of cellular and organ health,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.160]   including faster muscle recovery, improved skin health
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.560]   and wound healing, even improvements in acne,
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.520]   or that is removal of acne, reducing pain and inflammation,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.360]   improving mitochondrial function
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.920]   and even improving vision itself.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.880]   What sets Juve apart
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.440]   and why it's my preferred red light therapy device is
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.160]   that it has clinically proven wavelengths,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.960]   meaning it uses specific wavelengths of red light
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.200]   and near infrared light in combination
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.000]   that trigger the optimal cellular adaptations.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.160]   Personally, I use the handheld Juve every day.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.440]   The handheld Juve is about the size
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.880]   of a thick piece of toast.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.920]   And I also own a Juve panel that allows
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   for full body exposure.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.200]   And I use that one approximately five times per week
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.380]   for about 10 to 15 minutes per session.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.480]   If you'd like to try Juve,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.360]   you can go to Juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.180]   Again, that's juve.com/huberman.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.240]   For this month only, January, 2024,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.420]   Juve is offering exclusive discounts
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.940]   to Huberman Lab listeners
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.840]   with up to $500 off select Juve products.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.020]   Again, that's juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/huberman
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.040]   to get up to $500 off select Juve products.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.960]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.000]   that are tailored to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.040]   Now, sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.800]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.720]   When we are sleeping well and enough,
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.360]   mental health, physical health, and performance all stand
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.280]   to be at their best.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.240]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.360]   to make sure that your mattress is tailored
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.920]   to your unique sleep needs.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.000]   Helix Sleep has a brief two minute quiz
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.560]   that if you go to their website,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.840]   you take that quiz and answer questions such as,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.000]   do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.880]   your side of your stomach?
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.360]   Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.200]   Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.400]   and that's fine.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.880]   At the end of that two minute quiz,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.360]   they will match you to a mattress
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.320]   that's ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.840]   I sleep on the Dusk, a D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.860]   And when I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.560]   about two years ago, my sleep immediately improved.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.400]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.820]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.080]   take their two minute sleep quiz,
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.320]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.420]   And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.960]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.240]   Again, if interested, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.300]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.080]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.120]   Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.240]   that are the absolute highest quality.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.080]   I've spent a lifetime working on the biology
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.240]   of the visual system.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.320]   I can tell you that your visual system has to contend
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   with an enormous number of challenges
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.140]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.720]   Roka understands those challenges
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.640]   and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.040]   so that you always see with crystal clarity.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.160]   Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.380]   with a new technology called FloatFit,
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.120]   which allows them to fit perfectly
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.260]   and not move around even when you're active.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.440]   In fact, whenever I'm wearing my Roka eyeglasses
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.920]   or sunglasses, I usually forget that I'm wearing them.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.480]   I happen to wear Roka eyeglasses at night when I drive
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.720]   or if I'm reading at night,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.360]   and I wear Roka sunglasses during the daytime
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.200]   if it's very bright,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.840]   especially if I'm driving into sunlight.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.100]   If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.560]   you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.040]   and enter the code Huberman for 20% off your first order.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   Again, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.520]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.060]   Okay, let's talk about the common cold.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.800]   First off, no, unfortunately today,
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.340]   I cannot tell you the cure for the common cold
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.260]   because indeed there isn't one.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.620]   One interesting question, however,
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.360]   is why don't we have a cure for the common cold?
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.020]   And the reason is that the cold virus, as it's referred to,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.780]   is actually a bunch of different viruses.
[00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.800]   Some colds are caused by one,
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.900]   what's called serotype of the virus.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.820]   Other colds are caused by a different serotype of the virus.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.880]   There are over 160 different types
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.380]   of what people call the cold virus.
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.440]   Now, cold viruses fall under an umbrella
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.520]   of a general category of viruses called rhinoviruses.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.680]   You can remember that easily
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.000]   because rhino sounds like rhino's horn,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   the rhinoceros horn,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.960]   which is of course in the center of the rhino's face,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.080]   which is where your nose is.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.440]   And the cold almost always causes some degree
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.300]   of nasal symptoms in humans.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.040]   It's either runny nose or sneezing or stuffed up nose,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.740]   or sometimes unfortunately all three.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.640]   Now, the reason we don't have a cure for the common cold
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.000]   is that all of those different serotypes of the cold virus
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.360]   mean that the virus itself has a different shape
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.300]   on its outside.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.680]   And as a consequence, even if you've been exposed to a cold
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.820]   and you've developed antibodies against that cold virus,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.320]   the next cold that comes along
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.620]   very likely has a different shape,
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.940]   and therefore your body's antibodies
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.940]   to the cold virus it combated successfully before
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.860]   can't latch onto and defeat
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.000]   that next different serotype of the cold virus.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.840]   Now, a little bit later,
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.060]   I'll talk about the immune system
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.740]   and how those different antibodies are generated.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.180]   But for the time being,
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.020]   understanding that there are a lot of different types
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.380]   of cold viruses explains, first of all,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.700]   why we don't have a cure for the common cold,
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.860]   but also why you can get multiple colds
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.420]   within a given year or even within a given season.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.100]   Because even if you develop antibodies
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.420]   against one serotype of the cold virus,
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.900]   a different serotype can come along
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.220]   and you can get sick again
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.700]   with that new serotype of the cold virus.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.220]   So how do you catch a cold?
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.180]   Now, one of the problems with the cold virus
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.140]   being called the cold virus,
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.380]   and the fact that indeed there are more cold viruses present
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.100]   and transmitted between humans
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.220]   in the cold winter months of the year,
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.960]   is that people generally assume
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.100]   that it is the cold temperatures outside
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.820]   that actually give you a cold virus.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.580]   And that is simply not true.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.320]   However, what you heard as a kid,
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.020]   if your mom most likely, but maybe your dad said,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.380]   "Hey, don't go outside without a sweater or jacket on,
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.980]   you're going to catch a cold,
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.780]   or you're going to catch cold,"
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.320]   has propagated this myth
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.740]   that the cold temperatures themselves
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.940]   are the cause of catching a cold virus.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.500]   And that's simply not true.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.380]   The virus that we call the cold virus
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.620]   is spread by breathing, or by sneezing,
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.900]   or by people sneezing or coughing
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.780]   or breathing onto their hands,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.740]   and then touching surfaces,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.100]   and then other people touching those surfaces,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.020]   and then touching most likely their eyes
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.900]   in order to self-infect.
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.380]   Now, we're going to get into the details
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.660]   of how far the virus can spread with a sneeze,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.680]   how long it can survive on the hands, et cetera.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.620]   But for the time being, know this,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.480]   the cold virus is a pretty stable virus
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.620]   in that it can survive on surfaces,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.660]   non-human or human surfaces,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.080]   meaning skin or on a table or on a glass
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.640]   or on a door handle for up to 24 hours.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.740]   So for all you hypochondriacs out there,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.200]   I probably just gave you a little spike in cortisol.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.460]   And for you non-hypochondriacs,
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.720]   I hope what I just said cues you to the fact
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.780]   that just avoiding people who are sneezing and coughing
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.340]   is not sufficient to avoid getting colds and flus.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.260]   However, the fact that a cold virus
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.660]   is alive and well on a given surface,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.280]   let's say on a door handle,
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.340]   does not mean that if you touch that door handle
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.620]   that you will necessarily be infected with that cold virus.
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.040]   And that's because your skin
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.940]   actually provides an excellent barrier
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.740]   against most viruses and bacteria.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.080]   Your skin also includes a lot of antiviral substances on it.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.640]   Even if you haven't put any of that,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.580]   you know, alcohol stuff or the hand sanitizer stuff on,
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.880]   your skin is a very important barrier component
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.020]   of your immune system.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.020]   We're gonna talk about that a little bit later.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.060]   But if somebody has a cold
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.380]   and they happen to perhaps, you know, wipe their nose
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.540]   or sneeze into a tissue, hopefully into a tissue,
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.020]   and then discard that tissue,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.860]   the cold virus particles are extremely small.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.700]   How small?
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.200]   Well, most of us are familiar
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.140]   with thinking about centimeters or inches.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.420]   If you think about a millimeter
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.320]   being one one hundredth of a centimeter,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.940]   well, you can take a millimeter
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.740]   and you can divide that up
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.800]   into a bunch of little slices also,
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.520]   such that you get the micron.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.220]   The micron is one one thousandth of a centimeter.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.780]   And if you wanna get a sense of how thick or thin that is,
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.980]   the side of a credit card,
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.320]   the little thin side of a credit card,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.980]   is about 200 microns thick.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.340]   So if you set your credit card flat on a table
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.600]   and then you look at it from the side,
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.940]   that tiny, tiny, thin little edge,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.880]   that's about 200 microns.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.820]   The cold virus is made up of particles
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.460]   that are probably in the range of about five microns or so.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.920]   So it's extremely small.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.380]   I mean, the cold virus,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.340]   therefore, with a good sneeze or even a light sneeze,
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.100]   can spread really far.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.480]   Now, the good news is those particles are relatively heavy.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.940]   They don't tend to mist about in the air for very long.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.880]   They tend to fall down onto the ground or onto surfaces.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.820]   But as I mentioned before,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.820]   they can survive for a very long time on those surfaces.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.900]   So should you touch your hand to a door handle
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.520]   or table or shake the hand of somebody
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.020]   that has cold virus on their hands,
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.680]   either because they themselves have a cold
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080]   or they contacted somebody else that had cold virus
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   and it somehow landed on their hands
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.580]   just 'cause the other person sneezed.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.660]   All these scenarios are very realistic.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.180]   That cold virus will not infect you
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.400]   unless it can get inside of your body.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.040]   And one of the primary entry points
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.360]   of it getting inside your body is via the eyes,
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.900]   by wiping that cold virus on your eyes.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.960]   Now you may think, okay, I'm just not gonna touch my eyes.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.260]   But a little bit later, we're going to talk about a study
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:03.720]   that shows that almost always, indeed, almost always,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.780]   when you meet somebody new, you touch your eyes.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.280]   And the frequency of people touching their face,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.320]   that is the region of the face around the eyes
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.740]   and their eyes throughout the day is extremely high.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.060]   So this is one of the primary routes
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.640]   by which the cold virus is transmitted
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.020]   from one person to the next.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.740]   But of course, there's also the route
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.700]   that we're all familiar with,
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.980]   which is the person that is sneezing or coughing
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.440]   or blowing their nose into tissues
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.700]   and then throwing them in the trash
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.760]   and not washing their hands
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.220]   after each and every time they do that.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.900]   So an important aspect of today's discussion
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.400]   that we will get into once I also present to you
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.900]   what a flu is and how it differs from the cold,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.740]   is that we're going to need to talk about
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.600]   what stage of infection people are actually contagious
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.860]   with the cold or flu.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.000]   And there's actually a lot of mythology about this.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.180]   In fact, there's a lot of just lying about this.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.580]   People will be coughing or sneezing and they'll say,
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.280]   oh yeah, I'm not contagious any longer.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   Or people make up these things like,
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.760]   oh, you know, if you had the flu for two days,
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.020]   then you're no longer contagious.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.820]   Or that you can't be contagious until you have symptoms.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.920]   So we're going to go through all the aspects of contagion
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.200]   and how coughing or sneezing
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.300]   or how long you've had a cold or flu
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.880]   actually relates to whether or not
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.140]   you're contagious in a little bit.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.180]   But for the time being,
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.840]   know that the cold virus is very, very small.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.900]   It can be transmitted through the air.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.260]   It can be transmitted via contact,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.460]   from skin to skin contact,
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.180]   and it can survive on surfaces for up to 24 hours.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.520]   And when you touch those surfaces
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.780]   or a person with the cold virus,
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.180]   most often the way it's going to get into your body
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.640]   and infect you such that you get a cold
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.340]   is by touching your eye region.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.300]   Although touching other regions of your body
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.900]   can also pass the cold virus into you.
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.700]   For instance, the mouth and lips,
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.300]   but that's actually far less common.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.360]   So we'll get into that in just a little bit.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.780]   Now, different serotypes,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.880]   that is different types of cold virus,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.080]   tend to create a different array of overall symptoms
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.940]   such that, you know, one cold might be a really,
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.540]   quote unquote, bad cold.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.840]   Others are more mild.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.080]   Some tend to induce more runny nose,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.440]   others more stuffy head and a little bit of fever,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.360]   or in some cases, a lot of fever.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.480]   One thing that's important to understand
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.040]   is that if people are going to be infected
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.340]   by the cold virus,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.840]   they tend to develop symptoms one to two days
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.040]   after they were exposed to the virus.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.580]   Now, the good news is,
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.420]   if you are exposed to the cold virus,
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.040]   that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.360]   that you are going to catch that cold virus.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.520]   That is, if your immune system can fight off that cold,
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.920]   even if you've never been exposed to that serotype before,
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.940]   then you won't actually have that cold
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.220]   and you won't transmit it.
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.520]   So put differently,
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.740]   it is possible to avoid getting a cold virus
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.280]   even if you've never been exposed
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.760]   to that serotype of cold virus,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.000]   and you happen to come into contact with somebody
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.320]   who has that serotype of cold virus,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.660]   or you touch a surface of some object or handle, et cetera,
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.560]   that has a particular serotype of the cold virus on it,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.880]   and God forbid, you then wipe your eyes.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.440]   That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to get sick.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.040]   And a good portion of today's episode
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.800]   is going to focus on tools that are supported by science
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   that allow you to bolster your immune system
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.860]   and greatly increase the probability
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.400]   that even if you're exposed
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.200]   to a novel serotype of the cold virus,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.780]   that is one that's new to you,
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.340]   that your body's never seen before,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.720]   that you won't get sick.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.600]   Another thing to understand about the cold virus
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.320]   is that you're generally most contagious to other people
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.080]   when you feel at your worst.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.600]   That is when you're coughing and sneezing
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.820]   and you've got the stuffy head, watery eyes, and so on.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.200]   But you can also be contagious to other people
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.720]   when you are starting to feel better.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.900]   That said, most of the data point to the fact
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.760]   that about five to six days
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.380]   after you hit your peak of worst symptoms,
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.960]   or I guess we should say your nadir,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.140]   the dip of worst symptoms,
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.460]   'cause it's such an awful state to be in,
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.800]   you are probably exiting the phase in which you're contagious.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.240]   Now, I want to be very clear,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.700]   that does not mean that if you've had a cold
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.080]   for five or six days, that you are no longer contagious.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.620]   If you continue to experience sneezing and coughing,
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.800]   watery eyes, in the evening, you're feeling much worse,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.760]   first thing in the morning,
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.380]   you're feeling especially groggy, et cetera,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.280]   well, then you are still contagious.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.040]   Another way to frame this is, you know those people
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   that continue to show up at the gym and show up at work,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.240]   and they tell you, "Yeah, I got this cold,
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.160]   "but I've had it for a few days, I'm no longer contagious,"
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.020]   and they're wiping their eyes
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.720]   and they're blowing their nose.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.260]   Frankly, they don't know what they're talking about.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.440]   They are basically a walking, talking, breathing,
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.400]   sneezing, coughing, cold virus vector.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.880]   A vector is a route for passage of a virus.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.740]   So please, if you are sneezing, if you are coughing,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.680]   if you are still experiencing the symptoms of a cold,
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.560]   stay home, stay away from other people as much as possible.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.760]   And I realized that some people simply cannot avoid
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.360]   going to work or cannot avoid interacting
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.160]   with other family members or other people
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.520]   if they have the cold virus,
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.180]   but this mythology that if we've had a cold for a few days
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.380]   and we're starting to feel better,
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.620]   but we're still exhibiting symptoms
[00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.480]   that we're not contagious, that is pure myth.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.760]   It's simply not grounded, in fact.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.560]   Now, there's nothing that can be done
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.140]   about that first day or two
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.860]   after which we're exposed to a cold virus
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.380]   where we are not experiencing symptoms,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.060]   and it's quite possible to pass the cold virus
[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.900]   on to other people.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.940]   But I think that every workplace, every home environment,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.100]   every gym, every society would benefit greatly
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.340]   if people who were sick with the cold
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.100]   did not expose other people to that cold virus
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.580]   as much as possible.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.040]   And indeed, this is a serious issue.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.460]   It's not just about a few sniffles and watery eyes.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.420]   There's an enormous financial and mental health cost
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.300]   and physical health cost to people getting the cold.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.400]   And it's not just about people who are immune compromised
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.620]   or elderly people.
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.460]   What we're generally referring to as the cold today
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.360]   can be mild, it can be moderate,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.840]   it can also be very severe,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.560]   and it can exacerbate other health issues that people have.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.100]   And we'll talk about that a little bit later
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.860]   and how to offset some of those health issues.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.760]   Okay, so now let's talk about the flu virus.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.860]   The flu virus is, as I mentioned, a virus.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.320]   And just like with the cold,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.100]   there are different serotypes of the flu virus.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.100]   There are also different general categories of flu virus.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.840]   So you've got your A-type flu viruses,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.960]   your B-type flu viruses, and your C-type flu viruses.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.840]   And by the way, I'm saying flu viruses,
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.440]   but of course I'm referring to influenza,
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.880]   but it's just kind of commonplace nowadays
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.960]   to refer to influenza as the flu.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.580]   Similar to cold viruses,
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.680]   the different types of flu viruses
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.360]   exist based on the different types of proteins
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.200]   that they express on their surface.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   In fact, in the news over the last few years,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.100]   there have been a number of different flu virus strains
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.100]   that have been described
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.100]   according to their surface protein characteristics.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.600]   Things like the H1N1 virus.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.960]   What is H1N1?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.400]   H1N1 describes the different types of proteins
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.960]   that are expressed on the surface
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.020]   of that particular flu virus.
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.760]   Now, the most common type of flu viruses
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.180]   are in that A category of flus.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.880]   This is the type of flu that caused the Spanish flu.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.840]   Now, the Spanish flu,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.100]   which by the way, did not originate in Spain,
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.760]   people think it probably originated in New York
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.160]   or perhaps elsewhere, but certainly not in Spain,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   killed anywhere from 17 to 50 million people,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.480]   depending on which literature you read.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   That's an enormous number of people.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.840]   And it occurred in four different waves of infection
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.840]   that occurred between the years 1918 and 1920.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.360]   The Spanish flu was a type A H1N1 virus.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.200]   And actually, it's worth noting that this winter season,
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   there have been some cases of H1N1 already reported
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.080]   in the United States and elsewhere.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.480]   Now, of course, the goal is always to contain
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.020]   the propagation of those flu viruses.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.480]   And that is done through a number of different approaches.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.840]   The best and most reliable approach, of course,
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.040]   is to not come into contact with somebody
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.040]   that is carrying the H1N1 or any other type of flu virus.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.200]   However, based on the way that the flu virus
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.400]   infects the body, the way that the symptoms emerge,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   and the ways that viruses propagate,
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.180]   that can't always be avoided.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.640]   One thing to know, and I consider this a fortunate aspect
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.560]   of flu virus biology, is that the flu virus,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.200]   unlike the cold virus, can only exist on surfaces
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.840]   for about two hours.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.200]   After about two hours, it tends to die off.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.320]   So the flu virus is most typically passed
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.280]   by human-human contact, or coming into contact
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.780]   that is walking into a cloud of somebody's sneeze
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.320]   that contains flu virus, or somebody's cough
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.840]   that contains flu virus.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.180]   And yes, it is possible that shaking someone's hand
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.760]   could actually introduce flu virus to your hand,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.400]   and then if you wipe your eyes,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.800]   or I'll talk about a few other portals of entry
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.200]   for the flu virus and cold virus in a few minutes,
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.800]   can get into your body and infect you.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   And yes, you can pick up the flu virus from surfaces.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.560]   However, that is far less common
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.600]   than the flu virus passing from human-human contact.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.240]   Now, there aren't as many different types of flu virus
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.880]   as there are types of cold virus,
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.740]   and that's why there have been attempts
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.540]   at making flu vaccines, or so-called flu shots.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.240]   I think most people are familiar with the signs
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.480]   and advertisements online and in the workplace
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.240]   and school saying, "Get your flu shot this season."
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.520]   The reason that flu shots can exist at all
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.120]   is because there are limited enough types of flu virus
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.240]   present in a given year that specific vaccines,
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.160]   that is flu shots, can be generated
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.440]   against that particular strain of the flu virus.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.520]   So how effective is the flu shot?
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.420]   And I want to be very specific here.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.760]   When we say the flu shot, singular,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.700]   it sort of implies that there's one flu shot
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.360]   that can combat all the different types of flu.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.480]   And as you just learned, that is not the case.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.520]   So we probably should be saying the flu shots,
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.220]   but just for sake of simplicity, when I say the flu shot,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.240]   I mean the flu shot that's given in a given flu season
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   that is directed at specific strains of the flu,
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.760]   because researchers have determined
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:38.640]   that that particular strain of flu or strains of flu
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.440]   are the ones that are most abundant
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.360]   for that particular flu season.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   Studies have shown that getting the flu shot
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.640]   reduces one's risk of contracting the particular flu
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.040]   that is most abundant that season by about 40 to 60%.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.760]   But of course, the flu shot is completely ineffective
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.300]   at combating any other forms of the flu virus,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.080]   and of course, colds or other types
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.900]   of upper respiratory infections.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.220]   Studies have also shown that taking the flu shot
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.440]   can reduce the severity of one's symptoms
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.960]   if they in fact get the flu anyway.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.880]   Now, personally, I don't typically get the flu shot.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.940]   And the reason for that is that I don't tend
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.960]   to go into environments where I am particularly susceptible
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.080]   to getting the flu.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.200]   I don't work in a hospital or a clinic.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.240]   I don't tend to interact with large numbers of people
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.620]   on a daily basis.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.320]   So for me, I've opted not to get the flu shot.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.160]   Now, that doesn't mean that I've never contracted the flu.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.420]   As I mentioned earlier, I tend to get sick
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.180]   with a cold or flu about once every 18 to 24 months.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.080]   And the severity of that colder flu has ranged from,
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.900]   you know, at one point, a very high fever in one case,
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.780]   but typically a moderate fever
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.580]   and the usual symptoms of malaise
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.900]   that we've been discussing.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.460]   And I've managed to get over those
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.860]   without having taken the flu shot pretty easily.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.760]   Now, of course, we also don't know
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.620]   that those were actually flus.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.920]   Despite the distinct differences
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.240]   between the symptoms of cold and flu,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.620]   most people don't really know
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.640]   whether or not they have a cold or flu.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.140]   So this is another thing to think about
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.520]   when considering whether or not to get the flu shot.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.980]   Ultimately, because at least to my knowledge,
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.080]   most workplaces do not mandate that people get the flu shot.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.880]   I could be wrong about certain workplaces,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.240]   but my experience is that most workplaces do not mandate
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.920]   that people get the flu shot.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.140]   When you take the flu shot, you're really hedging a bet.
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.580]   You're hedging a bet against the fact
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.140]   that you will be or not be exposed
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.560]   to that particular strain of flu virus
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.100]   that's most abundant that season
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.140]   or strains of flu virus that are most abundant that season,
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.340]   and that the flu shot that you're taking
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.900]   is directed at those particular strains.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.460]   So again, in my case, I don't tend to take the flu shot,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.060]   but of course you need to make the decision
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.360]   that's right for you.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.180]   For instance, if you have family members
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.060]   that are immune compromised, or you work in a school,
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.080]   or you think that you are exposed to a lot of flus,
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.020]   or you're concerned about transmitting flu
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.620]   to any one individual or group of individuals,
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.140]   those are all things that need to be taken
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.280]   into consideration, and of course, speak to your physician.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.560]   I will also say this, which is that I mentioned
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.500]   that I've tended to catch colds or flus
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.860]   at a rate of about once every 18 to 24 months.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.420]   And when I say a cold or flu, I mean a serious one,
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.220]   one that keeps me in bed where I have a fever
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.060]   and I'm sweating.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.700]   What I have done and I continue to do
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.180]   is because I pay pretty close attention
[00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.520]   to how well I'm sleeping or different life events,
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.980]   my different workouts, et cetera,
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.340]   and I put those into my calendar
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.620]   and I have a shorthand to do that,
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.600]   so it only takes about 30 seconds each day.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.640]   Okay, did this work out?
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.900]   It was kind of level seven out of 10 intensity.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.740]   Got good sleep last night or poor sleep,
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.060]   and I know what good and poor sleep is for me.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.100]   I mean, that's about the level
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.300]   that I'm charting these things.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.240]   I have been able to go back and look at the events
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.620]   preceding when I've come down with a cold or flu.
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.540]   Again, I don't know whether or not it was a cold or a flu,
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.940]   but before I got sick, and I've seen, for instance,
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.820]   like if I've ever done two hard workouts in a day,
[00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.780]   something I never do any longer,
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.540]   I've tended to get sick after that.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.100]   If I've tended to do hard workouts
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.860]   and then expose myself to cold temperatures while traveling,
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.420]   especially traveling overseas,
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.380]   that tended to precede those colds or flus,
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.100]   which again, for me, are very seldom.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.280]   So it's a limited data set.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.180]   This is entirely anecdotal,
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.300]   meaning related to my own history of getting colds or flus,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.380]   but it's something that I actually recommend people do,
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.660]   which is to pay attention
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.260]   to when you first started getting symptoms,
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.740]   pay attention to when you got over
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.860]   a given what you think is a cold or flu,
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.280]   and then to look at what was happening
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.060]   in the days before in that day.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.500]   I don't think it's possible to do hyper precise forensics
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.760]   on a cold or flu, right?
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.660]   I mean, you could have gone into the gas station,
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.660]   put your credit card in the machine
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.580]   to grab a drink out of the refrigerator
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.580]   and picked up a cold or flu
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.300]   from the handle of the refrigerator
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.860]   or from the credit card machine,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.980]   or even from the gas pump.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.400]   You simply don't know.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.260]   However, if you look at the pattern of behavior,
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.420]   travel, sleep, exercise,
[00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.820]   sorts of interactions you were having
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.180]   prior to getting a bad cold or flu,
[00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.000]   chances are you're gonna learn something interesting
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.780]   and be able to avoid getting a serious cold or flu,
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.080]   at least to some extent going forward.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.920]   And I've done that, I think fairly successfully
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.380]   because I can tell you
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.900]   that the frequency of colds or flus
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.180]   that I've come down with
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.140]   has indeed been dropping from year to year.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.300]   So whereas a decade ago,
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.340]   I tended to get colds or flus probably about once a year,
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.180]   and in some cases even twice a year,
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.820]   although that was pretty rare,
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.900]   that really expanded to about once every 18 months.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.540]   And then in the last five years,
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.740]   I think I've gotten sick two times pretty badly
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.740]   with a cold or flu,
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.300]   and then once with a kind of mild cold or flu.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.420]   So I tell you all that just as an example
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.660]   of how you can start to think about
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.200]   how your immune system interacts
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.080]   with different types of behaviors,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.940]   different types of situations,
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.380]   such that you can learn something about your immune system
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.180]   and what's going to best protect you
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.180]   against getting colds and flus going forward,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.860]   which of course is a great thing to do
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.100]   because we all think that we can get out there,
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.780]   be around people that are coughing and sneezing.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.580]   We can go to the gym when it's crowded in winter.
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.680]   Oh, that person over there is coughing,
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.220]   but I'm going to just stay a few feet away, no big deal.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.900]   And while I don't want to turn anyone into hypochondriacs,
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.380]   that's how you get infected.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.520]   That's how you get a cold or flu.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.580]   And at the same time,
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.860]   I don't think anyone should get to the point
[00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.620]   where they're afraid to go into a gym
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.080]   or afraid to go to the workplace.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.560]   But I will say once again,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.820]   if you're sick with a cold or flu,
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.980]   if you are coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose,
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.760]   runny eyes, and you're walking into work
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.940]   or the gym or onto public transportation,
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.560]   and you're telling people I'm not contagious, you're lying.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.940]   I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.920]   and thank one of our sponsors, and that's AG1.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.540]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.820]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.940]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.200]   The reason I started taking it
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.980]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.360]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.140]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.980]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.500]   to support gut health.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.960]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.940]   we realized is not just important
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:48.780]   for the health of our gut, but also for our immune system
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.940]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.500]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.460]   In other words, gut health is critical
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.320]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.020]   Now, of course, I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.440]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.400]   but there are a number of things in AG1,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.100]   including specific micronutrients
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.660]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.540]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.940]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.700]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens,
[00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.740]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.300]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.440]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.560]   what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.860]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.060]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.580]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.720]   and you'll get a year's supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.820]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.720]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.920]   Now, the diabolical thing about the flu virus
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.840]   is that just like the diabolical thing about the cold virus,
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.340]   you start shedding virus, that is you are contagious,
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.900]   about 24 hours prior to the onset of first symptoms for you.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.140]   So that means that you can be a flu viral vector
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.740]   even when you aren't having symptoms.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.440]   That's just the unfortunate aspect of these viruses.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.280]   They're very clever.
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.980]   They don't have brains, but these viruses have adapted
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.620]   to propagate from host to host to host.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.340]   They have a drive to continue to stay alive
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.260]   and to infect more hosts.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.780]   So even though they don't have a brain,
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.100]   they have a sort of, let's call it viral intelligence.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.600]   And as I've said several times now,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.340]   if you are still exhibiting symptoms of the cold or flu,
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.100]   you are contagious.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.940]   However, with respect to the flu,
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.860]   you are most contagious during the three days
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.580]   when you feel the absolute worst,
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.480]   when your fever is at its worst.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.580]   We'll talk about how to deal with fever a little bit later.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.140]   When you are coughing and sneezing, headache, all of that,
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.720]   when that is at its peak,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.460]   that is when you are most contagious.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.780]   So again, I realized that people can't always avoid contact
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.720]   with other people, you know, you live under the same roof,
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.420]   caretakers interacting with the person
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.500]   that has the cold or flu.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.960]   And I do want to remind you something I said earlier,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.840]   which is just because you come into contact
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.040]   with a cold or flu does not necessarily mean
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.640]   that you will come down with that is be infected
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.960]   by a cold or flu.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.200]   Whether or not you come down with a cold or flu
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.840]   is of course dependent on whether or not
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.040]   you come into contact with it.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.280]   You can't catch a cold or flu
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:17.600]   that you've never come into contact with,
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.080]   just like you can't get eaten by a shark
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.400]   if you never go in the ocean.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.320]   However, the probability of coming down
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.160]   with that cold or flu,
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.360]   of it getting past your immune system barriers
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.560]   and infecting you is going to be strongly dictated
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.400]   by the different aspects of your immune system
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.800]   for which there are three major aspects,
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.200]   which we'll talk about next.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.340]   And of course, the things that you do
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.240]   to bolster those three aspects of your immune system.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.400]   Okay, let's talk about your immune system.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.440]   And I have to confess that even though I've spent
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.560]   well over three decades being a student of and researcher
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.080]   of the nervous system, the immune system is oh so cool.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.600]   And I say that because it has this incredible elegance
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.720]   and logic to it.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.180]   It basically consists of three major lines of defense.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.720]   There's a physical barrier or rather a set
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.540]   of physical barriers that exist between the organs
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.480]   of your body and the outside world.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.640]   And you're probably immediately thinking skin.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.880]   And yes, indeed, it includes your skin,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.680]   but also some interesting things like the mucosal lining
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.260]   of your nose and mouth, and even some of the liquids
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.020]   that are on the surface of your eyes.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.540]   We'll talk about those in a moment.
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.640]   Then there's a second line of defense,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.300]   which is for any virus or bacteria or fungus
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.360]   for that matter, but today we're talking about viruses,
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.880]   cold and flu viruses.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.180]   Any viruses that get past the physical barrier of your skin
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.460]   and the mucosal lining of particular regions of your body,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.060]   well then you have what's called the innate immune system.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.780]   The innate immune system is this very generalized
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.960]   response system.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.760]   It's general in the sense that it deploys a basic set
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.360]   of neurochemicals that are not specific
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.840]   to the particular virus that's made it into your body.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.820]   So not only is it not specific to a particular serotype
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.920]   of the cold or a different type of flu virus,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.840]   but it's not even discriminating between cold or flu virus.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.900]   This thing we call the innate immune system
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.140]   is a generalized response system to go and combat viruses.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.600]   So it could be a cold, it could be a flu,
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.640]   it could be a bacteria, it could be a fungus,
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.180]   it could even be a physical object,
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.340]   and your innate immune system responds by saying,
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.740]   "Okay, let's go deal with this."
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.440]   Now, the third component of your immune system
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.480]   is what's called the adaptive immune system,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.440]   and I alluded to this aspect of your immune system
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.540]   a little bit earlier.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.660]   The adaptive immune system is the aspect
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.560]   of your immune system that recognizes,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.820]   because the innate immune system told it,
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:35.060]   that something has infected the body at some level,
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.660]   at some organ or set of organs, and there's an emergency.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.140]   And the adaptive immune system goes in
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.260]   and in a very targeted way, figures out what sorts
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.300]   of proteins it needs to produce, that is antibodies,
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.260]   to combat that specific serotype of virus.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.500]   Okay, so the immune system has a physical barrier component,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.340]   and it's not just skin, some other things as well.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.160]   You've got your innate immune system,
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.940]   which is this generalized response system,
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.980]   and then there's the adaptive immune system.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.540]   Let's talk about the physical barrier component first.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.900]   And this is actually a good opportunity
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.660]   for us to just take a brief step back and realize
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.500]   that anytime we're talking about our physiology,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.020]   there's going to be a mechanical set of features,
[00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.620]   and there's going to be a chemical set of features.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.480]   So right now we're talking about the immune system,
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.860]   and the mechanical feature, or the physical feature
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.020]   of the immune system, is this barrier
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.600]   between the organs of our body and the outside world.
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.100]   And the most obvious of those is the skin.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.140]   You are contained in this bag of stuff that we call skin.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.940]   The skin isn't just for putting clothing on
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.460]   and for adorning with jewelry or tattoos,
[00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.180]   if that's your thing, watches, et cetera.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.180]   Your skin is a living organ in and of itself.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.820]   I think we're most accustomed to thinking about the heart
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.060]   and the lungs and the liver and the brain
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.140]   as organs of the body, but the skin is an organ
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.420]   of the body as well.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.000]   It has a bunch of different layers of cells
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.840]   from the outside to the inside.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.300]   Actually, the skin cells themselves are made
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.400]   in the deeper layers of the skin,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.440]   and they migrate out towards the surface of the skin,
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.720]   and at the surface of the skin, on top of those cells
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.280]   and made by those cells are different types of chemicals
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.780]   that actually serve as antibacterial and antiviral agents,
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.100]   meaning if a cold virus or flu virus
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.880]   or other type of virus lands on the skin,
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.420]   it can neutralize and kill that virus.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.500]   So your skin is a very important physical barrier
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.740]   against viruses such as the cold or flu virus
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.140]   getting into your body and infecting other cells and tissues.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:27.160]   Now, your skin is not contiguous,
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.800]   meaning there are holes in it.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.900]   So let's think about those holes for a second.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.560]   As we go from head to foot, it's pretty obvious
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.040]   that your eyes have these two openings,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.740]   and those are openings in your skin, right?
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:45.040]   As you open your eyelids, beneath there are your corneas,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.180]   the shiny part of your eyes,
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.540]   and then a little bit further back,
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.680]   at the back inner lining of your eyeball,
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.320]   you have a very thin three-cell layer thick piece of tissue
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.520]   that we call the neural retina.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.260]   And I say this because the neural retina
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.900]   is actually a piece of your brain.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.080]   So you have two pieces of brain
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.360]   that line the back of your eyes,
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.640]   and that's the light sensing tissue
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.480]   in the back of your eyes.
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.800]   Now, I say this because what this means
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.820]   is that it's a very short distance
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.160]   between the opening of your skin
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.420]   that we call your eyelids and your brain.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   Now, most of the brain, of course,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.920]   is contained in the cranial vault
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.220]   within what most people call the skull,
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.000]   but your brain isn't far away
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.640]   from those openings that we call your eyelids.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.840]   So as a consequence, on the surface of your eyes,
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.560]   those corneas, the shiny part of your eyes on the outside,
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.960]   there are a bunch of different chemical features.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.040]   There are tears that are made by your lacrimal glands,
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.760]   but there are also a lot of antibacterial agents
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.840]   that actively kill off stuff
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.600]   that could potentially infect your body,
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.400]   could make it into your body, maybe even into your brain.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.720]   If you've ever woken up in the morning
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.600]   and you have some crust on your eyes,
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.840]   and you look at that crust, that kind of yellowy stuff,
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.360]   sometimes it's yellow, I know this is kind of gross,
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.600]   that's actually dead bacteria that your eyes have successfully
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.000]   defeated during your night's sleep.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:53.920]   So when you wipe those away,
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.000]   you're taking the casualties of a war
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.400]   that you won during your night's sleep,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.680]   and you're whisking those away.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.000]   Now, as we descend a little bit further down the face,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.720]   there are, of course, the nostril openings,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.280]   and the nostril openings tend to be kind of sticky, right?
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.920]   They're moist, sticky, and warm.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.440]   You don't have to put your fingers up them right now,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.280]   you just know they're moist, sticky, and warm.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.000]   Get your fingers out of your nose, please.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.560]   The mucosal lining of your nose
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.840]   is actually a very important substance
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.200]   that is sticky in order to trap viruses
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.680]   such as colds and flu viruses,
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.120]   and then chemical components
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.320]   within the mucosal lining can neutralize them.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.520]   That's the best case scenario.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.800]   There are, of course, scenarios in which the cold
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.200]   or flu virus takes residence in your mucosal lining
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.520]   and it can make its way back into your sinus passages
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.360]   and can then infect other cells and tissues of your body
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.080]   because the virus replicates and spreads throughout the body.
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   And then going a little bit further down,
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.880]   I realize this is obvious, you have your mouth.
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.800]   And what's really interesting is that your mouth
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.000]   also has mucosal lining, which is sticky,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.320]   and it has chemical components
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.120]   to neutralize incoming viruses.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.380]   But we know that the type of mucus
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.360]   and the type of bacteria that live in your nose and mouth
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.040]   that, by the way, are very healthy for you
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.600]   and encourage healthy immune system function,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.360]   that is, act as ways to neutralize viruses
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.720]   within your nose and mouth, are very different.
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.200]   So your nose and your mouth,
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.040]   they seem similar at the level of,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.440]   okay, well, it's warm and sticky in there, there's mucus,
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.600]   but they are very, very different tissues.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.440]   In fact, if you think about your mouth,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.600]   it's this incredible structure that not only lets you eat
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.840]   and breathe in and out through,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.160]   although I suggest most people be nasal breathers
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.800]   for most of the time of their day and night, if you can.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.340]   Of course, sometimes you have to mouth breathe.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.800]   But keep this in mind,
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.240]   you have this big opening in the front of your face
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.320]   and bacteria are getting in there all day long.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.880]   Viruses are getting in there all day long.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.760]   And in most cases,
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.600]   you are successfully combating those viruses and bacteria
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.200]   because the mucosal lining of your mouth
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.360]   and your nose for that matter, and the microbiota,
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.480]   those little microorganisms that have taken residence
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.680]   in your nose and mouth are helping to contribute
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.560]   to fight off bacteria and viruses,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.640]   provided the microbiota there are diverse
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.840]   and are of the type you want,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.360]   which we'll talk a little bit more about later.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.880]   And then descending further down the body,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.000]   of course, there are other openings into your skin barrier,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   namely the urethra of the penis or vagina,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.040]   and of course the vaginal canal.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.960]   So the genitals, of course, have their own mucosal lining.
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.780]   And as you can imagine,
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.560]   it is distinct in terms of its physical makeup
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.760]   and its chemical makeup from the mucosal lining
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.280]   of your nasal passages and mouth.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.360]   And then of course we have the rectum and anus,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.200]   which is the outflow pathway of your intestines,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.320]   which are post-digestive.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.240]   And there too, you have a mucosal lining for which,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.360]   yes, certain types of viruses and bacteria
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.540]   can infect that area.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.780]   But what we know is that the primary entry sites,
[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.800]   the most common ways in which colds and flus
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:47.960]   get into your body,
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.640]   the way they breach that physical barrier
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.040]   that we call your skin,
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.240]   is through your eyes, your nose, or your mouth.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.040]   And there are a lot of data, some of which conflict,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.900]   and frankly, there need to be more data
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.400]   in order to really resolve this,
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.840]   but it seems like the primary entry site
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.320]   for viruses to get into the body
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.140]   tends to be the eyes or the mouth.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:09.500]   And we can get into some of the reasons
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.780]   why that would be so.
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.280]   But if you think back to our conversation
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.780]   about the way that colds and flus exist in the world,
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.940]   either as aerosols or on surfaces of objects
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.440]   or on surfaces of skin,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.180]   well then what I'm about to tell you next
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.540]   will make it oh so obvious why the eyes and the mouth
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.840]   are the primary sites of entry for colds and flus.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.200]   And if you keep that in mind, there's a good chance
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.140]   you can avoid a lot of colds or flus
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:33.940]   that you would otherwise catch.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.980]   Okay, so before I talk about the important roles
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.160]   of the innate and the adaptive immune system
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.220]   in keeping colds and flus at bay,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.140]   I'll tell you that you have a problem.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:47.780]   And that problem is that you tend to touch your eyes
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.660]   very often.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.120]   In fact, you tend to touch your eyes most often
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.860]   after you shook somebody else's hand.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.540]   Now, why am I picking on you?
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.700]   Well, in fact, I'm not.
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.780]   I'm picking on all of you and I'm picking on myself included
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.120]   because there have been several studies now,
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.340]   primarily from Noam Sobel's lab at the Weizmann Institute
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:10.680]   showing that when people encounter another person
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.720]   and they shake their hand, they either touch their eyes
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.920]   or touch another region of their face
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.580]   very close to the eyes
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.860]   or that they touched their hand to their mouth.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.820]   Now, there are a bunch of theories as to why people do this.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.800]   There's the idea that people are actually sniffing
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.100]   their own hand and in particular sniffing their own hand
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.320]   more often after they shake someone else's hand
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.100]   as a way to detect what chemo signals
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.220]   exist on the other person,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.380]   not necessarily conscious smelling
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.900]   of the other person's smell,
[00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.900]   but rather some sort of unconscious mechanism
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.220]   by which we take the chemicals
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.140]   of the person we come into contact with
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.500]   and we bring them to our nose, our eyes,
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.260]   or in some cases our upper lip.
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.720]   And that our olfactory system, that is the neurons
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.740]   that exist just behind the back of our nose
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.160]   are processing that information
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.340]   and getting all sorts of important information
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.180]   about how stressed the other person is,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.900]   their hormones, whether or not we recognize them,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.820]   the fact that they are different from us, that's right.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.500]   We are also smelling ourselves all day long.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:12.620]   Noam's lab has shown this,
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.800]   that people are kind of walking around
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.540]   in their own odor cloud.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.020]   We tend to touch our armpits.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.740]   We tend to touch different aspects of our body, yes,
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.380]   and smell ourselves multiple times throughout the day.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.340]   This is all being done unconsciously.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.020]   I suppose some people are doing it consciously.
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.120]   And that there's a lot of information
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.300]   about our physiology and health.
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.440]   And when we do this after shaking somebody's hand,
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.180]   that there's a lot of information
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.820]   about the other person's physiology and health,
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.120]   that our nervous system, our olfactory system
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.900]   and deep parts of our brain
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.500]   that are involved in primitive type behaviors,
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.380]   but also some pretty sophisticated behaviors
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.700]   are taking into account.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.180]   Now, Noam Sobel was a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.620]   I encourage you to check out that episode if you have time.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.780]   It's a fascinating voyage into the olfactory system
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.720]   and not just conscious smelling or sniffing of things.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.020]   So we go, oh, that smells good, or that smells bad,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.660]   or that person is somebody I want to mate with
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.180]   or hang out with or avoid.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.860]   It's also unconscious processing
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.880]   of so-called chemo signals, chemical signals.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.540]   But the reason I'm bringing up these studies now
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.900]   in the context of colds and flus
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.060]   and how to avoid getting colds and flus
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.900]   is as a reminder that we are pretty much wired
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.300]   to contact our own face with our own hands
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.540]   at the level of our eyes, nose, and upper lip
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:28.260]   and around the eyes very shortly
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.240]   after we touch somebody else's skin.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.100]   And if you are mindful of it,
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.000]   you can actually avoid bringing colds or flus to your face.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.640]   Now, in doing so, or you're going to short circuit
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.220]   a bunch of other important biological processes involved
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.660]   in understanding what's going on in your environment
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.780]   because you're not bringing in those smells,
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.840]   I suppose that's possible.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.980]   But with respect to avoiding colds and flus,
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.600]   it seems like a pretty good trade off to me.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.900]   So the point that I'm trying to make here
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.260]   is that in order for you to catch a cold or flu,
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.780]   that cold or flu virus, the little particles
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.500]   of cold and flu virus need to make it into your body.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.540]   And the primary entry sites are eyes, nose, mouth,
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.300]   and the primary actions by which we bring colds
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.420]   and flu viruses to our eyes, nose, mouth
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.340]   are by touching other people or by touching other surfaces
[00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.960]   that have cold or flu virus.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.980]   Just to remind you, cold virus can exist
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.540]   up to 24 hours on a given surface.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.740]   Flu virus tends to die off
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.140]   after about two hours on a given surface.
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.860]   And we're bringing that to our face.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.340]   We are literally bringing the virus to ourselves.
[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.480]   So a little bit more conscious awareness about that fact
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.780]   means that you can probably avoid colds and flus
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.620]   to some extent.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.440]   How much?
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.220]   Well, it's unclear.
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.560]   It's unclear because as you recall,
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.620]   some people have and are passing along cold or flu virus
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.340]   prior to any symptoms.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.140]   And of course, it's possible that you can walk
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.540]   into an aerosol cloud of cold or flu virus
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.780]   even if a person isn't there
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.100]   and you don't come into contact with them.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.340]   But some conscious awareness of these routes of passage
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.460]   for the cold or flu virus,
[00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:00.260]   I do believe can reduce the probability
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.020]   that you will catch a cold or flu.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:04.420]   And of course, I'm not encouraging people to never touch.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.740]   Touch is an important part of social connection
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.220]   and social bonding.
[00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.100]   But if you start to think about these portals of entry
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.380]   for the cold and flu virus into your body,
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.840]   well, then you perhaps might think twice
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.260]   before hugging someone, kissing them on the cheek
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.380]   during a time in which you're trying to actively avoid
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.060]   getting the cold or flu.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.340]   Now, I feel a little bit funny about sharing this information
[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.180]   because again, I don't want to encourage people
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.900]   to always be at arms distance, fake fist bumping,
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.100]   keeping a gap between them.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.920]   Again, touch is an important component of social connection.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.020]   But since today's topic is colds and flus
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.180]   and how to avoid getting colds and flus,
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:40.320]   just like you can't get eaten by a shark
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.020]   if you don't go in the ocean,
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.500]   there's a much lower probability
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.180]   that you're going to get a cold or flu
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.200]   if you're not touching a lot of hands
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:51.360]   and bringing those hands to your eyes, nose or mouth.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.800]   I suppose one way around the sort of do I hug,
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.920]   do I shake hands thing is to just be conscious of the fact
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.080]   that when you shake somebody's hand
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.760]   that you're very likely to touch your eyes or face
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   within the next 30 seconds or so.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.320]   And maybe you end up being that person
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.440]   who puts some hand sanitizer on your hands.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.680]   Sometimes that can feel a little awkward
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.880]   to do that right in front of somebody.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.000]   You know, it's kind of sending a signal like,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   hey, I don't want you to infect me, but guess what?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.520]   You don't want them to infect you.
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.400]   Okay, let's imagine that a cold or flu virus
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.500]   makes it into your system.
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.720]   It breaches the physical barrier of your skin
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.520]   and mucosal lining.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.360]   Now, you have in mind all the different ways
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.760]   that could happen and all the different ways
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.580]   that could be prevented.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.280]   But we are starting at a point here, a hypothetical point
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.720]   whereby that cold or flu virus has made it into your body.
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.900]   Your immune system has an absolutely
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:40.580]   exquisitely sophisticated way of knowing you versus other,
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:44.320]   meaning cells within your body that are of you
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.120]   and cells of your body that are from other organisms
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.680]   or viruses from the outside world.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.480]   And when viruses such as a cold or flu virus
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.980]   are detected in your body,
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.660]   your body might not even recognize
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.240]   that it's a cold or flu virus.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.640]   It might not even recognize that it's a virus at all.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.640]   It just knows that this thing that's in me is of other.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.760]   It's not me.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   I've never seen it before.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.840]   This is not me.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.860]   These are not my cells.
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.000]   These are not the chemicals that I'm producing.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.440]   And your immune system is amazing in that way.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.700]   And when it occurs,
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.400]   your innate immune system launches a response.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.600]   What is that response?
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.100]   Well, first of all, the response is very rapid, right?
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.900]   Cold or flu makes it into your body
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.720]   and your innate immune system immediately
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.200]   or near immediately launches an attack
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.820]   on that invader or invaders.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.600]   Because as soon as the virus gets into your body,
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.240]   it's going to start replicating as quickly as it can.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.180]   What happens?
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:46.740]   White blood cells that your body produces
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:49.620]   will go to the sites where those viruses are.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:52.540]   And by the way, those viruses are basically
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.040]   getting into cells of your body
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:57.100]   and then hijacking the genetic machinery of those cells
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.220]   in order to replicate within those cells
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.880]   and then exit those cells and then go infect more cells.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.140]   That's how these viruses work.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.780]   Your body's making white blood cells,
[00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:11.020]   things like neutrophils, natural killer cells, macrophages.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.120]   These are what we call effector cells
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.100]   that act as a kind of ambulance system
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.420]   and go to the sites that those viruses exist
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.100]   and the cells that they've infected
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.740]   and start trying to physically barrier them in
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.380]   and also use specific chemical mechanisms
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.460]   to neutralize and kill those viruses.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.300]   Again, anytime you're thinking about biology,
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.200]   think of mechanical features
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.620]   and chemical features of a response.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:36.700]   Now, a key component of the innate immune system
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.560]   is what's called the complement system.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.360]   Not complement like, oh, you look very nice today,
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.420]   but complement, okay, the complement system,
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.400]   which exists in the plasma within your blood.
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.020]   These are chemicals in your bloodstream
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.040]   that go and mark specific cells that have been infected
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.500]   or viruses with a signal, a chemical signal
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:58.120]   that essentially looks like an eat me signal
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.560]   to these other cell types of your immune system,
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.660]   such that those natural killer cells go through the body
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.840]   and go looking for the cells
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.100]   that have this eat me signal on them
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.660]   and try and destroy those particular cells.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.960]   The other thing that your innate immune system does
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.700]   is that the cells that have been infected
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.000]   and that are undergoing damage,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.300]   remember, they have cold or flu virus within them
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.260]   and they're hijacking the cellular machinery of those cells
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.420]   and using it to produce their own virus, more of the virus.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.160]   And as a consequence, the genetic machinery of those cells
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.840]   is not able to do a bunch of other things
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   that it normally can do, or at least not as well.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.820]   Well, those cells that are really hurting
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.660]   release a help me signal.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.780]   And then in response to that help me signal,
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.020]   your immune system releases what are called cytokines,
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.720]   things like interleukin-1, interleukin-6,
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.520]   tumor necrosis factor alpha,
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.420]   just fancy nerd speak names
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.960]   for different types of molecules
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.480]   that go to the site of infection
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.000]   and try to help or assist to remove that infection.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.040]   And they also try to assist the repair of the cells
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.380]   that have been infected by those viruses.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.220]   Now, one of the mechanical or physical consequences
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.480]   of these chemical signals like interleukin-1,
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.540]   interleukin-6, TNF alpha, again, those are all cytokines,
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.940]   being drawn to a particular cell
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.580]   or region of cells that have been infected
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.100]   is that it creates some physical swelling of the area.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.660]   It impacts the vasculature,
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:24.900]   the veins and capillaries that feed that area.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.780]   And in response to that, they put more blood there
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.840]   so you get some swelling or you'll get, in some cases,
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.740]   the release of histamines, right?
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.380]   We think of antihistamine drugs.
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.620]   Well, histamines are an aspect of your immune system.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.660]   They move around in your body
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.860]   in these really cool cells called mast cells,
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.300]   M-A-S-T, mast cells.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.660]   And when the histamines are released,
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.860]   that area becomes kind of hot and swelling.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.020]   It's what we call edema.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.060]   And that whole area is marked as really a site,
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.700]   just like a crash site on the side of the road.
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.820]   It's like, hey, we've got eat me signals
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.020]   to get the debris and the bad stuff out of here.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.340]   Try to get those viruses out of here.
[00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.940]   We've got help me signals to try and help the injured cells,
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.900]   just like you would try and help people at a car crash.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.380]   And there's a bunch of swelling,
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:03.900]   so there's additional blood flow.
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.580]   Sometimes there's some other physical features as well.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.540]   Now, the important thing to know
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.980]   is that the innate immune system is very fast
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.340]   and it is agnostic to the type of infection.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.440]   In fact, it doesn't even matter if it's a bacterial,
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.860]   physical, fungal, or viral infection,
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.500]   but it certainly isn't paying attention
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.580]   to the exact serotype of cold virus
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.700]   or whether or not it's an H1 influenza
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.260]   or another type of influenza.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.020]   So the way to think about the innate immune system
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.340]   is that it is a very fast and nonspecific response
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.100]   to a viral or other type of invader.
[00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.700]   Now, that's all a bunch of biology,
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.300]   but if you think about it,
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.480]   let's imagine a scenario where you go to a party,
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.600]   hang out at the party,
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.440]   you don't see anyone coughing or sneezing,
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.460]   but maybe one person there has a cold virus
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.900]   or they have a flu virus and they aren't even aware of it.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.980]   They're not going to come down with symptoms
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.980]   for another day or so.
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.760]   You talk to that person, you shake hands,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.100]   maybe touch your eyes, maybe you don't,
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.740]   but you're exposed to that cold or flu virus.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:58.500]   You go home, you go to sleep,
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.160]   you wake up the next morning, you feel fine.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.420]   And then sometime in the next afternoon,
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.260]   you start to feel a little tickle in your throat
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.220]   and you start to feel just a little bit of fatigue
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:07.820]   or malaise.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.720]   Do you have that cold or flu?
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.040]   Well, possibly, okay, we don't know for sure,
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.900]   but assuming that that cold or flu virus
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.140]   did indeed make it into your system,
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.600]   then your innate immune system is starting to create
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.860]   a set of responses that we talked about a moment ago,
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:25.540]   but it also tends to impact things
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.020]   at the level of your brain,
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.660]   such that you kind of feel like,
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.900]   I don't feel quite right.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.300]   I feel like a little bit, I don't feel great.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.260]   And there are a lot of reasons why you would feel that way,
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.380]   and we'll talk about those reasons a little bit later,
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.740]   but does that mean that you're necessarily coming down
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.220]   with a cold or flu?
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.060]   Well, technically, yes.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.700]   Your innate immune system is deployed
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.240]   to fight this foreign viral invader,
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.580]   but whether or not you actually get a full-blown cold or flu
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.700]   or put differently,
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.140]   how severe that cold or flu infection is,
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.000]   it depends on whether or not your innate immune system
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.480]   can fight off that cold or flu at the outset.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.400]   And indeed, there are many cases, we believe,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.280]   where you get exposed to a cold or flu,
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.480]   it makes it into your body,
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.040]   but your innate immune system is sufficient to beat it,
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.460]   to fight it back.
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.660]   This is one of the reasons why it's so important
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.020]   that if you're starting to feel a bit under the weather
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.600]   and you think you're coming down with a cold or flu,
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.940]   that you do certain things in order to make sure
[00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.900]   that your innate immune system is both ready
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.380]   and that it can launch a full-scale attack
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.840]   on that cold or flu virus.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.820]   We're going to talk about how to do that a little bit later.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.860]   I'm not trying to withhold.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:31.540]   It's just, it's important to understand
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.020]   that just because the virus makes it into your body,
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.260]   doesn't necessarily mean
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.340]   that you're going to get a full-blown cold or flu.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.760]   And in fact, that innate immune system sometimes
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.380]   is sufficient to prevent that cold or flu
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.900]   from replicating enough
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.420]   that you get the full-blown set of symptoms.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:47.920]   And that's kind of an ideal scenario.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.220]   So we're definitely going to talk today about what to do
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.440]   if you start to feel a little bit of malaise,
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.880]   what to do if you discover that,
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.320]   oh, you know that person I was hanging out with
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.260]   at the party the night before,
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.660]   they're really sick with a cold or flu.
[00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:01.940]   Because there are things you can do
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:03.100]   to increase the probability
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.360]   that your innate immune system
[00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.300]   can handle the battle sufficiently
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:08.600]   such that you never have to get
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.760]   to the next component of the immune response,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.440]   which is the adaptive immune response.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.540]   I'd like to take a quick break
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.980]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.420]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:22.100]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.740]   to help you better understand your body
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.500]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.260]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.100]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.340]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.180]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.280]   A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.660]   however, is that you get information back
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.540]   about metabolic factors, lipids and hormones and so forth,
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.600]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.800]   With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.720]   because they have a personalized platform
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.280]   that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.780]   metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.660]   but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
[00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.000]   that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.260]   supplements, et cetera,
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.540]   that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.900]   that are optimal for you.
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.300]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.600]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.220]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:17.340]   Okay, so the third layer of your immune system
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.280]   is your adaptive immune system,
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.460]   and this is an amazing aspect of you, okay?
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.980]   The stuff we talked about up until now,
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:28.700]   the physical barrier, the innate immune system, so, so cool,
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:32.800]   but the adaptive immune system is really a mindblower.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.100]   The most important thing to understand
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.940]   about your adaptive immune system
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.340]   is that as the name suggests,
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.740]   its job is to create antibodies specific
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.840]   to the very intruder that made it into you
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.900]   and infected your cells,
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.740]   the very specific serotype of cold virus,
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:52.740]   the very specific type of influenza,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.540]   such that you defeat that virus,
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.920]   but then in an amazing way,
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.180]   your adaptive immune system also maintains a memory
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.460]   of that battle and keeps within your body,
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:07.300]   believe it or not, within a population of stem cells,
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.320]   which are cells that can rise to more cells,
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.900]   such that if you ever encounter
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.420]   that same serotype of cold virus
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.660]   or same strain of influenza again,
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.300]   that your antibodies can immediately
[00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.500]   neutralize that colder flu virus.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.780]   The adaptive immune system has the ability to make proteins
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:29.300]   that have a particular shape on their surface
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.300]   that matches the shape of the thing
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.340]   that your immune system is trying to kill.
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:39.620]   Now, the adaptive immune system has two basic phases.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.780]   In the first phase, the adaptive immune system
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:45.480]   makes these things called immunoglobulins, IGs,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.220]   and the immunoglobulins come in different forms.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.340]   There's IgG, there's IgM,
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.180]   there are other types of IGs as well.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.440]   For sake of today's discussion,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.540]   know that the initial wave of antibodies
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:01.280]   that the adaptive immune system makes are of the IgM variety
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.940]   and the IgM antibodies can travel to
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.700]   and latch onto the surface of the colder flu virus
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.900]   and it matches it pretty well.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.140]   It's not perfect, but it matches it pretty well.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.800]   Think about, for instance,
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.280]   a particular serotype of cold virus or the H1N1 flu virus
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.480]   having a very particular contour on its surface.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.240]   The IgM approximates that contour
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.920]   such that it's better at fighting that cold or flu virus
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.020]   than is the innate immune system,
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.100]   but it's not a perfect fit.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.680]   However, the adaptive immune system
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.440]   doesn't stop with the production of those IgMs.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.980]   The adaptive immune system takes that information
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:42.240]   about how precise or imprecise that fit is
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:43.800]   between the IgM antibody
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.160]   and the surface of that particular cold or flu virus,
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:49.400]   and then, in an amazing way,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.940]   sends signals back to the stem cell populations
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.720]   in the bone marrow and other tissues,
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   and then more antibodies come out of the IgG variety,
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:01.600]   and the IgG proteins are very specific
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.180]   to the shape of that particular cold virus or flu virus,
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:10.920]   such that the IgGs then can define to
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.080]   and neutralize those viral particles, okay?
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.480]   So when we talk about the immune system,
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.000]   we're talking about a physical barrier
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.900]   that, if it is breached, a cold or flu virus
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.840]   takes residence and starts to replicate.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.880]   The innate immune system launches a generalized attack
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.400]   on that cold or flu virus,
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.920]   and then the adaptive immune system kicks in
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:32.960]   usually a couple days later,
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.580]   first with the production of antibodies
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.980]   that are pretty specific to the particular virus
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.840]   that happened to make it into the body and infect cells,
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.980]   but then there's a second wave of production of antibodies,
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.360]   and those antibodies are incredibly specific
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.080]   for that particular cold or flu virus,
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.880]   and, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.120]   the adaptive immune system then acquires a memory
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:59.260]   of the specific fit between a given antibody that it made
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.080]   and the viral invader and the successful battle
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.560]   that those antibodies waged on that viral invader,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.440]   and that memory is maintained such that,
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.300]   if the next week or the next season,
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.800]   you encounter the exact same serotype of cold virus
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.360]   or same type of flu virus,
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.620]   well, then you already have antibodies ready to be deployed.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.480]   Sometimes the antibodies continue
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.220]   to circulate in your system.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:24.320]   Sometimes you need to generate more of them,
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.220]   and the immune system is that amazing.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.120]   It can actually send a message
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.620]   back to that stem cell population
[00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:31.080]   in the bone marrow or elsewhere,
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.480]   say, "Hey, listen, this virus that we beat
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.320]   a few weeks or months or years back, it's back.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.640]   We need more antibodies," and boom,
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.320]   your adaptive immune system churns those antibodies out
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.360]   and kills the virus.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.320]   Now, as a final point about the immune system,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.680]   I've been talking a lot today about cells traveling to
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.640]   and killing viruses and sending signals,
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:50.860]   "Eat me, help me," et cetera.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.200]   It's important to understand that,
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.160]   while cells can migrate through the body,
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.660]   a lot of what we're talking about here
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.880]   is the movement of proteins through the vascular,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:01.060]   through the blood system of the body,
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.840]   but there's another system that's very important
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.320]   for all of this that's collaborating
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.080]   with the vascular system, and that's the lymphatic system,
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:09.000]   and we don't have time to go into a whole lecture
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.580]   about the lymphatic system, but suffice to say,
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.840]   the lymphatic system can pull stuff from the blood,
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   such as viruses, but also cells that have been beaten up
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.000]   or cells that have been eaten and are contained
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.880]   within other cells, such as macrophages,
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.080]   and it can do some filtering of those different cell types,
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.840]   and it can produce its own useful chemicals
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.160]   that then can be reintroduced to the bloodstream
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.440]   in order to help combat the infection.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.940]   Now, this becomes very important when later we talk about
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:41.160]   how specific forms, intensities, and durations
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.280]   of exercise can increase the ability
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:47.680]   for your innate immune system to combat infections
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.540]   so that your adaptive immune system perhaps
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.280]   doesn't even have to get involved in the battle
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.340]   because your innate system handled it.
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:54.840]   There are data to show the exercise
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.920]   of sufficient intensity and duration,
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.240]   but not excessive intensity and duration,
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.000]   can recruit the lymphatic system and recruit
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.860]   or increase the activity of the innate immune system
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.840]   even in the absence of an infection,
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.560]   such that if you go to that party
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.840]   and you encounter that person with a cold or flu,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.680]   you can defeat that cold or flu virus at the outset
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.460]   and never have to deal with making antibodies
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.280]   to that cold or flu virus at all.
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.080]   Okay, so now you have a fairly sophisticated
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.720]   biological understanding of what colds are,
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.000]   what flus are, and the way that your immune system works
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.720]   to fight off viruses like colds and flus.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.420]   So with that in mind, I think now is the appropriate time
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.800]   to start talking about what the scientific
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.120]   peer-reviewed research says about how to allow
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.620]   your immune system to function at its best
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.940]   such that you can combat colds and flus.
[01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.440]   Meaning, if you are exposed to a cold or flu,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.040]   that is if it breaches that physical barrier of your skin
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.600]   and the mucosal lining of your nose, your mouth,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.960]   or it gets into your eyes,
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.440]   that you stand the greatest chance of defeating
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.520]   that cold or flu at the level of your innate immune system,
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.200]   such that your adaptive immune system
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.680]   never even has to respond to it
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.960]   by creating all those specific antibodies.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.880]   Now, fortunately, there are a lot of different things
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.640]   we can do to improve the function of our immune system.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.040]   In fact, I feel like any time the winter months roll around,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.700]   we start to see the same list of things surface
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.080]   online and in the press.
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.640]   And I don't want to diminish these things.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.120]   They are in fact the bedrock of maintaining
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.140]   and enhancing the function of your innate immune system.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:21.280]   So what are those?
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.260]   Well, some of these will be pretty obvious,
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:26.800]   things like getting enough quality sleep each night.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.560]   We know, for instance, that if you're sleep deprived,
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.640]   so especially if you stay up all night,
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   but certainly even if you only get 50% or 75%
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.920]   of your sleep requirement,
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.960]   that your innate immune system is going to suffer.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.700]   It's not going to be as effective
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.480]   at combating flus or colds.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.820]   In addition to that, we know that exercise of specific type
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.760]   and specific duration and specific intensity
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.120]   can serve to bolster the innate immune system.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.400]   And we'll talk about the specific exercise protocols
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.280]   that can best achieve that.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.120]   We also hear, and it's absolutely true,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.280]   that we need adequate nutrition.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:04.600]   If we are in a caloric deficit, for instance,
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.240]   if we're trying to diet through the winter months,
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.180]   which many people try to do,
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.240]   that can place our innate immune system
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.880]   in a bit of a compromised state.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.140]   That said, things like intermittent fasting
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.820]   or even longer duration fasts have been implicated,
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.960]   and here I really want to underscore implicated,
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.240]   in brief improvements in the function
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.780]   of the innate immune system.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.620]   However, extended fasts or not eating enough calories
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:31.560]   to maintain body weight for many, many days in a row
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.760]   can actually compromise the function
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.140]   of the innate immune system.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.500]   I'll go into this a bit deeper in a moment.
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.300]   And then of course, we hear about stress,
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.340]   that we're all supposed to regulate our levels of stress,
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:42.780]   not get too stressed.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.860]   And here I have to put an asterisk next to those statements
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.500]   because yes, indeed, chronic stress,
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.380]   meaning stress that continues day after day after day,
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.820]   or even short periods of stress
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.500]   that impede our ability to sleep at night,
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.020]   can indeed reduce the functioning of our innate immune system.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.860]   However, it's also clear that short bouts of stress,
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.380]   provided that they don't inhibit our ability
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.480]   to sleep that night,
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.220]   can actually enhance the function of the immune system.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.740]   And this is something that I don't think
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.200]   is talked about enough.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.080]   You know, we hear so often that quote unquote,
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.260]   "Cortisol is bad, it's a stress hormone."
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.760]   Listen, cortisol is fantastic,
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.900]   provided that it is elevated early in the day
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.520]   and not late in the day or evening.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.060]   Also, cortisol does have thresholds
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.720]   beyond which if it's too high, can be bad for us.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.940]   But it's also the case that if cortisol levels are too low,
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:35.340]   that's bad for us,
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.520]   and it's especially bad
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.000]   for the functioning of our immune system
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.340]   because glucocorticoids, of which cortisol is,
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.580]   have an important role in activating
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:46.300]   those natural killer cells of the innate immune system.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.140]   They are one of the primary signals
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.480]   by which those interleukins,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.700]   like interleukin-1 and interleukin-6,
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.320]   are deployed in our body.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.820]   And so very often we'll hear stress increases inflammation,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:59.560]   and indeed interleukin-1 and interleukin-6
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.940]   are pro-inflammatory.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.300]   You might think, "Oh my goodness, I don't want that.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.120]   I don't want cortisol.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.920]   I don't want these interleukins elevated."
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.760]   But guess what?
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.360]   The inflammation response is also an important component
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   of that innate immune system
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:13.560]   that allows us to combat infections.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.360]   So in trying to keep our innate immune system tuned up,
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.540]   I realize that's not a biological statement, tuned up,
[01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.540]   but keep our immune system functioning at its best,
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.700]   we want inflammation available as a tool
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.700]   to combat infection.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.200]   We want cortisol available as a way
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.660]   to activate that inflammation
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.340]   and other aspects of our immune system.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:34.660]   We just don't want so much cortisol
[01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.500]   and so much inflammation that we can't sleep
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.460]   and that our gut microbiome suffers.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.220]   And that brings me to the other component
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.480]   that's important for the basic functioning
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:44.540]   of your innate immune system
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.000]   so that you can be at your strongest
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.300]   when you inevitably encounter those cold and flu viruses.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.620]   Why do I say inevitably?
[01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:53.460]   Look, if you exist in the world,
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.060]   that is, if you live on planet earth,
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.740]   you are going to be bombarded with different viruses
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:04:59.540]   and bacteria and funguses
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:00.980]   and all this stuff throughout your days.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.380]   And yes, in those winter months,
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.300]   because people are spending more time indoors
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.980]   and they're touching each other and surfaces more,
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.100]   breathing on each other more,
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.300]   sneezing on each other more, and so on and so forth,
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.180]   there is more propagation of colds and flus.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.780]   So if we take a step back and we ask,
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:17.300]   "How can I have my immune system as strong
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.360]   and ready as possible to combat cold and flu viruses?"
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.500]   We get to those basics.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.340]   It's make sure you're getting enough quality sleep
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.540]   each night.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.420]   How much is enough?
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.020]   However much you need in order to not feel sleepy
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.980]   during the day, except maybe the requirement
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.600]   for a short nap of anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes.
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.620]   Not everyone requires that, but that's perfectly normal
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.500]   to have an afternoon dip in energy
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.660]   that can be restored with a short nap
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:43.820]   or non-sleep deep rest.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.020]   We'll provide links to non-sleep deep rest
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.940]   and other tools in the show note captions
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.120]   that are zero cost tools to allow you to recover your energy.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.500]   Some people just simply take a nap and that sort of thing.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.560]   If you want tools for improving your sleep
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.480]   and making sure that you're getting enough quality sleep
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.520]   each night, we will also provide a link
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.320]   to our zero cost sleep toolkit
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.140]   that details that in PDF form.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.400]   It just lists out the things that you can do or take
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.640]   if that's your choice and so on and so forth.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:11.240]   And of course we've done episodes on quality nutrition
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.060]   and what that means.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.320]   We've done episodes on stress and how to combat stress,
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.860]   and we've done episodes on the so-called gut microbiome.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.900]   But right now, I just want to mention
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.200]   that the gut microbiome,
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.660]   which are the trillions of little micro bacteria
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.400]   that interact heavily with the immune system
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.520]   and help support the immune system,
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.440]   you want to keep the gut microbiome healthy.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.140]   So you'll notice that we include some tools
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.540]   related to the gut microbiome here in a moment.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.540]   And this is very important.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.460]   Keep in mind that the microbiome
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.500]   doesn't just exist in the gut.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.860]   So often these days we hear about the gut microbiome
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.900]   and I'm oh so happy that the gut microbiome
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.360]   is getting the attention that it deserves
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.500]   in the context of mental health,
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.940]   physical health and performance.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:53.040]   But we can't forget that the microbiome also exists
[01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:56.740]   on the surface of the eyes and in the nasal passages.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.220]   And indeed the microbiome that's specific
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.700]   to the nasal passages, as I mentioned before,
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.400]   is very different from the microbiome
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.100]   that exists within the mouth.
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.300]   And the microbiome that exists within the mucosa
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.620]   of the nasal passages seems to be the most effective
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.300]   at combating any viruses that we encounter,
[01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.340]   especially cold and flu viruses.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.300]   So while ideally you would never encounter
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.060]   a cold or flu virus, we know that if the cold or flu viruses
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.960]   go in through the nasal passages,
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.300]   you stand the greatest chance of combating
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.500]   that particular cold or flu.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.420]   So what does that mean?
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:31.100]   This is where I get to make a strong push
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.860]   for being a nasal breather.
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.780]   Certainly in sleep, you want to be a nasal breather,
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:39.100]   but also throughout the day, unless you're speaking
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.700]   or unless you're exercising hard enough
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.700]   that you need to breathe through your mouth
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.140]   or unless you're eating, being a nasal breather
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.000]   is known to provide the right milieu, the right environment
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.800]   to keep that nasal microbiome at its healthiest
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.980]   and to promote the diversity of microbiota
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.340]   in the nasal passages that can best protect you
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.740]   against colds and flus.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:00.920]   And there are a growing number of studies
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.440]   that point to this fact.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.340]   I'll provide a link to one that I like very much,
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:07.100]   which is entitled "Alterations in Oral Nasal Pharyngeal
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.840]   "Microbiota and Salivary Proteins
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.020]   "in Mouth-Breathing Children."
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.780]   This is but one study pointing to the fact
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.620]   that being a nasal breather is a good thing.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.180]   Mouth-breathing children and mouth-breathing adults,
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:22.620]   meaning children and adults that default to mouth-breathing
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.140]   tend to get more infections of the upper respiratory tract,
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:27.560]   including colds and flus.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.340]   Consciously focusing on nasal breathing
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:31.640]   is one of the best things that we can all do
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.580]   to combat any colds or flus that we might encounter.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.820]   So earlier we talked about trying to avoid
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.000]   touching your eyes, at least without washing your hands first
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.040]   or sanitizing your hands first after you meet somebody,
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.540]   keeping in mind that most people do that unconsciously.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:50.300]   Here we are also saying when you enter a room,
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.860]   you're hanging out with people,
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:53.500]   maybe you're waiting for public transportation
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.940]   or you're at work or walking down the hallway,
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.940]   unless you are exercising hard, unless you are talking,
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:03.000]   try to focus on being a nasal breather.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.120]   There are a bunch of other reasons
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.600]   to be a nasal breather as well,
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.040]   but this is one of the primary ones.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.180]   And I'll provide a link to another reference,
[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.020]   which is the book "Jaws" by my colleagues at Stanford,
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.820]   which talks about nasal breathing
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:15.420]   and the importance of nasal breathing,
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.940]   but also the degree to which children and adults
[01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:23.500]   open themselves up to increased levels of viral infections,
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.780]   as well as bacterial infections,
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:26.680]   but viral infections in particular,
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.900]   when they rely on mouth-breathing
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.700]   and the incredible benefits of doing this very simple,
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:36.680]   zero cost thing of whenever you can consciously remember to
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.300]   breathing through your nose,
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.940]   as opposed to breathing through your mouth.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.940]   And just as an additional point about nasal breathing,
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.140]   because I can't resist telling you this,
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.340]   I just think it's so cool, such an interesting adaptation.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.340]   When we breathe through our nose,
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:53.420]   we heat the air in a way that's very different
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.880]   from the way we heat the air when we mouth breathe.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.780]   And by heating the air that's coming into the nasal passages,
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.460]   it shifts the probability that cold or flu viruses
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.540]   will successfully embed in the mucosal lining
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.240]   and infect the underlying cells
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.980]   and get into the other cells and tissues of our body.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.960]   So this whole thing about nasal breathing
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.240]   is important and effective at the level
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.840]   of temperature regulation of the milieu within the nose,
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.960]   and therefore the viruses that end up in the nose,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.240]   as well as the mucosal lining,
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.120]   the chemicals made by the mucosal lining.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.840]   And again, the nose is a very different place
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.680]   than the mouth.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.420]   In fact, I'll provide a link to yet another paper,
[01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.180]   which is entitled Human Nasal Microbiota.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.360]   It's a really interesting paper.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.940]   It's actually an interview with a scientist
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.320]   who's expert in the nasal microbiome,
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.540]   talking about how this structure within our nose
[01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.120]   really is the primary defense site
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.360]   by which we destroy potentially incoming viruses.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360]   So if it sounds overly simple,
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.020]   just breathe through your nose.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:57.380]   It is very simple, but it's also very effective.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.760]   Now it's also clearly the case
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.360]   that keeping your gut microbiome is advantageous
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.440]   for keeping your innate immune system
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.220]   at its most robust level of functioning.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.540]   And I should mention that your gut microbiome
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.440]   isn't just about your stomach.
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.460]   You know, we hear the word gut and we think stomach,
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:16.640]   but it's actually the entire length of your digestive tract
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.180]   from your mouth out the other end.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:22.160]   And different microbiota exist at different locations
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.700]   along that tract of mucosa.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.500]   And there are a couple of things that one can do
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.580]   in order to make sure that the gut microbiome
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.380]   is best supported along that entire length.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.960]   The first one is that,
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.280]   and this was covered on the episode
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.780]   that we did with my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg,
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.240]   who is a world expert in the gut microbiome.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.960]   And that is to consume anywhere from two to four servings
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.520]   of low sugar fermented foods per day.
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.480]   So things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi,
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.600]   things like kefir, things like kombucha.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.680]   It can be a little bit of work
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.200]   to figure out which of these you like
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.160]   and which ones you're willing to consume on a regular basis.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.920]   But it's very clear that the brine,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.780]   you know, that kind of a salty solution
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.260]   around the sauerkraut, and by the way,
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.240]   when I say sauerkraut, what we're talking about here
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.980]   is the type that has to be refrigerated.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:11.880]   It contains what are called live cultures
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.660]   as opposed to the sauerkraut that can exist
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.220]   in the non-refrigerated portion of the store.
[01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:19.340]   Or pickles that also have that brine
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.220]   and that have to be kept in the refrigerator
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.940]   even before they're opened.
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:24.500]   And of course, things like yogurt,
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:27.560]   which have active live cultures.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.840]   Those are the sorts of things that are going to best support
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.420]   the diversity of microbiota
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.920]   along the entire length of the gut microbiome,
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.440]   such that your gut microbiome can do its job
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.300]   in supporting your nervous system.
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.640]   But here, especially in the context of today's discussion,
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.840]   your immune system.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.040]   Now, the low sugar component
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.000]   of low sugar fermented foods is important
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.060]   because what we know is that if you're consuming yogurts
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.240]   with a lot of sugar, or you're consuming kombucha
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.140]   with high levels of sugar, or you're consuming pickles
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.740]   or sauerkraut that have a lot of sugar in them,
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:02.840]   you're probably going to start to create some other issues
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.720]   related to the sugar.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.560]   What you're really looking for
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.340]   are these low sugar fermented foods.
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.540]   And they can be a little bit tricky to seek out in the store,
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:10.140]   but they're usually there.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.660]   And once you identify the ones that you like,
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:13.560]   you should really aim to get two to four servings
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.780]   of those per day.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.980]   You can also consume a prebiotic or probiotic
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:18.660]   in the form of capsule form.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.380]   Things like AG1 athletic greens
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.380]   also contain prebiotic, probiotic,
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:27.560]   but it's very clear that consuming two to four servings
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.420]   of low sugar fermented foods per day
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.640]   is among the best ways to promote health
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.740]   of the gut microbiome.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.660]   And that the gut microbiome is so, so important
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:38.560]   for keeping the innate immune system thriving,
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.440]   such that it can combat the colds or flus
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.380]   that are trying to bombard your system.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:43.900]   Now there's another tool that you can use
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.620]   to enhance your gut microbiome.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.460]   I have to warn you,
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:49.420]   this one might make a few of you cringe a little bit,
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.020]   but this is one that I actually started doing
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.960]   about four months ago.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.100]   It's an interesting one.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.700]   It kind of dates back to some older quote unquote
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.280]   traditional medicine practices,
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.940]   but it makes really good logical sense.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:01.780]   To be fair,
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.700]   I'm not aware of any randomized control trial
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.160]   exploring the use of this protocol,
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.460]   but it's so simple and completely cost-free
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.900]   and it stands so strongly on the logic
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.160]   of how the gut and oral microbiome work
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.680]   that frankly I started doing it
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.780]   and whether or not it's placebo effect or not, I don't know,
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:20.160]   but I feel better and it's so easy to do
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.620]   and it stands to potentially improve the function
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:25.860]   of your gut microbiome enough
[01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.540]   that I figured I would at least share it with you
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.860]   and then you can decide.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.820]   So what this protocol essentially consists of
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.520]   is before you go to sleep at night or in the morning,
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.580]   you pour yourself a little bit of water,
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:37.920]   whatever water you happen to consume,
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.780]   just clean, clear water.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.380]   And then you take a sip of that water
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.780]   when you wake up in the morning
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.620]   and you swish it around in your mouth
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.540]   and then you swallow it.
[01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.180]   Now for those of you that are like, oh, gross,
[01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.120]   let's think about this.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.740]   Is it really gross
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.940]   to swish a little bit of water around in your mouth
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:57.300]   and then swallow that water when you first wake up
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.300]   prior to brushing your teeth, of course?
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.500]   Well, it might seem gross to you,
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.660]   but throughout the night when you're sleeping,
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.440]   especially if you are a nasal breather while you sleep,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.840]   the environment within your mouth
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.180]   is such that you're breeding a lot of bacteria.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:16.340]   You are creating all those little microbacteria
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:20.740]   that potentially can inhabit your digestive tract
[01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:23.100]   and provide at least some of the substrate
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.460]   for the microbiota in your digestive tract to thrive.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.980]   And if that seems gross to you, keep in mind,
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.380]   that's what having a healthy gut microbiome
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.980]   really is all about.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.320]   So the protocol is very simple at zero cost.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.600]   You take a swig of water, swish around and swallow it.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.220]   Oddly, it doesn't taste bad.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.140]   In fact, it'll just taste like swallowing.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.020]   And in fact, it tastes like swallowing
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:46.840]   a little bit of water.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.020]   It's not as if it tastes like bad breath
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.180]   or something like that.
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.620]   It's a very simple protocol that, again,
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:55.020]   no randomized control trials,
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.940]   but really stands on the logic of how the oral microbiome
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.540]   and the gut microbiome interact.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.940]   And because what we're talking about here
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:04.260]   is supporting the function of your gut microbiome
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.700]   such that it supports the function
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.740]   of your innate immune system,
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.780]   such that you can avoid colds and flus.
[01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:12.420]   At least to me, it seems like a pretty low bar, yes.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.600]   Okay, so to bolster your innate immune system,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.220]   you want to get that quality sleep
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.940]   as often as you possibly can.
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:19.620]   You want to support the gut microbiome
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.420]   in the ways that we just described.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.500]   What about exercise?
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:23.680]   We hear it all the time.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.160]   Exercise is so good for us.
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.140]   It enhances the immune system and on and on.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.780]   And listen, I'm a huge believer in exercise.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.100]   I personally like to do three bouts
[01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:35.420]   of cardiovascular exercise per week,
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.140]   one long, one medium, one short.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.460]   And I do three bouts of resistance training each week.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:42.500]   All of that, and specifically what I do
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.900]   is available to you as a zero cross protocol
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.220]   in the form of a PDF.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:47.980]   We have a link to that in the show note captions.
[01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.580]   I also have a whole episode about foundational fitness
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.020]   and so on and so on.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.620]   The discussion we're going to have now
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.660]   is about what general forms of exercise
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.280]   actually do support the innate immune system.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.420]   And, and this is really important,
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:04.080]   what forms of exercise actually deplete
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.300]   your innate immune system?
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.900]   This isn't talked about enough, I think.
[01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:11.060]   There are certain intensities and durations of exercise
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.300]   that make us more vulnerable to colds and flus.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.580]   So we're going to discuss that.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.560]   Before we do that, I want to just briefly touch
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.540]   into something that I hear a lot,
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.000]   which is the question,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.720]   if I'm feeling a little bit rundown,
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:24.580]   should I exercise or not?
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.580]   And to be honest, there isn't a straightforward answer
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.660]   to that question.
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.600]   It's impossible for me or for you to know
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.140]   whether or not you were indeed exposed to a cold or flu
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.400]   and you're starting to combat it
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.780]   at the level of your innate immune system,
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.260]   or whether or not you're just feeling a little bit sluggish.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:44.440]   However, what we do know is that if you are feeling malaise
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.740]   at the level of the body,
[01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:47.660]   like your body is feeling different,
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.940]   it's feeling heavier, you're feeling tired,
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.160]   you're feeling tired at a time of day
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.600]   that doesn't make sense,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   given your usual patterns of being tired.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.960]   You're feeling tired in a way that doesn't make sense,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:00.100]   given how much sleep you got the night before, right?
[01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:01.080]   I mean, here, what we're talking about
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.560]   is ruling out any possible life stress,
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.700]   or you were up too late,
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:06.360]   or you drank caffeine at the wrong time,
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.620]   or something like that.
[01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.100]   What we know is that if you're feeling that general malaise
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.080]   across your whole body,
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.200]   it is fairly likely that you're coming down with something
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.880]   and that your best response to that would be to go home,
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.040]   take a hot shower or bath,
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.820]   I'll explain why you would want to do that in a few minutes,
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.260]   and then get into bed early,
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.600]   and even if you can't fall asleep,
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.760]   to just be as still and as relaxed as possible.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.020]   We know that if you push into bouts of intense activity,
[01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.460]   or even just push yourself to engage in activity
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.040]   when you're feeling run down at that sort of
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.800]   whole body level, maybe a little tickle in your throat,
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.160]   you are going to compromise
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.920]   the function of your innate immune system.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.960]   And it's very likely that you're going to get
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.080]   more sick than you would otherwise.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.060]   So here's my suggestion.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.360]   If you're starting to feel run down
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.720]   at the level of whole body malaise,
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.640]   or you just don't feel right,
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:56.360]   you're best off taking a hot shower or bath
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.200]   and getting into bed,
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.080]   or just getting into bed and trying to rest
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:18:59.960]   and get as much sleep,
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.040]   probably even a little bit of extra sleep.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.600]   And here's why.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.760]   That whole body malaise,
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.520]   that extra fatigue that's not easily explained
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.220]   by other factors in your life,
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.480]   have to do with the fact that
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.880]   when your innate immune system is activated,
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.700]   meaning it's already combating a cold or flu,
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:19.760]   interleukin-1 and interleukin-6
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.500]   have a way of interacting with a particular brain area
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.180]   called the dorsal raphae nucleus,
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.880]   which is chock-a-block full of neurons
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.120]   that release serotonin.
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.600]   And serotonin from the dorsal raphae nucleus
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.280]   acts on specific regions of your hypothalamus,
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.080]   areas like the preoptic region,
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.180]   for those of you that want to know,
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.160]   and other areas of the hypothalamus
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.760]   that generate a state of sleepiness.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.500]   In addition, when we are getting sick,
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.040]   our sleep patterns change.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.520]   We feel like we need to sleep more,
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.720]   but we don't feel as rested from that sleep.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.960]   And that has to do with the ways
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.860]   that serotonin interacts with some of the components
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.700]   of the brain circuitry involved in sleep
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.840]   that controls slow wave or deep sleep.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.560]   And this is a whole discussion unto itself.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.640]   I actually covered a lot of the mechanistic aspects
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.040]   of this business of immune-induced sleepiness
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.400]   and malaise associated with feeling sick
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   in an episode about interactions
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.880]   between the neural and immune system
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.600]   that I will also provide a link to
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.700]   in the show note captions.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.540]   But suffice to say,
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.920]   if you're feeling that whole body malaise,
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.760]   and especially if you also
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.800]   have a little bit of a throat tickle,
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.000]   you're just not feeling right for you,
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.560]   you're not accustomed to feeling that way
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.160]   at that time of day or night,
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.940]   well, then I encourage you to get rest
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.120]   because chances are you're already combating an infection.
[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.560]   However, if you are out and about a lot
[01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.480]   during the winter months,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.700]   or you're interacting with a lot of people
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.560]   by virtue of work or public transportation or whatever,
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:38.900]   the gym, et cetera, or you're a school teacher,
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.600]   maybe your kids are coming home with colds and flus,
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.280]   and you're not yet feeling that malaise,
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.100]   you're not feeling any throat tickle,
[01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.860]   you're not getting that kind of burning
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.240]   or tickle within your nasal passages when you breathe.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.260]   We're all familiar with these things,
[01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:53.200]   the watering of the eyes
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.100]   that kind of precedes getting the full-blown cold or flu.
[01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.200]   Well, if you're not experiencing that stuff
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.700]   and you want to keep your innate immune system strong
[01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.700]   and able to combat off colds and flus,
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.300]   then we know that exercise can be an excellent way
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:11.420]   to increase the output of that innate immune system.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:13.640]   What I mean by that is the appropriate intensity
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.940]   and duration of exercise can act as a stressor
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.420]   that promotes a bit of inflammation,
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:21.640]   yes, the release of cytokines,
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.660]   and a bit of activation of the innate immune system,
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.600]   including the production of more white blood cells,
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.860]   natural killer cells,
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:31.060]   such that you're sort of prompting the innate immune system
[01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:33.220]   to almost think that there's something to battle
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.020]   such that if you ever encounter an infection,
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.780]   you can defeat it right off the bat.
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.140]   So we're going to get granular here
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:42.400]   about what we mean by proper intensity
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.680]   and duration of exercise.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.540]   There's a wonderful review that was published in 2019
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.820]   in the Journal of Sport and Health Science
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.380]   entitled "The Compelling Link Between Physical Activity
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.820]   and the Body's Defense System."
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.560]   And there's a lot to this review article,
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.820]   but I'll just highlight a few of the critical features
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.840]   that are going to directly relate to protocols
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.880]   that I think all of you are going to be interested in.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.340]   First of all, we know that exercise
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:09.220]   that's of 60 minutes in duration or less,
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.060]   and that is intense, but not all out effort, okay?
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:14.300]   Here, we're not talking about
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.500]   percentage of single repetition max weight.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:22.040]   Here, we're not talking about 70 to 85% of one's VO2 max.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.460]   What we're talking about is you subjectively gauging
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.460]   what is a 10 out of 10 effort?
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.980]   Like you could not do any more.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.300]   You could not contribute any more effort
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.740]   to that exercise bout.
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.660]   And that's true whether or not
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.180]   we're talking about resistance training exercise
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.740]   or cardiovascular exercise like running or rowing
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:39.080]   or things of that sort.
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.580]   What we know is that if you do that sort of exercise
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.840]   for about 60 minutes or less,
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.080]   you promote the exchange of components
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.700]   between the blood and the lymphatic system
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:54.620]   that increase the circulation of those cells and chemicals
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:56.000]   within the innate immune system,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.220]   such that not just during exercise,
[01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.960]   but for many, many hours afterwards,
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.740]   maybe even as much as 24 hours afterwards,
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.940]   your innate immune system level of baseline activity
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.600]   is ramped up, allowing you to better combat infections
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.540]   such as colds and flus.
[01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:14.840]   Okay, so this is an incentive for getting regular exercise
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:17.040]   of 60 minutes or less per day,
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:21.000]   making it of sufficient intensity
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.040]   for your innate immune system
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.000]   to deploy more of those chemicals
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.800]   and for your lymphatic and blood circulation
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.000]   to increase their exchange of materials
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.680]   enough that your innate immune system is bolstered.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.560]   However, it is absolutely not the case
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.880]   that more is better.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.400]   In fact, it's probably the case that less is better.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:41.440]   Here's what we know for sure.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.680]   And this review covers sort of the extreme
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:44.520]   of these examples.
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:49.060]   But for instance, people that do bouts of walking each day
[01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.540]   for about 60 minutes, brisk walking,
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.460]   experience increased T cell function.
[01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.100]   So that's an immune cell that goes out
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.460]   and combats cold and flu viruses
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.160]   and natural killer cell activity.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.540]   So those increase.
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.840]   Increased macrophage function.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.160]   You are now familiar with these cells.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.520]   If you don't know exactly what they do,
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.880]   just keep in mind that you heard about these
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.600]   in the context of what the innate immune system does
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.140]   to go out and fight colds and flus.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:17.320]   Cytokines increase, but not dramatically, okay?
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.300]   So this is a mild inflammation response.
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.040]   Stress hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine,
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.120]   norepinephrine, also called adrenaline and noradrenaline.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.160]   Those are deployed as well.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.600]   So 60 minutes or less of this moderate
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.580]   to high intensity exercise
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:34.120]   creates this mild stress response
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.560]   and an increase in the function of the innate immune system.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.120]   However, people that run a marathon,
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.120]   and as I recall, a marathon is 26.2 miles,
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.440]   if I'm not mistaken,
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:50.120]   they experience a very different pattern of immune response
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:52.440]   to that long bout of exercise.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.200]   So here we're comparing one hour of exercise to three hours.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.560]   Is that what it takes to run a marathon?
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.720]   I have some friends that are marathoners.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.360]   I'm guessing about three, maybe four hours
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.640]   if you're really slow,
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.440]   but somewhere between, I don't know,
[01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.760]   two and a half and three hours
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.760]   if you're trained up and you're doing it
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.080]   and you're doing them regularly.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.120]   Well, here's the point.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.200]   People who just ran a marathon
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.160]   and people who have been training for a marathon
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.720]   and are approaching that marathon
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.500]   are severely immune compromised.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:21.300]   The levels of their T cell function
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.360]   are way below baseline,
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:24.480]   meaning their innate immune system
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.540]   is not functioning nearly as well as it would
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:28.560]   if they were to not exercise at all.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.920]   Their natural killer cell activity
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.360]   is also greatly diminished.
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.080]   These are huge, huge reductions in these cells
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.920]   that is in the function of the innate immune system
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.440]   and their stress hormones
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.240]   and their inflammatory molecules
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.100]   such as cytokines circulating in their blood
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.140]   are extremely high.
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.640]   Now again, we're representing opposite ends of the spectrum
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.140]   here with one hour or less of exercise daily
[01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:53.840]   versus 26.2 mile marathon exercise
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.640]   or half marathons as the case may be.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.940]   And let me be very direct.
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:59.200]   I'm not discouraging people from running
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.120]   or training for marathons or half marathons.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:01.960]   I think that's great.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.680]   Just understand what you're doing to your immune system
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.040]   when you do that and take the necessary precautions.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.080]   But I think most people listening to this
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.140]   are trying to think about ways
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.200]   that they can avoid getting colds and flus.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.800]   And certainly running marathons
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.520]   is not going to be the way to do that.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.360]   Quite the contrary.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.560]   The way to do that is in addition to the other things
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:20.080]   we've been talking about to get regular exercise,
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.640]   maybe not every single day.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.720]   I'm actually a fan of taking one day per week
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.760]   completely off from exercise.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.700]   Usually on that day, I'll do some sauna and cold
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.120]   if I have it available to me.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.700]   But the point is this,
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.600]   you don't have to exercise for an hour a day
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.080]   in order to get this improvement
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.920]   in the innate immune response.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.360]   Data show that you can get this improvement
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.100]   in innate immune response
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.700]   with as little as 20 minutes per day
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.280]   and probably even as little as 12 minutes per day.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.820]   However, if you're going to try and accomplish this increase
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.040]   in the innate immune system function or output
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:55.800]   with a shorter bout of exercise, such as 12 minutes,
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.440]   it better be 12 minutes of very high intensity training.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.020]   In fact, that's what lands on my, for me, it's Friday,
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:02.640]   but it doesn't really matter which day of the week.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.040]   There's one day of the week where I do a very short bout
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.880]   of cardiovascular exercise, but I'm sprinting hard
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.780]   for anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.160]   And then I'm taking a brief period of rest
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.060]   and then repeating that for a total of 12 minutes.
[01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.040]   Now, some people hear,
[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.200]   oh, only 12 minutes of exercise required.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.840]   And they default to 12 minutes every single time they train.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.880]   I don't think that's a good idea.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:24.520]   I think that we can take the law of averages here
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.000]   and say the following.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.700]   I do believe everyone should do a combination
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.580]   of cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:33.560]   Perhaps, I think in general, not on the same days,
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.400]   but if you're going to do that
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.240]   and you want to maintain healthy immune system function,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.620]   my suggestion, what I do is unless it's the long bout
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.760]   of cardiovascular training that I do once a week
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.380]   and long for me means 60 to 90 minutes
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.600]   and sometimes longer if it's a hike,
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.580]   which certainly doesn't require that much intensity,
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:56.640]   I suggest warming up for about five to 10 minutes
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.620]   and then limiting your total workout duration
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.300]   to about 50 minutes, maybe 60 minutes
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.580]   if that's what's required to complete what you need to do
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:06.340]   in order to keep with your exercise goals.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:10.100]   But to be very careful about exceeding 75 minutes
[01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.060]   of exercise in any one single exercise bout.
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.920]   And if you remember back to the beginning of the episode,
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.400]   when I said that I track what I do on a day-to-day basis,
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:20.560]   and I don't do it in a very detailed way,
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.280]   but I do take note of when I've gotten a bad flu or cold,
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.360]   I can tell you that in almost every single case
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.820]   where I've gotten a bad flu or cold,
[01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:31.580]   there are two things that have proceeded
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.920]   that bad flu or cold.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.640]   One is sleep deprivation.
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.880]   Typically it would be nights where I got two hours of sleep
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.040]   or less for more than one night, okay?
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.720]   The second thing is any time that I really pushed it
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.880]   with exercise and went all out and I went for 75 minutes
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.600]   and then I continued to 90 minutes
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.040]   and then maybe later that day, because somebody invited me
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.220]   on a run or something like that,
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.480]   I also did that second run or that second workout
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.880]   of some kind, could be running in the morning
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.600]   and weight training in the afternoon.
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.560]   Some people can do that kind of training
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.100]   on a regular basis even and not get sick.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.600]   I am not such a person.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.840]   I've managed to maintain fairly consistent fitness output,
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.160]   meaning the three cardiovascular
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.020]   and the three weight training sessions per week
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.480]   for more than several decades now.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.300]   And part of the reason I think I've been able to do that
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:22.740]   is because I don't ever push too hard for too long
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.360]   within a given workout.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.200]   So this is really a call for moderation
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.860]   in terms of the duration and intensity
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:29.340]   of the exercise that you're doing,
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:32.340]   but we're not talking about really being laid back.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.020]   We're not talking about easy workouts.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.780]   What we're talking about is an hour or less
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.500]   of moderate intensity to high intensity exercise,
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.500]   depending on the duration of that exercise,
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.700]   and keeping in mind that when you're doing that,
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:45.220]   you are activating that innate immune system.
[01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:48.040]   You're literally creating an immune response.
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.220]   You're increasing inflammation.
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:50.980]   You're increasing those cytokines.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.060]   You're increasing stress hormones.
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.520]   We have to start to think about exercise for what it is,
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.260]   which is a form of stress that induces adaptations.
[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:00.300]   Dr. Andy Galpin talked a lot about this
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:03.140]   in the series that he did on exercise physiology.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:05.280]   It's an excellent series that covers everything
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:07.700]   from strength to hypertrophy to speed to endurance,
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.240]   nutrition, supplementation.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:11.940]   You can find all that at HubermanLab.com very easily.
[01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:17.300]   Exercise is a very potent tool.
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.140]   We know that, we know that in the context
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.820]   of changing aesthetics, like body mass composition,
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.240]   increasing muscle, reducing fat.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.600]   We know that in the context of reducing resting heart rate,
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.620]   reducing resting blood pressure.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.860]   We know that in the context
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:30.460]   of all these other health metrics.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.680]   Here, we're talking about using exercise
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.560]   as a very potent tool to increase the function
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.740]   of the innate immune system to keep you healthy,
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:41.000]   not just through the winter months, but around the year,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.280]   and especially if you're getting less sleep.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.340]   If you're interacting with kids or adults
[01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:48.160]   that are carrying infections home from school
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.240]   or work on a regular basis,
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.900]   or maybe you even work in an environment
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.460]   like a hospital or a clinic
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:54.240]   where you're regularly interacting with patients
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.580]   that have these issues.
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.220]   One thing that I often get asked is,
[01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.460]   if I am sleep deprived, should I exercise?
[01:30:59.460 --> 01:31:01.900]   And that's a little bit of a tricky one.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:05.460]   My initial response for many years was, no, no.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:09.060]   If you're sleep deprived, you're better off not exercising.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.000]   However, I now need to qualify that answer
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.860]   because there are data showing that
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.180]   if you're sleep deprived and you exercise,
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:18.720]   especially if you exercise early in the day
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.580]   and it doesn't disrupt your sleep schedule,
[01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.980]   so it's not making you go to sleep
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:23.920]   even later the next night,
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.940]   that it actually can cause some adjustments
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.000]   in the function of your immune system
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.960]   and in the way that you regulate your blood sugar
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.040]   that offset some of the negative effects
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.120]   of sleep deprivation.
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:36.460]   That said, you should never ever compromise
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.240]   the amount of sleep you could get
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.740]   in order to get exercise such that you run yourself down.
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.580]   So what I'm really saying here
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:42.940]   is if you get one bad night's sleep,
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:45.060]   should you skip your workout and you feel like,
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:46.920]   ah, you know, I'm not feeling sick
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.940]   and should I work out or should I go back to sleep?
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:51.780]   Probably going back to sleep's the better idea,
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.420]   but if you don't have the option to go back to sleep
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.340]   for whatever reason, you can't fall back to sleep,
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:58.640]   then you would be wise to do a bout of exercise,
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:01.340]   but I would suggest reducing the intensity and duration
[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:05.060]   of that exercise by about 25%, maybe even 50%.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.720]   And that should allow you to offset
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:08.620]   any of the negative effects of sleep deprivation
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:09.560]   for that one night.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:13.140]   Keep in mind, exercise is not a replacement for sleep.
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.560]   And then to allow you to get to sleep
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:17.060]   at the appropriate time later that night
[01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:18.460]   and back onto a regular schedule,
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:20.420]   keeping your innate immune system tuned up
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:23.220]   and ready to combat any colds or flus.
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.780]   Now, one more point about exercise,
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.620]   and here we're also going to dovetail in
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:28.720]   an important point about nutrition.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:32.020]   In the review that I mentioned a few moments ago,
[01:32:32.020 --> 01:32:34.280]   they cover some of the data from studies
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:37.700]   exploring the post-exercise stress response.
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:40.700]   So this is the post-exercise induced increase
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:44.180]   in things like cortisol, those natural killer cells,
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.580]   the production of white blood cells, and so on.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:50.460]   It's very clear that if you are in a state
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.380]   of chronic stress because you're exercising a lot
[01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.440]   and or because you're not sleeping enough,
[01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:58.180]   or for whatever reason, maybe you have a lot of life stress,
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.480]   it's very clear that ingesting carbohydrates
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:05.180]   after exercise can help attenuate some of the inflammation
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:06.640]   that exercise induces.
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.780]   When we talk about carbohydrates,
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:11.480]   we're talking about rice, oatmeal, pasta,
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:14.820]   those sorts of things, so-called complex carbohydrates.
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:18.120]   And fruit post-exercise has been shown to attenuate,
[01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:21.920]   to reduce some of the markers of inflammation
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:26.920]   by about 30 to 40%, when contrasted with water only intake,
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.920]   especially if you're training fasted.
[01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.100]   So for those of you like me
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.700]   that like to wake up in the morning and just drink fluids,
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.560]   for me, it's water, yerba mate, coffee.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:37.500]   And by the way, I've said before
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.300]   that people should delay their caffeine intake 90 minutes
[01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:42.600]   if and only if they're experiencing an afternoon crash,
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.140]   but that if you are exercising first thing in the morning,
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.300]   it's perfectly fine to ingest your caffeine right away.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.580]   So that gives you an increase in energy for that exercise.
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.140]   That's certainly what I do on days that I exercise.
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.540]   But if you fast and then you're drinking caffeine
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:57.640]   and then you're exercising,
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.540]   and that exercise goes longer than 60 minutes,
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.820]   certainly if it goes longer than 75 minutes,
[01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.620]   you would do well to ingest some complex carbohydrates,
[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.500]   maybe also some fruit,
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.220]   perhaps not immediately after exercise,
[01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:12.780]   but within the 45 minutes or so or hour or so after exercise
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:15.780]   so that you're not ramping up those inflammatory molecules
[01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:18.860]   and leaving them ramped up for many hours
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.700]   into the morning and throughout the day.
[01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.060]   Because of course this episode
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:23.980]   is not about exercise and nutrition,
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:25.500]   but here we're talking about the role
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.420]   that exercise and nutrition play
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:28.940]   in helping us combat colds and flus
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.780]   by increasing the function of that innate immune system.
[01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:34.700]   And the reasons why carbohydrates can have this effect
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.660]   on cortisol, et cetera,
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.220]   is an interesting and important discussion into itself.
[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:40.780]   We'll leave it for another episode, but keep that in mind.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:41.820]   Also, I don't know about you,
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:43.340]   but a nice bowl of oatmeal, some fruit,
[01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:44.700]   and a protein drink or some eggs
[01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:48.140]   after an hour or so of exercise in the morning
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.820]   when I haven't eaten anything since the night before,
[01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:51.860]   it tastes really, really good.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:54.660]   So continuing with the theme of things that we can do
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.180]   at the level of behaviors
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.320]   to improve the function of our innate immune system
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.180]   and combat colds and flus,
[01:35:00.180 --> 01:35:03.900]   perhaps even prevent us from getting colds and flus at all,
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.540]   but certainly help combat them
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.720]   if they've initially made their way into our system,
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.600]   but we haven't developed full-blown symptoms
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.380]   and we want to prevent those full-blown symptoms,
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:16.860]   is the use of deliberate heat exposure, in particular, sauna.
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:17.960]   There's a nice study on this
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.100]   that was published very recently, 2023.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.200]   The title of the study is
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:25.860]   The Effects of a Single and Series of Finnish Sauna Sessions
[01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.340]   on the Immune System Response and Heat Shock Protein
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.800]   70 Levels in Trained and Untrained Men.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.980]   It's a very interesting study.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.780]   They compared athletically trained
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:35.940]   and non-athletically trained men.
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.980]   As most of you probably know,
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.920]   when you get into a hot sauna, heart rate increases,
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.420]   there's vasodilation,
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.300]   there's the increase in the release of heat shock proteins,
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.260]   there's the increase in things like dynorphin,
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.660]   which if it's sufficiently hot,
[01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:50.740]   are increased to levels
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.260]   that make us feel kind of agitated and not so good.
[01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:55.860]   We have to actively calm ourselves in the sauna,
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.420]   so we're not talking about an easy cruise
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:35:58.920]   at 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.240]   We're talking about getting up into the 180 degree
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:05.560]   Fahrenheit or 210 degree Fahrenheit range,
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:08.100]   maybe even higher if you're heat adapted.
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:12.200]   And the dynorphin makes you feel lousy in the short term,
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.160]   but that it upregulates
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.980]   a bunch of different biological mechanisms
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:17.500]   that give you kind of low level euphoria
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:20.380]   and actually the capacity to experience
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.520]   more feelings of wellbeing from the endorphins
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.400]   that you make after you get out of the sauna.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.180]   This is oh so important to understand
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:28.380]   whether or not we're talking about exercise
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:30.680]   or deliberate cold exposure, deliberate heat exposure.
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.460]   What happens during the heat exposure,
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:37.100]   cold exposure exercise is more often than not,
[01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:40.080]   just the trigger for the long-term adaptation
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:40.980]   that we're seeking.
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.300]   Just like exercise increases your heart rate
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.520]   and blood pressure,
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.760]   but then leads to reductions in resting heart rate
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.380]   and blood pressure and so on and so forth.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.260]   This study is interesting
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.080]   and there are a lot of different takeaways from this study
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:54.080]   because they compare these two different populations.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.540]   I'll just give you the top contour
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:57.740]   of what the protocol entailed.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.140]   There were 10 sauna sessions.
[01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.880]   Each of those sauna sessions
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.620]   were three rounds of 15 minutes of sauna.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:08.100]   So one session meant going into the sauna.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.140]   The sauna was of a given temperature,
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.160]   but I think for most people,
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.580]   what's going to work in terms of what parallels this study
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.820]   is going to be somewhere between 176
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.180]   and 210 degrees Fahrenheit,
[01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.820]   depending on how heat adapted you are.
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:21.140]   Always be safe, don't do this if you're pregnant,
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:24.060]   don't do this if you're a child, et cetera.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.600]   So they're doing three rounds of 15 minutes each
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.080]   separated by two minutes.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:28.920]   During that two minutes,
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:32.180]   they take a cool shower where they cool off in some way.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.580]   They're not going into a cold plunge,
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:36.580]   but they're cooling off with a cool shower.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:39.400]   And they're doing that three times, that's one session.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.260]   They do 10 sessions.
[01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.220]   Those sauna sessions were spaced apart
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:47.860]   by at least a few days and the entire experiment,
[01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:49.860]   meaning all 10 sessions were completed
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:51.280]   within a three week period.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.560]   And then a bunch of things were measured,
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:54.940]   like the amount of white blood cells
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:58.100]   and immune cells that were deployed after the first session
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:00.700]   versus the third versus the eighth versus the 10th
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.660]   and so on, as well as the levels of cortisol
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.740]   and inflammatory markers.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.800]   There are a lot of different things measured in this study.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.320]   Here's what we know.
[01:38:09.320 --> 01:38:11.300]   Sauna baths, as they're calling them,
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:13.620]   resulted in a statistically significant increase
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.960]   in cortisol concentration
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:18.640]   after the first and the 10th sauna session, okay?
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.160]   So every time you go into the sauna,
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.540]   you're getting an increase in cortisol.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.480]   We know that because the heat is a stressor.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.980]   Again, don't think about heat as,
[01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.240]   oh, you're just kind of relaxing in the sauna, it's so nice.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.620]   You're getting a cortisol response.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:34.620]   Cortisol is a glucocorticoid stress hormone,
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:37.020]   as it's sometimes called, which can be a good thing
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.780]   if it sets in motion a number of other things,
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.820]   such as the increase in the activity
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:41.820]   of the innate immune system.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:44.160]   And indeed that is what they observed.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.080]   After, and here I'm paraphrasing,
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:48.580]   after the first and 10th sauna baths,
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.860]   they witnessed an increase in leukocyte count.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.580]   Leukocytes are a particular type of cell
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.060]   of the innate immune system.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.500]   However, only after the last sauna session
[01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.300]   did this change reach statistical significance
[01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.580]   in the trained group.
[01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:05.280]   So what they observed was that athletes who are trained
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.180]   are used to being in high heat conditions
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.320]   because of their athletic training.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.320]   People who are not trained in athletics
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.220]   are not used to that.
[01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:14.860]   There are a lot of different ways to look at these data,
[01:39:14.860 --> 01:39:17.320]   but the simplest takeaway is that
[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.800]   if you are already very heat adapted
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.300]   because you do sauna regularly or you exercise regularly,
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.860]   well then it's going to take a stronger stimulus
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:30.280]   or more sauna, either longer or hotter or more frequent
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.700]   to get the sorts of increases in innate immune response
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.020]   as compared to someone who's never done sauna,
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.140]   who's not exercising regularly.
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.220]   And that just makes sense.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:41.840]   If something isn't stressful to you,
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.620]   you're not going to get the stimulation
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:45.260]   of that innate immune response.
[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:48.280]   And the overall takeaway from this study was that
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:52.060]   I do believe that if you're feeling run down a little bit
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:56.460]   or if you're just trying to keep colds and flus at bay,
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.140]   having some regular-ish practice of getting into the sauna
[01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.740]   for three rounds of 15 minutes
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.340]   separated by two minute cool off,
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.180]   you don't necessarily have to do a cold shower
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.420]   or a cold plunge in between,
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:09.660]   although I don't see why you couldn't or wouldn't,
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:11.060]   but you could also just get out of the sauna
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.420]   and be in the cool air and then get back in.
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.820]   Or perhaps you do something more akin
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.280]   to what's been shown in other studies
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.560]   that explore the relationship between heat exposure
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.360]   and immune response, which is to do two rounds of 20 minutes
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.160]   or one round of 30 minutes in the sauna,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.840]   whatever you can do safely and comfortably.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.100]   Keep in mind, safety is key.
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:28.940]   Don't harm yourself.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.300]   I say that not to protect me, but to protect you.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.480]   That sauna is an effective way
[01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:39.080]   of increasing the activity of the innate immune system.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.760]   It increases leukocyte levels.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.260]   Yes, it increases cortisol levels,
[01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.560]   but in a way that promote the activity
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.160]   of the innate immune system.
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:49.000]   However, and here we are back to exactly the same thing
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.580]   we said about exercise.
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:53.040]   If you're already feeling really run down,
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.000]   feeling kind of heaviness in the body, you don't feel well,
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.680]   you're starting to get some sniffles,
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.240]   don't get in a very hot sauna.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.640]   But for sake of keeping colds and flus at bay, sure.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.180]   Do three rounds of 15 minutes in the sauna
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:09.280]   between 176 degrees, 210 degrees,
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.080]   whatever you can safely tolerate.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.480]   Take those two minute breaks in between,
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.880]   maybe do a cold shower or coolish shower,
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.800]   maybe just stand outside the sauna in between.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.440]   If you're feeling really strong, do a cold plunge
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:21.880]   for a minute or two minutes in between.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.380]   You don't have to, but you certainly could.
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:25.920]   And then get back in and then repeat.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.100]   Or just do one 20 minute session or 30 minute session,
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.120]   all of which have been shown to promote the activity
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:32.640]   of the innate immune system.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.440]   However, and I realized I said this before,
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:35.940]   but I feel like I need to say it again,
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.160]   especially for you hardcore exercisers
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.580]   or people that really feel like, oh, I can push through.
[01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.740]   If you're already sick and you have the symptoms
[01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.760]   of a cold or flu, you want to limit the amount of stress
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:47.580]   to your body.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.360]   You want to get into bed and sleep.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.040]   If you can't sleep, you want to relax.
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.940]   You do not want to exercise.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.360]   You should not exercise.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.700]   Not only do you stand to get other people ill
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.180]   by going places where you exercise,
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.840]   but even if you exercise at home or in total isolation,
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:03.560]   you're going to prolong the duration of that illness.
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:05.560]   Because there are many, many reasons
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.380]   why being still, slowing your circulation,
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.360]   and allowing your innate, and then in that case,
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.120]   your adaptive immune system to kick in
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:14.380]   and combat those infections is going to get you back
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:16.400]   into a regular exercise and work regimen,
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.560]   much, much faster than would be the case
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.120]   if you were to push through.
[01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.440]   Okay, so now we get to the portion of the discussion
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.920]   that I think probably many people are anticipating,
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:30.600]   which is what can you take to reduce the probability
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.360]   of getting a cold or flu
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.980]   or shorten the duration of a cold or flu?
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.960]   And I actually put out a call on social media.
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.740]   I asked the question on Instagram and on X,
[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:42.560]   formerly called Twitter, you know,
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.880]   what do you do for a cold or flu?
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.320]   And what are you curious about
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.440]   in terms of what one can take for cold or flu?
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:51.240]   And I got thousands upon thousands of answers.
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:52.680]   However, many of those answers
[01:42:52.680 --> 01:42:54.360]   converged on some common things.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.160]   Things like taking garlic.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.440]   I heard, for instance, that some people
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:59.400]   are chewing a raw clove of garlic every day
[01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:00.900]   during the winter.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.760]   I heard about people who take fermented garlic.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.160]   Some people swear by echinacea.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:09.280]   Some people swear by echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.260]   Now, there are far too many compounds
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:13.120]   that exist in the wellness
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.720]   and indeed in the medical literature
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:15.880]   to cover all of them.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:17.180]   So I'm going to highlight a few
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:19.120]   that I think are especially interesting
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:21.520]   and that have been shown in peer-reviewed science
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.680]   to be potentially useful.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.960]   Some of these you've heard of before,
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.040]   and some of them I think are going to be surprising
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.800]   or at least new to you.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:32.160]   First, let's consider what most people believe
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.200]   to be a very effective way to hasten colds or flus,
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:39.320]   that is to make them last shorter duration of time
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.160]   than they would otherwise,
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.000]   maybe even prevent colds or flus.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.560]   The big one there is vitamin C.
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.300]   We hear all the time, vitamin C, antioxidant.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:48.680]   I grew up in an area
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:52.220]   where the Nobel prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling,
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.720]   who was a fanatic about vitamin C,
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.840]   he took many, many grams of vitamin C each day,
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:59.100]   used to tout the benefits of vitamin C.
[01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.840]   Here's the deal.
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:06.360]   There is some evidence, and it's not great, frankly,
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:10.360]   that points to the fact that taking six to eight grams,
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:14.000]   grams, so that's 6,000 to 8,000 milligrams
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.120]   of vitamin C per day.
[01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:16.820]   That is a lot of vitamin C.
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:22.980]   Each day can perhaps delay the onset of a cold
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:26.440]   or shorten the duration of a cold.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.980]   So here we're talking about very high doses
[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.560]   and not a very robust effect.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.680]   I should mention that for most people
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.280]   who aren't accustomed to taking much vitamin C,
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.860]   if you were to take six to eight grams of vitamin C
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:40.860]   in capsule or powder or pill form,
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:42.280]   chances are you're going to experience
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:44.840]   some significant gastric distress.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.000]   Some people can build up to that level
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.360]   or take it with food in a way
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.880]   that doesn't cause that gastric distress,
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.200]   but many people will experience gastric distress.
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.760]   There's been a lot said about vitamin C
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.920]   and its other potential roles in our physiology,
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.320]   and I don't want to touch on those now
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.000]   because it may have some interesting roles
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.600]   in other aspects of our physiology,
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:06.760]   but I have to say that in scouring the literature
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:10.680]   on vitamin C, I encountered a recent paper,
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:13.340]   so this was published in 2023,
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.360]   and the title of this paper is "Retraction."
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:20.300]   Extra dose of vitamin C based on a daily supplementation
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.400]   shortens the common cold,
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:24.260]   a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:27.240]   What is this paper that was recently published?
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:30.660]   Why is retraction the first word in the title?
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:33.640]   Well, it turns out that the meta-analysis
[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.280]   of nine randomized controlled trials
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:40.080]   showing a small but significant improvement
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.680]   in the outcomes for colds and flus
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:44.760]   or reduction in probability of getting colds and flus,
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.580]   that study was retracted,
[01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:51.280]   and it was retracted on the basis of multiple instances
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.720]   of an error in which the placebo groups
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.240]   had been double-counted in trials
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:56.560]   more than the two intervention arms,
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:59.600]   so there were some serious data analysis flaws
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:00.860]   in that meta-analysis.
[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:04.880]   Now, that is not to say that vitamin C is of zero benefit
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.880]   for reducing the probability of colds and flus,
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.720]   but I must say, provided that you're getting
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:13.080]   sufficient amounts of vitamin C from your food intake,
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.500]   maybe you also get a little bit
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:16.400]   in your vitamin mineral supplement,
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.440]   or if you take a foundational supplement
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.520]   like AG1 or something similar,
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.280]   almost certainly you're getting enough vitamin C,
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:27.400]   it does not seem that taking high doses of vitamin C,
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.660]   and I would place six to eight grams of vitamin C
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.000]   in the high dose range,
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.200]   is going to be effective for treating
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.880]   or preventing colds and flus.
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.240]   So more data may arrive in the near future,
[01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:40.720]   but vitamin C is probably not a very good investment
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.700]   if you're taking it solely for the purpose
[01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:45.320]   of enhancing your immune system function
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.560]   and staving off colds and flus.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:48.640]   Now, what about vitamin D?
[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.200]   We hear a lot these days about the importance
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.760]   of having sufficient vitamin D levels,
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.160]   and ideally everyone would get their vitamin D levels
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.080]   measured by regular blood tests.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.960]   I do get my blood work done every six months,
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.040]   I find it be incredibly informative,
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.040]   tells me what's going on below the hood
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:04.480]   in ways that I never could be aware of
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:05.580]   were I not to get that test,
[01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:08.140]   but I realized that there's a cost to those tests
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:09.840]   and not everyone can afford them.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:13.560]   I think most physicians would agree that
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.200]   supplementing with anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 IU
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.100]   of vitamin D per day is probably safe for most people
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.920]   and will buffer that level of vitamin D in their system,
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.680]   such that they're unlikely to be deficient
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:30.300]   and unlikely to far exceed what's safe in the body.
[01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:34.280]   However, there are people who need higher levels
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.540]   of vitamin D supplementation in order to achieve
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.780]   sufficient amounts of vitamin D for their mental health
[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:39.620]   and physical health.
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:41.760]   I mean, vitamin D is involved in a lot of different
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.660]   processes in the brain and body.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:48.900]   Now, it is clear that people who are vitamin D deficient,
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:50.540]   so these are people whose vitamin D levels
[01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:51.560]   have been measured,
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.800]   oftentimes have diminished immune system function
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:59.880]   and are more prone to acute respiratory tract infections.
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:02.340]   There's a very lengthy and very interesting review
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.780]   entitled "Vitamin D Supplementation to Prevent
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:06.500]   Acute Respiratory Tract Infections,
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.100]   Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.140]   of Individual Participant Data."
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.040]   This is a beast of a thing.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.540]   I did read it all.
[01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:14.380]   Very, very interesting.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:15.440]   Many, many studies.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:19.800]   The exact takeaways from a large review like this
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.240]   of 25 randomized control trials is a little bit tricky.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:26.500]   I mean, they did conclude that vitamin D supplementation
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.140]   did reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infection
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:31.140]   among all the participants.
[01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:35.140]   However, the degree of prevention
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.620]   was small to moderate in some cases.
[01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.960]   They did point out, however,
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.040]   that just because people with low levels of vitamin D
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.740]   tend to get colds and flus
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:45.900]   more often than people that don't,
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:49.860]   does not necessarily mean that vitamin D deficiencies
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:51.060]   are the reason for that.
[01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:53.140]   For instance, we know that people
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.260]   that get regular sunlight exposure,
[01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:58.060]   and as everyone knows, I'm a big, big proponent
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:01.380]   of getting sunlight in your eyes as early as possible
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:02.500]   in the day after waking up.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.860]   And if it's cloudy out to get even more time outside,
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:07.220]   if you can, and if you can't get access to sunlight
[01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:08.380]   for whatever reason,
[01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:11.460]   to perhaps invest in a 10,000 lux light tablet,
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:13.580]   you can find these online at reasonable cost,
[01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:16.000]   you know, $100 to $200 in some cases.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.780]   Getting sunlight sets in motion
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.580]   a huge number of different things,
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:26.840]   including increasing the amount of vitamin D in your system,
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.980]   but a bunch of other things as well.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:30.040]   Increases in cortisol, increases in dopamine,
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:33.720]   increases in serotonin that cascade toward
[01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:36.860]   and relate to improved immune system function.
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:38.900]   So what is the takeaway here?
[01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.620]   I think that for most people supplementing
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:44.420]   with 1,000 to 2,000 international units of vitamin D
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.100]   is probably safe.
[01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:48.200]   However, if you need more vitamin D,
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.900]   you won't know that unless you take a vitamin D test,
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:52.500]   that is you measure the amount of vitamin D
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.580]   in your bloodstream.
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.420]   And some people indeed need 5,000 to 10,000 IU
[01:49:56.420 --> 01:49:57.420]   of vitamin D per day,
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:00.460]   but you don't want to overdose yourself on vitamin D.
[01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:02.520]   That is if you already have sufficiently high levels
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.320]   of vitamin D in your system,
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.380]   you're getting sufficient sunlight,
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:10.660]   well then taking 10,000 or more international units
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:13.240]   of vitamin D could possibly be detrimental.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.180]   I think it's fair to say based on the meta analysis
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.700]   and review that I mentioned a moment ago,
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:21.820]   the other papers that I was able to glean
[01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:25.740]   that vitamin D itself is unlikely to be
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.840]   the sole protectant against colds and flus,
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.820]   but it's probably a good thing to include
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:33.020]   in your general kit of nutrition and supplementation tools
[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.580]   if your goal is to keep your innate immune system
[01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.080]   fighting off colds and flus sufficiently.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.580]   Other things that could perhaps support
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.040]   the innate immune system are going to be,
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:41.880]   as I mentioned earlier,
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.400]   the things that support the gut microbiome.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.060]   So those low sugar fermented foods,
[01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:46.900]   maybe a prebiotic probiotic capsule,
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:50.580]   maybe something like Athletic Greens AG1,
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:52.240]   although certainly you could achieve
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:55.820]   sufficient microbiome support from foods if you're careful
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.120]   and intentional about the foods that you select.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.760]   Now the other compound or substance that we often hear about
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:04.200]   in the context of colds or flus is echinacea.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.080]   Echinacea is a compound that has been proposed
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.780]   to improve immune system function.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:11.240]   Now, when you go into the data and you explore
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:13.400]   what does taking echinacea tinctures
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.480]   or other forms of echinacea really do
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:17.320]   to avoid colds and flus?
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.480]   The answer that comes back is not much, if anything.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.880]   Now, is taking echinacea dangerous?
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:23.720]   Probably not.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:26.540]   However, it has been shown in a few studies
[01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:29.840]   that people that take echinacea regularly at high doses
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.060]   can potentially impede the function
[01:51:33.060 --> 01:51:34.200]   of their innate immune system.
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.180]   That is reductions in white blood cell count,
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:38.320]   reductions in those natural killer cells.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.160]   So my suggestion would be,
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.920]   if you absolutely love echinacea for whatever reason,
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.160]   you're convinced that it helps you,
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.480]   that you reserve to taking it
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.040]   when you're starting to feel a little bit run down
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.920]   or perhaps just in the winter month,
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:51.080]   not months, plural, but month,
[01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.440]   when you're most prone to those cold and flu infections,
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.920]   but then not taking it continuously throughout the year
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:58.620]   and certainly not for more than four weeks at a time.
[01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.320]   But again, if you're doing that,
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.440]   just know that there aren't really
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.560]   any strong scientific data to support the use of echinacea.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:08.400]   By contrast, there are pretty darn good data
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.600]   that support supplementing with zinc
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.580]   as a way to combat colds and flus, in particular, colds.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:17.520]   Now, here, the dosages really matter.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.160]   It's been shown that if you take less than 75 milligrams
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.440]   of zinc in supplement form
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:26.420]   to try and impact the probability of getting
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.700]   or shortening a common cold, it's not going to work.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.960]   You need to take 100 milligrams or more.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.660]   And now 100 milligrams or more of zinc,
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:36.440]   for some people, is going to cause some gastric distress
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:38.280]   if you take it on an empty stomach.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.160]   I've actually made the mistake of taking,
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.720]   I think it was 50 milligrams of zinc on an empty stomach,
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:45.400]   and I felt really nauseous, did not feel well.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.160]   So don't take zinc on an empty stomach.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:50.160]   And if you're trying to shorten a cold or flu
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.640]   that you think you've already contracted,
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.520]   or you're trying to keep a cold or flu at bay
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.180]   'cause you were around people with colds or flus,
[01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.500]   or you're just worried about it,
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.040]   taking 100 milligrams of zinc,
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:01.820]   perhaps divide it up into two doses of 50 milligrams each,
[01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:03.400]   or maybe 100 milligrams all at once,
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:04.840]   but making sure that you take that
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.880]   with at least a moderately sized or full meal
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:09.440]   certainly could be advantageous.
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:12.240]   Keep in mind that people that are older than 65
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.580]   are perhaps the ones that need to supplement zinc the most.
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:17.400]   Also keep in mind that children,
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:21.220]   meaning people younger than 15,
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:23.640]   should probably not supplement with too much zinc.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:24.620]   It can be problematic.
[01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:26.900]   And certainly pregnant women should talk to their doctor
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.500]   before supplementing with zinc.
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.500]   Indeed, anytime you're going to take anything,
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:33.120]   whether or not you're young, old, pregnant or not,
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.340]   you should consult your physician before you take anything
[01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:37.480]   or remove anything from your health protocols.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:38.920]   One of the more interesting aspects
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.100]   of supplementing with zinc
[01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:41.980]   that I was able to find in the literature
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:45.540]   is a three times faster recovery rate
[01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:48.320]   for people that already contracted a cold.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.640]   So in this study, people weren't taking 100 milligrams,
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.160]   but the dosage came pretty close.
[01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:56.600]   They were taking 90 milligrams per day of zinc acetate,
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.040]   and they experienced a three times faster recovery rate
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.120]   from that cold compared to people
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.320]   who were not taking the zinc.
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:05.020]   Now, of course, there could be other factors as well,
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.880]   but the study was fairly convincing.
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.580]   So given that zinc is fairly low cost,
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.980]   given that it's generally safe for most people,
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.640]   and the fact that if you take it with food,
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.200]   it doesn't cause any discomfort,
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.040]   supplementing with zinc at a level of anywhere
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:22.120]   from 90 to 100 milligrams per day,
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:24.960]   probably no more than 120 per day,
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.000]   seems like a logical way to stave off colds and flus
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.500]   and reduce the duration of a cold or flu
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:31.700]   should you contract one.
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.840]   Now, I want to be very clear
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:34.520]   that I've been talking about colds and flus
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.420]   kind of in concert,
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:38.720]   kind of treating them more or less as the same thing.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:41.380]   Some of that is for sake of time and simplicity.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:43.420]   Most all of the studies showing a benefit of zinc
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.580]   are studies showing the benefit of zinc
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:48.820]   for the treatment or the hastening of colds,
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:50.700]   not for flus specifically.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:53.240]   However, I consulted with a few physicians
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.940]   and one of whom is expert in this area,
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.100]   and he said, "I didn't see any reason
[01:54:57.100 --> 01:55:00.060]   why you wouldn't take zinc if you had a flu."
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:00.900]   There's no reason to think
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:03.180]   that it would introduce any kind of increased risk,
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:05.280]   but again, consult with your physician before taking
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.560]   or removing anything from your supplement regimen.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.360]   Now, a lot of the compounds that we're discussing
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.340]   are sort of conventional in the sense that
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:13.500]   I think most people have probably heard of them already.
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.660]   Perhaps the most esoteric sounding one thus far
[01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.940]   is echinacea, which we established
[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:21.540]   probably not very helpful for colds or flus,
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.640]   but we've been talking about vitamin C,
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:24.940]   we've been talking about zinc, vitamin D,
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:26.100]   making sure you're getting your sunlight,
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:28.980]   supporting your microbiome, and so on and so on.
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:31.120]   One compound that I'm guessing most people
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:32.640]   perhaps have not heard of,
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.500]   but that is very interesting that in fact I've taken before
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:38.480]   and that I stock in my supplement cabinet
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.940]   in case I feel like I'm coming down with something,
[01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.600]   is N-acetylcysteine or NAC.
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:44.780]   What is NAC?
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:47.720]   NAC is a precursor to glutathione.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:48.880]   What is glutathione?
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:51.720]   Glutathione is the master antioxidant.
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.000]   It's involved in reducing
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.440]   what are called reactive oxygen species,
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.060]   which build up in cells that are very metabolically active.
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.380]   Reactive oxygen species build up even more
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:04.380]   in cells that are under stress or a body that's under stress.
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:06.520]   And it also has the property
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:09.280]   of reducing reactive nitrogen species.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:11.940]   Reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species
[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.760]   significantly increase under conditions of infection
[01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.460]   and having sufficient levels of glutathione is a good thing.
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:21.940]   Now, N-acetylcysteine is used in certain clinics overseas
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.060]   and in the US as a way to treat cystic fibrosis
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:27.100]   because it's also a mucolytic.
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.920]   And cystic fibrosis is the buildup of fluid in the lungs
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.920]   and a mucolytic substance is something
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.860]   that loosens up the mucus and allows it to flow more readily
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.320]   out of different cavities of the body,
[01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:40.880]   including the lungs, the nasal passages and sinuses.
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:45.040]   And indeed last winter, I did unfortunately get a cold.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.760]   I told you about once every 18 to 24 months, I get a cold
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.800]   and it was a pretty nasty one.
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.200]   I was feeling super congested.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:53.080]   At first, I thought it was an ear infection.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.280]   Pretty quickly, I realized I had a cold
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:57.720]   and I was feeling so congested, I wasn't sleeping well.
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.080]   And it was suggested to me to take N-acetylcysteine.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.280]   I ended up doing that at a dosage of anywhere
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.440]   from 600 to 900 milligrams, three times per day.
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.960]   So it was a 600 to 900 milligram capsule,
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:10.160]   depending on which brand I purchased.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:12.240]   A lot of different versions of this out there on the market.
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:14.520]   I took it morning, late morning and afternoon.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.140]   And indeed it is a powerful mucolytic.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.520]   The mucus just starts flowing out.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:20.680]   You better have an extra box of tissues handy.
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:23.340]   And that greatly relieved the pressure in my sinuses.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.240]   And the reason I liked using NAC is
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:29.640]   because I've actively avoided using decongestants
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.000]   that one can purchase over the counter.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.240]   Most decongestants are of the alpha-1 agonist variety.
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:36.320]   What's an alpha-1 agonist?
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.160]   It causes vasoconstriction.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:40.160]   That vasoconstriction can be beneficial
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:42.560]   in preventing some of the intense congestion
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:45.120]   that one gets when you have a sinus infection
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.840]   or a cold or a flu.
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:50.520]   But then when those decongestants wear off,
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.240]   one tends to get a rebound increase in congestion
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:55.340]   and it's really painful, headache, et cetera.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:57.840]   In addition, some over the counter decongestants
[01:57:57.840 --> 01:57:59.080]   can be habit forming.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:01.000]   Not necessarily addictive, but habit forming.
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.120]   And they don't seem to have
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:03.960]   any other positive health benefits.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.600]   So I prefer not to take decongestants if I can avoid it.
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.760]   I had a very good experience with NAC.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:14.760]   And the use of NAC, N-acetylcysteine, as a decongestant
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.880]   and also as a way to prevent getting colds and flus
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.480]   is not an entirely new idea.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.420]   In fact, there's a paper dating back to 1997
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:26.560]   entitled "Attenuation of Influenza-like Symptomology
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:29.100]   "and Improvement of Cell-Mediated Immunity
[01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.980]   "with Long-Term N-acetylcysteine Treatment."
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.520]   Now, in this study, they looked at people
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:36.040]   who were taking 600 milligrams of N-acetylcysteine
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.240]   twice per day for six months.
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.660]   And what they observed is that the people
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:42.280]   who took N-acetylcysteine
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.280]   had a significantly lower probability
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.820]   of contracting influenza.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:48.520]   Now, this is but one study.
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.960]   There've been a few other studies
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.120]   and unfortunately there isn't a large body of research
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:54.940]   looking at NAC as a preventive for colds and flus.
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:56.840]   But the data in this paper are interesting enough
[01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:01.160]   and I was compelled by them enough to seek out a physician
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:04.920]   who I noticed was answering my prompts on social media
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.000]   about what do you use for colds and flus?
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.400]   And when I put that out there, as I mentioned,
[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:10.200]   I got thousands of responses
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.920]   on both Twitter X and on Instagram.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.280]   And one particular physician
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.820]   who happens to have a YouTube account,
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.600]   his name is Dr. Schwelt.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.580]   He's a medical doctor.
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:20.460]   He works in an intensive care unit
[01:59:20.460 --> 01:59:22.080]   and he deals with a lot of patients
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.760]   who have different strains of flu.
[01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.760]   In fact, he was the one that cued me
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.240]   to the fact that this year,
[01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:29.440]   there seems to be a fair number
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.380]   of H1N1 flu virus going around.
[01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:33.200]   And remember the H1N1 flu virus,
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:35.520]   while it's not deadly to everyone,
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:37.200]   it can be quite severe in some people.
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:39.360]   So we do want to be on the lookout for
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:42.220]   and trying to avoid getting H1N1 if we can.
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:44.500]   I spoke to Dr. Schwelt.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.480]   He was very generous with his knowledge
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.920]   about N-acetylcysteine.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:50.520]   He did acknowledge, and I'll acknowledge again here,
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:52.240]   that it would be great to get more randomized
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.200]   control trial data on N-acetylcysteine.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:57.880]   But we did talk about this paper, this 1997 paper.
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:01.960]   And he did mention that he and other clinicians
[02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.080]   that are forced to be in the hospital
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.720]   dealing with patients all through the winter
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:06.760]   and all year long,
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:08.920]   they're getting bombarded with cold and flu exposure
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.200]   all the time,
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.760]   that they, meaning he and some of his colleagues,
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:16.260]   deliberately take N-acetylcysteine as a preventative
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:17.920]   to try and reduce the probability
[02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:19.280]   of getting colds and flus.
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:20.600]   And while we don't want to make too much
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:23.200]   of any one study or anecdotal data,
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:24.720]   which is what we're describing when I tell you
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.140]   about a physician who told me this
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:28.500]   or what I did and experienced that,
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.480]   I think it is worth paraphrasing the study
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.500]   that I mentioned before.
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:35.600]   NAC prevented the symptomatic forms caused by,
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:38.480]   here they're talking about the A, H1N1 influenza virus
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.340]   quite efficiently.
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:41.480]   Since the large majority of infected subjects
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:44.040]   in the placebo group, 79%,
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:46.360]   developed clinically apparent disease
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.900]   versus only 25% in the NAT group.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:52.020]   In other words, approximately 80% of people in the study
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:56.140]   who did not take N-acetylcysteine got influenza,
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:58.760]   whereas only 25% of the people
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.860]   who were taking N-acetylcysteine contracted influenza.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:03.540]   So that's a fairly dramatic difference.
[02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:06.140]   And certainly the fact that N-acetylcysteine
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:08.300]   has been shown to increase glutathione,
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:11.640]   that's its primary mechanism of action as far as we know,
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:14.940]   and the fact that increases in glutathione
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:16.580]   are generally healthy and good for us,
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:20.020]   and the fact that N-acetylcysteine is still available
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:21.660]   legally over the counter in the US,
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:25.020]   at least currently it is, some years back,
[02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.460]   as you may have heard,
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.980]   the FDA called for removal of N-acetylcysteine
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:30.840]   from over the counter sales.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.720]   That I should point out was based on the fact
[02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:35.380]   that certain supplement companies were making claims
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:38.360]   about N-acetylcysteine as a treatment for hangover
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:39.580]   and making a bunch of other claims
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:41.620]   for which there was no real data,
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:43.600]   but either because the FDA was effective
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.980]   in getting those companies to cease those claims
[02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:47.900]   and/or because of advocacy groups,
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:51.800]   which worked very hard to try and keep N-acetylcysteine
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.680]   available for over the counter sales.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.520]   As far as I know,
[02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.340]   at least right up until prior to recording this episode,
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:02:00.980]   N-acetylcysteine is available for sale over the counter.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.420]   So whether or not you decide to use N-acetylcysteine
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.580]   as a preventative,
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:07.480]   and there again, the dosage is about 1200 milligrams per day
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.220]   divided into two different dosages of 600 milligrams each,
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.780]   or if you decide to take N-acetylcysteine
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:15.740]   in the manner that I did, which was not as a preventative,
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.020]   but once I had a cold, couldn't fight it off,
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.260]   apparently got the cold,
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:22.820]   decided to take 900 milligrams three times per day,
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:24.420]   avoiding that intake close to sleep
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:26.140]   because it did disrupt my sleep
[02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:27.540]   if I took it too close to sleep
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:30.060]   because of the way that the mucus would flow so readily.
[02:02:30.060 --> 02:02:31.880]   You know, essentially, I know it sounds gross,
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:33.560]   but I felt like it was filling up the back of my throat,
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:34.720]   so-called post-nasal drip,
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:36.620]   but it felt like post-nasal waterfall.
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:39.380]   And I decided to restrict my intake of N-acetylcysteine
[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:41.340]   to earlier in the day only.
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:42.840]   And of course, there's the third option,
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:45.420]   which is that you opt to not take N-acetylcysteine
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:48.280]   until more randomized control trials are published,
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:49.800]   or not take N-acetylcysteine at all
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:51.900]   because you're of the sort that thinks,
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:54.420]   okay, with some sleep, a hot shower, a good meal,
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:57.440]   some chicken soup, maybe a little garlic, who knows?
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.580]   Maybe you have some other tools and techniques
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:01.780]   that you like, you like that ginger tea, lemon, et cetera.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:03.380]   Maybe that's all you need.
[02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:05.660]   And if that's all you need and that's all you want
[02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:08.940]   in order to deal with a cold or flu, be my guest.
[02:03:08.940 --> 02:03:11.260]   I certainly am not here to convince anyone
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:13.020]   that you have to take a certain supplement,
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:15.080]   but I did feel like I would be remiss
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:17.820]   if I didn't cover what are generally referred to
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:20.340]   as the so-called preventatives and treatments
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:23.400]   for colds and flus, things like zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:26.260]   We now know that unfortunately, vitamin C gets a,
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:28.920]   probably a D- or an F at least as the data stand now,
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:30.940]   but there are these other things like zinc
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:34.900]   and potentially N-acetylcysteine that can be beneficial
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:37.880]   in shortening the duration of colds or flus
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:39.940]   and perhaps even helping us avoid
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:42.440]   getting colds or flus all together.

[02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:15.860]   During today's episode and on many previous episodes
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:18.520]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.720]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:22.760]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.240]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:26.040]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:27.640]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.840]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.380]   please go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S.
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:34.340]   So that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.760]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:39.360]   I'm @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.840]   So that's Twitter, now called X, Instagram,
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.960]   LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.760]   And on all of those social media platforms,
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:48.120]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.600]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:52.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, much of which, however,
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:54.400]   is distinct from the content on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:57.760]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.960]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:01.320]   to the Huberman Lab Podcast Neural Network Newsletter,
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:02.440]   the Neural Network Newsletter
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.520]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.360]   that provides podcast summaries and what we call toolkits.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.640]   Those toolkits are brief PDFs that describe protocols
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:13.960]   for everything from exercise to deliberate cold exposure,
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.280]   regulating dopamine, optimizing sleep, and on and on.
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.280]   All the newsletters are available in full,
[02:05:19.280 --> 02:05:21.760]   completely free of cost.
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.240]   To sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:26.320]   go to the Menu tab, scroll down to Newsletter,
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.400]   and enter your email.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:29.620]   And I want to emphasize that we do not share your email
[02:05:29.620 --> 02:05:30.600]   with anybody.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.500]   I'd like to thank you for today's discussion
[02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:35.020]   about the biology of colds and flus,
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.920]   about the biology of the immune system,
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.840]   and how to avoid and treat colds and flus.
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:42.080]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.920]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:46.500]   (upbeat music)
[02:05:46.500 --> 02:05:49.080]   (upbeat music)
