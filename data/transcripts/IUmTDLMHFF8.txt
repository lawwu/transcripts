[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   [Music]
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.700]   Alright, let's see here. We got a question
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.500]   from Mark.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.200]   Mark, who describes himself as from Utah, the gateway to Colorado.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.600]   What's, Jesse, is that like, uh,
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200]   Utah,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   self-hating Utah? What is that, like, self-deprecation?
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.000]   Is there, like, an--
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500]   I couldn't tell. I was thinking maybe he goes to Colorado a lot. I mean, maybe he drives.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.700]   This is like a pro-- this is like a pro-Colorado partisan, anti-Utah guy.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.500]   Alright, so here's what he asks.
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.600]   "What are you learning from people
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.300]   who apply your work?
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.600]   You have to be hearing good things from people who are reading and applying the principles in deep work.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.100]   I'd love to hear them. Also,
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.500]   what are the important things that you can learn from your book that you wish
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100]   your fans/cultist
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100]   could learn?"
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.100]   Well, the only place I have cultish followers, I think, is in that
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.400]   Utah.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.600]   Because they--
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700]   it just really--
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500]   they really suck. If only--
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.100]   here's what I always say, and Jesse knows this.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.900]   If only Utah could just be more like Colorado.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.000]   Then we'd see-- what I'm doing here, Jesse, is I'm pandering to, uh,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.600]   to this question asker.
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.800]   Okay, so what-- what have people learned from deep work, and what--
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.100]   what did they not learn that I wish they-- what have I learned about the book?
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's a good question.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.400]   Well, Jesse, you're-- you do some deep work. What have you learned?
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000]   What's your real-world experience with trying to be deeper?
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.200]   I think it goes hand-in-hand with all the podcast episodes that you put out in the other books.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.600]   I mean,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.100]   working on stuff,
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.600]   you know, without distraction.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   You get--
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.900]   you get a lot more done.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.100]   Essentially,
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.000]   closing down your email.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.300]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.100]   Not checking that all the time.
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200]   You know, just having certain times where you check that.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.900]   I would say that's pretty consistent.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.000]   Like, people will say,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.900]   when-- however I do it,
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.400]   when I'm able to be more sequential,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600]   and when I do hard things, just do the hard thing without context switching until I'm done.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.700]   You hear this a lot.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.300]   They say,
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.500]   "I get so much more done."
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.300]   I-- I would say that's pretty consistent.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600]   Your "Face the Dragon" motto is really solid, too.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.000]   Like, that hit home with me.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   I have it on my board at home, so I see it and--
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.900]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.100]   And that's relevant, right?
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.100]   I mean, with "Face the Dragon," what I'm-- what I'm saying is,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.300]   look at everything on your plate.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   Like, don't run away from it.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.500]   Look at everything on your plate,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500]   and I call it the "Productivity Dragon."
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Face the Productivity Dragon."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And here's the thing.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.800]   If it is
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.000]   inconquerable,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.600]   then you have to see it and confront it.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.700]   And-- and for a lot of people,
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.800]   that's why I'm glad you brought it up, Jesse,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.900]   what that leads to is they face the Productivity Dragon.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.200]   So they've written down everything.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.800]   A lot of times what'll happen is they write down everything,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.400]   and then they try to come up with a strategy for,
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.600]   "How do I deal with all of this?"
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.400]   They start trying to build out their autopilot schedule,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.100]   and, "I'll work on this here and this here,"
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.600]   and it just doesn't work because it's just way too much stuff.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.100]   And what that leads them to do is to say,
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   "Oh, I'm going to cut out half of this stuff."
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.000]   And then the other thing that's great is,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.800]   with your time block planner, you showed how,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.200]   if certain things go over, you cross out your existing plan
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.400]   and just start a new one, you know, on the same day.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.300]   So there's oftentimes where
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.100]   I'll be doing stuff and run out of time, and it's--
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.300]   as slow productivity as you talk about,
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   you just wait till the next day.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.600]   And then try to factor it in.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.100]   I like that.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.500]   You had a plan, you were intentional,
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.100]   you've won the game.
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.000]   I mean, no, there is no gold stars for,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.100]   "Wow, you came up with a time block plan,
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.600]   and you hit it exactly."
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Or, "You came up with a weekly plan or a--
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.000]   or even worse, a quarterly plan
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.500]   about how this thing was going to unfold,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.800]   and you hit it exactly."
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.400]   No one comes along and says,
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   "Great, you get extra money,
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   you get extra sales for your book,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   you get, you know, gold bars," or something like that, right?
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.000]   What matters is,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.200]   are you being intentional with your time?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.000]   Because who cares?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   If you get it right or not,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.900]   is--
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.500]   all that tells you is it's a little bit of luck,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.700]   and how good are you at guessing how long something takes?
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.300]   But in the end, it's going to take however long it takes.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.500]   And so the key thing is that you're working on something
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.400]   consistently and with intention
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.900]   until it's done, and it gets done well.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.300]   Whether you guessed properly how long that was going to take
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.000]   or not is not that important.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.600]   The automate--
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.700]   the automation stuff and finding different environments
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.800]   for different work is awesome.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.300]   Like, I'm taking Spanish lessons right now,
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.900]   so I know like certain days I'm going to do my homework,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.000]   you know, in a different spot.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.600]   All right.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   And it's just, you know, done.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.100]   All right, so good.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.600]   So we have three things so far
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.500]   about applying deep work in the real world,
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   what people have learned.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   So in particular, what Jesse has learned.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.700]   Facing a productivity dragon is important.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.400]   Intention trumps accuracy.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.000]   The key is that you have plans.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.600]   Don't beat yourself up if you don't have plans.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.200]   And then three, Jesse is saying the idea of having set times
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.600]   and places you do set work is a hack that really works
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.200]   pretty well.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.400]   Where's your Spanish lesson environment or ritual?
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.900]   It depends on the day.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.100]   This Saturday, I'm going to do it.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.600]   I'm going to do it tomorrow morning at, you know,
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.800]   at a separate desk in my house and then not at the same desk
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.500]   that I do something else.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.700]   Which is a good point.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.800]   Sometimes it's minor.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   We talked about this in a recent episode.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.900]   Yeah, we were telling someone to put a second desk in the
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.700]   same room.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.900]   It doesn't have to be dramatic.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.900]   Yeah, you don't have to fly down to Mexico every Saturday
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.300]   to do your Spanish lessons.
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's just this is the place I go to do my Spanish lessons,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.900]   even if it's a different desk in my same house.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.600]   Yeah, and then even listening to your interview with Ferris
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.500]   yesterday and you were talking about going down to DC,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   going to the Botanical Garden, stuff like that.
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.600]   I mean that type of stuff I've factored into to like the way
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.400]   I do things like going to like the local library or going
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.600]   to some other things that do going to different coffee
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.500]   shops to do something and then if you do that for an hour
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.200]   it adds up, keep on doing it.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.800]   That's one of the, that's a slow productivity plug as well.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.500]   It's one of the things that goes in my life when I get near
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   that chronic overload threshold.
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.000]   Like right now I'm near that chronic overload threshold
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.300]   because I'm helping with a few university initiatives,
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.400]   which I think are very important.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.600]   So I'm doing this by choice, but it's a lot of stuff
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   I don't typically like involving Zoom and PDF files, right?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.400]   It, the overhead of that gets to the point where you no longer
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.900]   have those half days free or those full days free where
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.500]   I would say I'm going to go down to DC and like think about
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.600]   one problem for most of the day and that's a real slow
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.100]   productivity thing that when you, when your load is reasonable,
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.200]   you can do things like I'm going to go down to a museum
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   and work and then go walk through the galleries to get inspired
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.900]   and then go work some more and move around the city and
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.100]   make a whole day about it.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.900]   You can't do that anymore when you're overloaded, but
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.100]   when you can do that, you're going to produce something
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.500]   cool at the end of that year.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.400]   When you can't do that, you're going to get a lot of Zoom
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.600]   meetings done and get a lot of PDF files read, but it's
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.700]   like me right now, month whatever of working on my book
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.100]   proposals, they're still not done, which what I probably
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.000]   need is just a couple days at the botanical garden.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   So yeah, it's an argument for slow productivity.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.000]   If you don't have the space to take a slow day to work
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.900]   on one project, you probably have too many projects.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.800]   All right, so that's good.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.900]   So there we go.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.200]   That is, there is straight from, straight from the mouth
