[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.280]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm talking
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.860]   to one of my favorite authors, Derek Sivers.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   He has a seemingly unlimited arsenal
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.900]   of incredible life advice that comes
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.000]   from one of the most unconventional life paths
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.680]   I've ever come across.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.200]   He started his career as a professional musician,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.880]   ended up joining the circus for almost 10 years
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.140]   until he started CD Baby, which became the largest seller
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.000]   of independent music on the web in the early 2000s
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.360]   with over $100 million in sales.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.960]   In 2008, he sold the company, giving away most
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.340]   of the proceeds to charity, and has been focused
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.280]   on a life of creating and learning ever since.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.740]   We're all fortunate for that path
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.520]   because of the amazing writing he's done since then.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.440]   So today, I'm gonna try to give you a glimpse
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.120]   at that wisdom as it relates to decision-making,
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.520]   aligning your actions with your personal values,
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.380]   living a more satisfying life,
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.960]   creating meaningful experiences, and a lot more.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.600]   We'll also talk about why Derek thinks traveling
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.880]   with children is easier
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.640]   than just about any other parent I've met.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.760]   It's a lot to cover,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.840]   and I really hope you enjoy this episode.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.940]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.040]   With the tax filing deadline around the corner,
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.000]   you're probably dreading sifting through all the paperwork
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600]   to find those donation receipts,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.760]   or wondering if you missed out on maximizing
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.960]   one of the most generous tax deductions,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.600]   charitable contributions.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.920]   Well, thanks to Daffy, I never have to go digging
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.840]   through emails or desk drawers to find my donation receipts,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.480]   and I'm proud to be partnering with them for this episode
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.040]   because they've helped me be more intentional with my giving
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.720]   and maximize the tax benefits of charitable giving
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.000]   all in one place.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.420]   Daffy is a modern platform and app for charitable giving,
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.960]   allowing you to give to any 501(c)(3) across the US
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.400]   with just a few taps.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.780]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.980]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.520]   and you can easily automate and optimize your giving.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.720]   Daffy does all of that by helping you set up
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   a Donor Advised Fund, or DAF,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.800]   which is a tax-advantaged account
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.620]   that lets you contribute cash, stock, or crypto
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.960]   on a one-time or recurring basis,
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000]   take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.460]   and then distribute that money
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.040]   to over 1.5 million charities, schools,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.460]   and faith-based organizations whenever you want to.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.720]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy

[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.960]   - Derek, thanks for being here.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.400]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.700]   - So from the outside looking in,
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.080]   when I read everything you write,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.920]   I'm like, "Gosh, this guy has it all figured out."
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.160]   And for every aspect of life, I'm always like,
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.640]   "Ah, there's probably a post Derek wrote.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.120]   I could just search up about this thing.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.160]   I'm trying to make a decision or be a better parent."
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280]   Do you feel like you have everything figured out?
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.020]   - I'm an explorer.
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.020]   So at any given moment, I might have figured out right now,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.460]   or I might've figured out yesterday's exploration
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.500]   and what I want to do about it,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.820]   but then give it a few days and I'm off to somewhere new.
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.580]   - I wanna make a bit of a theme of this
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.580]   because I think the average person listening
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.520]   isn't comfortable with that level of exploration
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.360]   in their life.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.960]   How do you get comfortable saying,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.540]   "Well, maybe I don't have to have this job.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.340]   Maybe I don't have to live in this place,"
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.420]   and reframing it around what you wanna do in the moment
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.100]   or what you should be doing?
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.820]   Is there a thing, maybe a tappiness
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.100]   that you kind of use to guide your exploration?
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.900]   - Intellectual interest, but also I'm usually led
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.820]   by whatever it feels I'm lacking now.
[00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.940]   And it sounds weird to put that so bluntly,
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.900]   but say you might be living in the middle of a city
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.300]   and you're too hectic and you're too booked up
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.660]   and you've got too many things going on
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.620]   and you think, "Ah, if only I could go live
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.380]   in the middle of nowhere in the country."
[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.060]   And so you do that, you make some changes in your life,
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.980]   you make your job remote or whatever it may be,
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.660]   and then you move off to the middle of nowhere
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.340]   and you get there and you go, "Ah, I've done it."
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.800]   And after a week or a month, you go,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.300]   "Yeah, I kind of miss a little commotion," you know?
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.460]   And so you start pursuing something
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.460]   to put a little commotion back in your life.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.460]   I think we're often driven by what we feel
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.140]   that we're lacking right now.
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.980]   And so I do that too.
[00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.460]   It's like the pendulum swinging.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.860]   You know, the pendulum goes too far off to one end
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.100]   and it kind of goes, "Ah, I wish I had a little gravity
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.460]   bringing me back to the center."
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.780]   And so the pendulum swings back to the center,
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.380]   but then it keeps swinging to the other end
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.820]   and it goes, "Ah, yeah, I wish I had something
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.500]   bringing me back there again."
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.340]   So that's probably driving a lot of my pursuits,
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.340]   but let's say that combined with the intellectual curiosity
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.980]   drives to just try something new.
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.420]   - Now, if we rewind, you said the person living in the city
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.060]   feels overwhelmed, so they move to the middle of nowhere.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.020]   I imagine that most of those people
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.780]   are actually not gonna do the move.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.580]   I think most of the people probably get stuck
[00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580]   in a situation saying, "I'm living in the city.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.020]   Everything's overwhelming.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.980]   Wouldn't it be nice to go just disconnect for a month,
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.740]   but I just can't do that."
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.580]   So I wanna rewind to that narrative and say,
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.300]   how have you been the kind of person
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.940]   that's been able to do that?
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.820]   When so many people, six months later,
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.980]   are still saying, "I'm still in the city.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.260]   I'm still overwhelmed.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.060]   I'm still frustrated in my job."
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.820]   Is there some thing that you've unlocked
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.220]   that allows you to do what so many people can't?
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.380]   - Hmm, I think I've always pursued that,
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.860]   even since I was a teenager.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.980]   Now, hold on, you said one key thing in there.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.020]   You said like three months later or six months later.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.340]   It might take a couple years.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.380]   When I was 25, I was a touring musician
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.540]   playing the college market in the Northeast,
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.580]   and I decided to move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.620]   And I did it, kinda like the little scenario I just described.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.740]   I had enough of New York City.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.700]   I had been living right in the middle of New York City
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   for like five years, six years,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.940]   and I was just like, "I've had enough.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.580]   I wanna move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.260]   I think that's my place."
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.820]   And so I just did it.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.700]   I just drove up there one day.
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.540]   I went straight to the Century 21 real estate office,
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.900]   and I said, "Show me what you got.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.500]   I wanna live here now."
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.220]   And she showed me something, and I was like,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.100]   "I could afford it."
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.780]   So I said, "Okay, I'll take it."
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.180]   And got rid of my life in Queens, New York,
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.500]   and moved to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.420]   And about a month later,
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.740]   I was at a gig in Rhode Island somewhere,
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.980]   and Renee, this redhead who had hired me for the gig,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.100]   I had known her from before.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.540]   Like she had hired me like two years earlier.
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.300]   And she said, "Oh my God, good to see you again.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.140]   How's it going?"
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.140]   And I said, "Well, I just moved to Woodstock."
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.900]   And she goes, "Get out.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.660]   No way.
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.660]   Derek, oh my God, that's amazing."
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.540]   And I said, "What?
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.460]   Why do you?"
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.980]   She's like, "Derek, don't you remember?
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.900]   You told me this."
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.460]   I said, "No, I just moved last week."
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.220]   She goes, "Yeah, two years ago,
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.260]   you told me you wanted to move to Woodstock."
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.180]   I said, "I did?
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.140]   I don't even remember wanting to move there two years ago."
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.420]   She goes, "Yeah, oh my God, two years ago,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.860]   you told me you wanted to move to Woodstock.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.700]   You did it.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.540]   That's amazing."
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.020]   I went, "Oh, wow.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.980]   Wow, I guess I've been wanting this a long time."
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.420]   So sometimes I think it goes like that.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.940]   It might take a couple of years
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.780]   for your intention to turn into reality.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.900]   - So maybe just accepting that everything doesn't have
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.980]   to move as fast as we expect it to,
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.940]   especially in a professional setting.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.740]   I know you are well-known for saying
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.020]   that you try not to just give your first answer
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.940]   if someone asks you a question,
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.900]   not to just quick, immediately react.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.100]   I think maybe we live in a world
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.660]   where that's kind of not the way we default operate.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.820]   So if I'm overwhelmed and I feel like I need to move,
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.780]   I don't think, how could I slowly transition my life
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.460]   to be able to move in a year or two?
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.700]   I think, could I move tomorrow?
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.540]   No, oh, I could never move.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.780]   Okay, but there are some things in life
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.340]   where doing it tomorrow is the right choice.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.540]   Here's a more recent example.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.780]   And I know this doesn't sound like a big deal,
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.700]   but I'm living here in New Zealand now
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.100]   and I was missing social interactions.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.940]   New Zealand's quite isolated.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.140]   And I used to attend a lot of conferences,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.060]   like whether it was a TED conference
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.940]   or music conferences or tech conferences.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.420]   And I kind of miss having a bunch
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.020]   of new random people in my life.
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.660]   I kind of miss that thing where you'd go to a conference
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.900]   and meet like 50 people in two days.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.060]   And because I missed that, I was like,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.500]   I'm gonna make that happen.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.540]   I'm gonna go just do that myself.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.020]   So I booked a trip to India,
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.100]   specifically Chennai and Bangalore,
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.020]   two cities where I know there are a lot of people
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.460]   in my database that I've never met face-to-face.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.620]   And I sent an email saying, all right,
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.660]   I'm coming to Chennai and Bangalore for 10 days.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.500]   Who should I meet?
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.980]   And used a little scheduling program
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.300]   and I booked in like nine meetings per day
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.420]   with strangers for six days straight,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.380]   met with about 55 people.
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.860]   And I just got back a couple of days ago
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.020]   and it was intense and wonderful.
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.780]   And I came back and I was telling a friend about it.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.860]   And she said the same thing that you said.
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.620]   I'm just like, God, you just kind of have an idea
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.260]   and then you just go make it happen.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.180]   That's amazing.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.020]   And yeah, that was a sweet compliment from an old friend.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.460]   And it was kind of funny to hear you
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.940]   just say a version of that right now.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.180]   So I guess this is something
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.020]   like my moving to Woodstock example
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.060]   that I think I've just made it a priority.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.900]   Also, maybe I've always kept my life quite light,
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.020]   meaning I try not to get into situations
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.660]   that bind me to a place.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.460]   I try not to own much stuff.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.180]   So it's just dead easy for me to move.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.060]   I can pack up my whole house and move in a day.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.540]   That's just been a priority for me.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.860]   But that's not to say that everybody should be like that.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.620]   Some people get deep joy out of having a home
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.860]   with their sofa that they love
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.380]   and their piano and their things.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   And it would be hard for them to move,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.420]   but that's fine 'cause they get deep joy
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.340]   out of having that deep sense of home
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.620]   and all of these belongings
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.860]   that belonged to their grandparents and all of that.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.460]   I'm not saying everybody should be nomadic,
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.700]   but when you're asking how have I done that,
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.660]   that's my answer.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.780]   - I'll go back and say what you did with India
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.420]   was something that I think some people might think,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.500]   gosh, I really miss all these people.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.180]   I live in a place that's kind of remote.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.180]   I don't see a lot of people.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.420]   I'm pretty nomadic capable and I don't own a lot of things.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.940]   Maybe I should move somewhere.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.100]   And you said, no, maybe I'll just take a trip
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.660]   to get that kind of fix, if you will.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.500]   So I wanna talk a little bit
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.420]   about how you think about making decisions.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.060]   The decision in someone's mind might be,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.100]   oh, I'm not able to do what I want.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.980]   Obviously I need to move somewhere
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.340]   where I can have more of a balance,
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.900]   let the pendulum go back in the middle.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.020]   And you said, well, maybe there's an alternative.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.300]   Maybe I could go get this deep, intense fix for 10 days
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.460]   that'll hopefully give you a little high
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.380]   of human interaction for a period to come and sustain you.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.980]   When you approach decision-making,
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.180]   it sounds like you don't just look at
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.980]   what's the assumed default option of what I could do.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.380]   You try to really make sure you're casting a wide net
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.380]   at ways to experience things.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.220]   - Yes.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.700]   It's one of my favorite things is to be reflective
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.420]   and ask yourself what you really want
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.420]   and not just limit yourself to a few options
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.220]   from what you see other people doing,
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.580]   but to really kind of dig deep and go like,
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.540]   okay, what do I really want and why do I want that?
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.100]   What's the real point of that?
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.060]   So if I think I want to be on a beach in Thailand right now,
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.380]   well, why do I think that?
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.220]   What do I really want?
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.900]   What do I expect will happen when I get there?
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.540]   Why is it that I need a beach in Thailand?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.740]   Could it be a beach anywhere?
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.620]   Is it just the quiet that I want?
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.180]   And you may keep asking yourself these questions
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.820]   and get to the actual answer,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.260]   which is that, yeah, my home is too noisy.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.620]   I hate all the clamoring here.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.500]   I live right above a train station or something
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.100]   and it's too noisy in my home.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.980]   Really what I'm pursuing is the silence.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.700]   Well, do you need to go to Thailand to get silence?
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.460]   Is that the sustainable solution to that?
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.860]   No, maybe I need to soundproof my office.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.620]   And you might come to like,
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.060]   yeah, actually I don't need Thailand,
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.380]   but the money it would take to go to Thailand,
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.300]   I could soundproof my office.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   And I really do like living here in Toronto
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.460]   or wherever it is.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.140]   In fact, I'm gonna stay here,
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.660]   not go to Thailand and soundproof my office.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.260]   Yes, that's what I really want.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.100]   If you keep digging into yourself,
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.620]   you might come out with a solution
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.900]   that suits your problem better.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.740]   - Is there something you do,
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.980]   maybe it's natural for you,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.660]   I have to assume it is,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.420]   where someone asks you a question or you have an idea
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.820]   and you're able to force yourself to pause
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.700]   and think before kind of going all in on this thing.
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.100]   Someone says, oh, do you wanna go here?
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.700]   And you're like, and my default is,
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.860]   do I wanna do this thing or not?
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.100]   Not, oh, what are these other options?
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.420]   Someone asks a question.
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.940]   My default is, do I know the answer or not?
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.500]   And if I think I know it, let's answer it right away.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.500]   I don't have the natural instinct to pause and think before.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.060]   And I'm curious,
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.460]   is there something that you've trained yourself to do?
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.660]   Is it natural?
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.500]   Have you thought about how people
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   who maybe don't have that instinct could adopt it?
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.940]   I think it would be beneficial to me,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.780]   which is why I'm asking.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.300]   - Well, I journal like crazy.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.140]   - Okay.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.660]   - I journal so much.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.860]   Unlike the other things where I say,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.620]   hey, you know, not everybody has to do this.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.380]   Everybody has to do this.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.700]   Everybody should do this.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.220]   It helps so much to pause.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.540]   And it doesn't even matter what,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.420]   pen, paper, text file, Google Docs, doesn't matter.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.420]   Something where you can stop like every day
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.220]   and ask yourself these reflective questions.
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.980]   Like ask yourself questions like,
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.060]   why am I doing this?
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.820]   And what am I really after?
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.420]   What's the point of that?
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.940]   And then you should doubt yourself.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.300]   You should doubt the answers you give yourself.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.700]   So even if you say, why do I want this?
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.660]   Because I've always wanted to go to Thailand.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.900]   Challenge yourself, right?
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.060]   Really, have I always wanted to go to Thailand?
[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.180]   Really, always?
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.260]   Why do I think that Thailand is the answer?
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.100]   Like push back on your own answers.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.420]   And it can take just an hour of your day.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.100]   And it is so, so useful.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.660]   And if you say that I don't have an hour in the day,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.540]   well, the hell you don't, you know?
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.380]   Like turn off other things and do this
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.300]   because where it takes you
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.300]   makes all the difference in the world.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.540]   - And are there prompts that you use
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.100]   or is it just whatever's happening in the day?
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.140]   - Yeah, whatever's happening.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.380]   Not like generic prompts that I'm gonna, you know,
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.140]   hey everybody, write down these five questions
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.180]   to ask yourself every day.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.020]   No, it's not like that.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.300]   It's just based on whatever your situation is in the moment.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.660]   Generally, I think use it to clarify your thinking
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.100]   and to think of other options.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.540]   Like you said, like if you think you have no choice,
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.380]   you're always wrong.
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.700]   There's always another choice.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.460]   If you think you've only got two choices,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.740]   well, those aren't options, that's a dilemma.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.700]   If you think you only have two choices,
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.460]   you still haven't thought enough.
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.460]   You have to keep thinking of other options.
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.900]   You can always add some crazy ones in there.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.940]   Like, okay, option number three,
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.020]   I quit everything and join a monastery.
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.380]   Okay, option number four,
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.780]   I go down to my local park and I lay on the bench
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.380]   and I don't leave, I become homeless.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.060]   Okay, well now you've added two more options
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.900]   that you don't like.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:42.100]   Okay, you can always keep going
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.420]   and then get more creative.
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.660]   Do the brainstorming approach
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.660]   where you're deliberately thinking of out-of-the-box,
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.300]   crazy solutions for your situation,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.060]   but just keep going until you've got like 10 or 20 options.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.500]   And many of my best ideas in life,
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.380]   the ones that I've been the happiest with,
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.540]   the choices I've made,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.420]   have come from this pushing myself
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.540]   to further solutions, right?
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.340]   It was actually like solution number 18
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.620]   that got me the most excited
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.540]   and that's the one I pursued.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.820]   - Is there an example of,
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.140]   I thought I was gonna do this
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.980]   and this new thing came out
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   that I never was thinking about originally?
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.820]   - Ooh, yeah, what's an example?
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.900]   Well, like actually that trip to India that I just took,
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.660]   that came far down the list.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.660]   At first it was like,
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.020]   I think I need to go to the TED conference again,
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.540]   which I haven't been to in 10 years.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.020]   And it was like, well,
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.340]   I think I just need to go to any conference.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.020]   And then it was like,
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.900]   what about a local class here in Wellington, New Zealand,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.740]   where I live?
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.700]   Maybe I can find like a philosophy course here
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.060]   so I can meet other interesting people
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.660]   that are into this kind of stuff I'm into.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.700]   And then it was like, oh, I could go traveling.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.100]   I could go travel Europe.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.380]   And I just kept going.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.140]   And then yeah, way down the list was like,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.140]   I could go to India.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.340]   That was like, oh, India, yes.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.100]   Oh my God, I haven't been to India in 12 years.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.060]   I know so many people in India.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.500]   And through a weird thing
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.260]   that I married a woman from India,
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.340]   I'm a citizen of India.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.620]   I have the legal right to live in India
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.700]   for the rest of my life.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.540]   I was like, ooh,
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.380]   see this one works for me on many levels
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.940]   because this wouldn't just be a travel.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.860]   This wouldn't just be a trip.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.620]   This is like an investment into my future.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.380]   Like it's likely I will live there someday.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.700]   And so getting to know it better now,
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   meeting people now would be an investment
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.220]   into future long-term friendships,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.140]   not just a quick romp at a conference.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.180]   So yeah, that came way down the list.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.140]   And that's one example.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.700]   And again, I just got back from this trip.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.860]   So it's on my mind right now,
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.580]   but I met so many interesting people there
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.420]   and had so many fascinating conversations.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.140]   It was just what I needed.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.500]   And yeah, that solution did not come
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.460]   until I had really spent an hour in my journal
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.340]   thinking of different solutions.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.180]   - I love it.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.340]   I'm gonna propose for people
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.380]   who might be like me thinking, gosh, journaling.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.260]   I wanna try, but I'm not sure what.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.060]   What I hear is take some decision
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.500]   you're thinking about making
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.820]   and maybe just spend an hour by yourself
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.780]   with a notebook, a pen, not a computer,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.340]   and just kind of think of different ways
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.380]   that you could have a different outcome.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.260]   Instead of journaling, I'm gonna call it brainstorming
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.260]   'cause I think we might be more familiar
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.180]   with how to start doing that.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.020]   But at the end of the day,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.860]   it's just writing things down and thinking about them.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.700]   So you can call it whatever you want.
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.860]   But I like this idea.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.620]   I'm not a disciplined journaling person,
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.260]   but I feel like I'm gonna try to take your advice after this
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.180]   and at least commit to it.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.740]   - I'm not disciplined either about it.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.940]   It is absolutely not a discipline.
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.100]   To me, it's just sanity.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.180]   It's like, I've been doing this since I was a teenager
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.660]   and I'm 53 now.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.180]   So almost every day I hit some point
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.100]   where I need to clarify my thoughts on something.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.220]   What might even be about somebody,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.540]   like somebody's pissed you off
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.860]   and you find that you're all upset.
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.580]   You need to kind of stop and clarify your thoughts
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.620]   instead of just sitting there and feeling angry.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.460]   And like, wait, why am I feeling angry?
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.460]   What's this really about?
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.980]   And so instead of just sitting there on your sofa stewing,
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.380]   it's just like, open your thing, whatever it is,
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.580]   your paper notebook, or in my case,
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.420]   I just use a plain text file.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.900]   I just open up a plain text file and I just start typing.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.340]   There's no discipline to it at all.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.260]   It's just like, what the hell?
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.460]   I am so angry right now.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.940]   Why am I angry?
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.500]   Because this person did that thing.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   Well, so what?
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.180]   Why does that matter?
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.260]   Well, because this.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.340]   And I'll just kind of have this dialogue with myself,
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.500]   like I said, and like kind of challenging and pushing back.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.180]   I hear that, I don't know much about this,
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.380]   but I've heard that this is similar
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.740]   to something called cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.060]   And it is known to be one of the few things
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.860]   that works for people with depression or anxiety
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.380]   or other major life problems.
[00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.660]   Cognitive behavioral therapy works wonders.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.620]   I heard that a couple of times.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.980]   And when I just looked into what it is,
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.180]   it sounds like it's what I've been doing in my journal
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.220]   since I was a teenager.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.220]   So I could say it in my very undisciplined way
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.060]   that it's worked wonders for me.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.180]   And most of the major life decisions that I've made
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.460]   have come from that process.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.740]   - It sounds a little bit also like rubber duck debugging.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.780]   I don't know if you're familiar as a way to make decisions.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.300]   I think you wrote a post about getting mentors advice
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.140]   without actually ever speaking with them.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.980]   I don't know about you,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.820]   but I'm using the new year as an excuse
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.940]   to get fitness back in my routine.
[00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.100]   And if you're gonna work out,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.460]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.980]   which I think is Viori,
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.900]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.300]   Viori makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.300]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.700]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.380]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.260]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.220]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.220]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.660]   unless it's Viori, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.140]   And it's not just for men.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.700]   My wife, Amy, is just as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.620]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.620]   I have a few pairs,
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.460]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.780]   I've ever owned.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.900]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.940]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.300]   and they could be used for just about any activity,
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.580]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.080]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.940]   or their Meta Pants can even work for a night out.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.980]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness,
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.300]   and for All The Hacks listeners,

[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.100]   You wanna give them everything they need to grow and thrive,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.780]   both now and in the future,
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.780]   which is why I'm excited to partner with Fabric
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.740]   by Gerber Life for this episode.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.580]   With term life insurance from Fabric,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.420]   you can help protect your family
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   so their future is secure no matter what happens.

[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.820]   I actually went online to compare prices,

[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.360]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.060]   not available in certain states,
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.580]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.660]   - Should we tell the listeners quickly,
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.140]   so the rubber ducking comes from,
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.460]   first it's from back in the day
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.980]   when people had those big monitors,
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.020]   the big CRT monitors on their desktop computers.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.340]   - That you could actually put something on top.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.820]   - Yeah, where you could put things on top.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.980]   And so computer programmers started a habit
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.740]   of putting a little rubber duck on top of their monitor.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.500]   And whenever they were trying to get work
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.460]   through a programming problem where they're stuck,
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.340]   there's like, okay, tell the duck.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.500]   And so you'd say to the duck,
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.420]   like the reason I'm stuck is because I can't figure this.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.180]   Well, then why can't you figure out that?
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.660]   Because what I'm trying to get is the instances table
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.060]   to match with the something table.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:49.300]   Well, why can't you do that?
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.900]   Because it's, and so yeah, explain it to the rubber duck
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.860]   and it'll help you clarify your thoughts.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.260]   Yeah, so that's definitely what I'm doing
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.620]   in my journal, then changing the subject.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.580]   You said the mentors that, yeah, I often,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.500]   when journaling, I'll ask myself,
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.940]   like, what would Seth Godin say?
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.340]   Like he's a hero of mine and he's such a wise guy
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.460]   beyond his marketing that he talks about.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.660]   He's just wise in general.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.300]   Like his approach to life is very thoughtful and measured.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.380]   And he's a friend that I could call,
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.060]   but before calling him, I ask myself,
[00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.900]   if I were to call Seth right now,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.580]   what would he probably say?
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.940]   Like, I know what he would say.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:28.780]   He would say this.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.620]   And I'd like write that.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.700]   And then that ends up helping me get to a good solution
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.740]   for myself without ever having to bother Seth Godin.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.300]   So yeah, I wrote a post about that.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.340]   Like how to ask your mentors for help
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.180]   or something like that.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.620]   And I just basically described this process,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.020]   like ask yourself what the mentors would say.
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:46.860]   - I love it.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.300]   I'll try to find all the links to everything we talk about,
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.300]   put it in the show notes so people can find it.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.660]   I met someone once and I offered
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.500]   to help them with a challenge.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.620]   And they said, no, no, no, I don't want your help yet.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.460]   I have a rule.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.420]   I try to spend 15 minutes at least on my own,
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.620]   trying to solve something before I ask for anyone
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.100]   to spend their time to help me out.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.500]   And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.500]   To use one of your phrases,
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.940]   this person is making it easy for me to say no on my own.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.460]   And so it's something I've tried to do in my own life
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   is I feel like plenty of us are overwhelmed.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.740]   We have lots of stuff going on
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.260]   and we could talk in a bit about how to slow down
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.940]   and say no and only focus on the things you care about.
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.220]   But one way that I can kind of contribute to the problem
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.420]   or relieving the problem is just trying not to ask everyone
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.340]   to help me out until I've tried to do some work on my own.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.660]   And my snarky reply to close friends
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.020]   and family members for years was always the,
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.620]   let me Google that for you site if you've ever been there,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.020]   which was someone texts you and they're like,
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.460]   do you know a good Italian restaurant in Dallas?
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   And I'm like, yeah, Italian restaurant.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.580]   Like you could just search for these things.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.780]   I've never even been to Dallas.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.900]   Now I'm hoping that the world will slowly adopt a practice
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.020]   of trying to do a little bit of homework
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.500]   before asking people.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.900]   'Cause it's easy for me to text back my sister or my mom.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.220]   Hey, why don't you do a Google search before asking?
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.980]   It's much harder to text a stranger
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.820]   or a business acquaintance back and be like,
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.740]   hey, could you actually just try before emailing me?
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.940]   But there were a couple of things we talked about
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.060]   that I wanna loop back to.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.740]   So it's gonna be a bit of a zigzag conversation.
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.500]   Journaling allows you to come up with lots of options.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.020]   You know, you talked about decision-making.
[00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.100]   If there's one option, it's not true.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.340]   If there's two, it's a dilemma,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.500]   but you wanna get to a place where there's a lot.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.940]   One of the challenges I have,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.540]   and I think a lot of people listening have,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.340]   is actually on the other direction,
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.180]   which is getting into this analysis paralysis.
[00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.620]   So a few weeks ago, I did an episode about insurance
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.820]   and I went down this crazy rabbit hole
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.500]   of how do I get the best homeowners
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.180]   and auto and umbrella policies for my life,
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.980]   which led to, oh, there's all these carriers.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.660]   I should go get a quote from all of them
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.260]   and I should analyze all these details.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.100]   And believe me, I did not have a dilemma or A or B.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.340]   It was like, there weren't enough letters in the alphabet
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.620]   to define the option set I had.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.500]   And then you're like, oh, well, if I go with this one,
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.620]   it's a little bit more expensive.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.500]   But if our SUV breaks down,
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.020]   they guarantee that I could rent an SUV
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.420]   instead of just an economy car.
[00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.380]   But this other one offers this other feature.
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.700]   And for me, it was a struggle.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.460]   I searched to see if you'd written about this
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.300]   because I was like, ah,
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.700]   I know someone who might have some advice.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.740]   Then I tried to think about what would Derek say
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.860]   and I couldn't really come up with it.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.580]   So I'll just ask you,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.540]   how would you suggest people think about making decisions
[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.420]   when there are too many options and they're struggling?
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.260]   - Oof.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:32.260]   For me, one option usually leaps out
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.220]   as the one that makes me feel the best.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.660]   And it's not always rational and that's okay.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.820]   And then if it doesn't,
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.100]   I just pick one that seems to rationally work.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.140]   And then it's a mindset that picking anything
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.380]   is better than picking nothing.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.340]   If it's something that you have to pick.
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.940]   Okay, so wait, what do I mean by that?
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.620]   There's a great value in launching, for example.
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.460]   I've met some people
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.300]   that have been working on their book for so long
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.340]   without launching it, without calling it complete,
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.780]   that they're reaping none of the benefits
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.380]   of having the book out there in the public, right?
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.540]   So at some point with anything you're creating,
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.260]   whether it's a blog post or a decision,
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:17.100]   you realize, all right,
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.180]   well, I just have to finish this thing.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.380]   I have to finish this choice.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.940]   I have to finish this article that I'm working on.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.940]   And once you put great value onto finishing or deciding,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.500]   then what you do is you just get into a different mindset
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.940]   about the benefit of putting it out there,
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.140]   the benefit of finishing.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.420]   Like say, you can make any choice great
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.540]   through just deciding to make the best of it.
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.140]   Okay, but wait, sorry, that answer was a little mushy.
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.740]   - Related to this insurance thing,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.100]   I'm looking back and I'm thinking there were two moments
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.560]   where I could have done what you suggested
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.840]   that would have made it a lot faster.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.220]   And I probably would have felt a lot better.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.800]   One was for some reason, and I can't really explain why,
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.260]   maybe it's the positive reviews,
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.620]   maybe it's the word of mouth, the consumer reports rating,
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.740]   just felt like USAA as an insurance carrier
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.860]   was where I kind of just wanted to end up.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.940]   Every time I was about to hit the recalculate button,
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.840]   I was like, come on, just be really competitive
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.860]   so I can just be done with this.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.620]   So one answer was, if you have that feeling,
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.700]   just own it and be like,
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.200]   yeah, it might be a little more expensive,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.140]   let's move forward.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.380]   That was one.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.360]   The alternative version, let's say you don't have that,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.820]   is, well, right now the problem
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.660]   was that we were using one carrier
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.840]   and they just couldn't continue to insure the house
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.340]   because the house had kind of appreciated
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.460]   and it wasn't a good fit.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.780]   So we needed to move carriers.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.460]   Instead of making it about the big decision
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.540]   of we have to have a new insurance carrier,
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.300]   so this is not a do I need this or not,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.940]   we absolutely need this.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.640]   But instead of trying to find the best possible thing,
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.940]   I could have picked the first carrier
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.740]   that could do what we needed
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.600]   and put that policy into place,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.380]   be done with the policy that I have now
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.980]   that I know is not good,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.420]   and then decided, okay,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.020]   is it worth continuing to evaluate the landscape?
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.940]   Because what I was doing was I actually had two problems.
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.180]   I had, I have something that doesn't work
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.780]   and I need something that works
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.900]   and I'm also interested in finding the best thing.
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.660]   And because I was solving them both at the same time,
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.380]   I was actually delaying getting the thing in place
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.700]   that I needed to do more urgently.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.280]   And if I had just picked anything,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.940]   it might have been more expensive,
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.200]   but I would have been done with problem A
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.580]   and I probably could have said,
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.140]   is it really worth trying to solve problem B right now?
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.520]   But when I put the two problems together,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.900]   I made it seem like they were equally as important.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.440]   So if you could just pick anything that is good
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.260]   and then decide whether you wanna go on the quest for great
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.660]   or go on to another quest for good in your life.
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.620]   I don't know.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.940]   That's me trying to philosophize your feedback,
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.320]   but I could have completely butchered it.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.500]   - No, you nailed it.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.460]   That was wonderful.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.940]   All right, Chris, I've got three topics
[00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.540]   you just brought up.
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:00.380]   - Okay.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.620]   - I'm gonna name them first
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.620]   so we can remember to come back to them.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.180]   Number one, the coin toss.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.120]   Number two, the paradox of choice.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.280]   Number three, theory versus practice.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.920]   Okay, coin toss.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.320]   The reason to flip a coin when you're making a decision
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.920]   is not to let the heads or the tails actually decide it.
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.000]   It's to notice how you feel when the coin is in the air.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.880]   Like you just said about USAA.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.520]   If you were to do the coin toss with USAA,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.760]   you would have been like, oh, please land on USAA.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.700]   And as soon as you notice that feeling in yourself,
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.820]   it's like, okay, I think I've just decided.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.140]   It isn't actually the coin that decides.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.380]   It's the pressure of that like, oh God, here it comes.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.980]   Here's the final decision.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.340]   And then you notice which one
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.340]   you're actually leaning towards.
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.860]   Okay, that is to be valued because emotions matter.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.620]   I've sometimes chosen, say like,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.180]   the more expensive internet service provider
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.740]   because I think they're more ethical or they're cooler
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.060]   and I just feel better about giving my money
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.900]   to that company even though it's more expensive
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.100]   than the other choice.
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.860]   Okay, so that's the coin toss.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.420]   - I'm like thinking with the coin toss,
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.100]   I'm like, I want to create this rule around it
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.560]   where I have to commit to the decision
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.860]   of whatever lands on the coin toss
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.140]   unless I stop at midair and decide.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.620]   So it's like, you know, I could flip the coin
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.940]   and if my gut says what it is,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.900]   I can grab it out of midair and say, done.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.920]   I don't have to abide by the rule, I've decided.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.380]   - I wonder if it loses its value
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.100]   if you don't commit to it being a decider.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.420]   I just say, let's flip a coin and see how my gut feels.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.780]   I feel like the first few times, maybe it'll work.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.620]   By the end, I'm like,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.340]   well, now I just know I'm just flipping a coin.
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.300]   I'm trying to think of ways
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.740]   to make the coin toss higher stakes
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:51.220]   so it forces that kind of deep-rooted gut instinct
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.100]   out faster.
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.220]   - Well, it's a fun idea.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.060]   I disagree.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.660]   I think you should always go ultimately
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.580]   with the one that makes you feel the best.
[00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.400]   - Okay.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.340]   - Your thoughts matter, your feelings matter.
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.620]   You need to feel good about the choices you've made in life.
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.840]   You can't find yourself working at a job
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.620]   and every day for eight hours a day
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.900]   going somewhere where you're like,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.860]   ugh, yeah, it's the right choice.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.700]   (laughs)
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:18.020]   You know, the coin said, here I am, damn it.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.740]   So you've got to feel good about your choices.
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.700]   You can add rational reasons later,
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.340]   but the feelings are harder to adapt.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.420]   Sometimes it's the reverse.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.300]   Sometimes you make a choice because it's the right thing.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.000]   Okay, so "Paradox of Choice."
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.120]   There's a wonderful book about this thing.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.520]   You said that you were looking to my site
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.240]   to see if I'd written about this.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.240]   You need to look to the book called
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   "Paradox of Choice" by Barry Schwartz, S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:48.160]   Brilliant masterpiece of a book about exactly this,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.040]   about having too many options and what do you do.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.360]   And the gist, if you had to narrow the book down
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.360]   to a few sentences, is that when we consider every option,
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.160]   we may technically make a better choice,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.440]   but we will feel worse about it
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.040]   because we're too aware of all of the other choices
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.720]   we could have made.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.460]   So the advice, and let me pause to say,
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.720]   the advice which is coming from a PhD psychologist
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.520]   who has been studying the science of decision-making
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.660]   for many, many, many years, the advice,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.240]   after all of his studies and research into the subject,
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.000]   is that we should choose to satisfice, not maximize.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.760]   He said people, when they're making decisions,
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.000]   are either satisficing or maximizing.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.820]   So maximizing is what you were just doing
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.640]   with the insurance where you dive deep down the rabbit hole
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.400]   and you look deeply into every option
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.520]   and you really kind of kill yourself over it
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   and you maximize to make the best possible decision.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.380]   Satisficing is, in short, it's saying good enough.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.860]   It's like, I need a new insurance policy.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.600]   I'm gonna give myself one hour to pick a new one.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.440]   You look at some options.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.280]   You're like, okay, I'm picking this, good enough.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.800]   So what he said is that people who satisfice
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.500]   feel much better about the decision they make,
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.000]   psychologically, the way our brains work.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.340]   We feel better when we just make a decision,
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.400]   stick with it, and don't try
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.040]   to make the best possible decision.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.880]   - What about people who love,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.540]   like get intense joy out of that process?
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.200]   'Cause I think that's the crazy thing
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.680]   is when I was going through this,
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.560]   my wife was like, you have a lot of stuff to do.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.880]   Why are you still researching insurance?
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.720]   And I was like, I don't know.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   I built a new table.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.740]   I built a new comparison matrix and I was loving it.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.760]   And what was going through my head
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.060]   wasn't the $500 a year I'd save.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.120]   And I don't even know if it was the joy
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.600]   of knowing I made the best outcome.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.720]   You know, you mentioned earlier,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.240]   following your kind of intellectual curiosity.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.960]   And I was just generally very excited
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.200]   to understand the nuance of this whole space.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.760]   I get a lot of joy knowing that someone could
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.160]   ask me about it, I could give them a recommendation.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.240]   And I'm very jealous when someone says,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.800]   hey, I'm thinking about this thing.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.240]   And I'm like, oh, I did all this research.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.080]   This is what I said.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.900]   They're like, great, I'll do that.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.160]   I'm like, that's all you need.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.280]   You just needed me to talk for one sentence
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.040]   and now you're done and you made a decision.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.760]   And I'm very jealous of those people, but I do enjoy it.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.520]   It's not totally wasted time if you enjoy the process, fair?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.960]   - Right.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.040]   Yeah, see, it's funny.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.520]   You're talking about something different
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.440]   that I think was not included in that book,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   which is the benefit of kind of you taking one for the team.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.400]   Like you doing the hard work so that others don't have to
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.240]   and getting like a deeper kind of community
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   joy from how much you're sharing.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.840]   Like, yeah, it's wonderful that people like you
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.960]   do all the hard work like that every now and then
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.400]   and dive down those rabbit holes.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.440]   So people like the rest of us can just say,
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.320]   I need new, well, Chris already figured it out.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.540]   So hold on, let me just see.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.960]   All right, Chris chose this.
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.040]   All right, I'm just choosing that.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.600]   There, problem done.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.640]   It's like, because you maximized, we can satisfy.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.480]   You know, we can say, all right, I'll let him choose.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.680]   I do that so many times in life with say,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.440]   what'd you say, the best Italian restaurant in Dallas
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.320]   that I'll just look, okay, what did somebody else say?
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:23.600]   Oh, look, somebody's done an article
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.080]   about the seven best Italian restaurants in Dallas.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:26.920]   Which do they choose?
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.480]   All right, I'm just gonna go to that one then.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.320]   Problem solved.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.040]   When I moved to Los Angeles years ago,
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.840]   I'd never really been to Los Angeles,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.000]   but my girlfriend at the time
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.640]   had just signed up for film school down there.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.720]   I was like, I'm gonna go with her.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.080]   So I emailed 10 people I knew that lived in LA
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.000]   and I said, hey, what neighborhood should I live in?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.160]   And everybody had different answers,
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.880]   but Santa Monica was on nine out of the 10 people's lists.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.640]   It's, oh, you know, Palisades, whatever,
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.120]   Pasadena, Santa Monica, somebody else would say Venice,
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.580]   Santa Monica, Century City,
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.200]   but Santa Monica was on everybody's list.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.100]   So I didn't even look at any other options.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.920]   I just went straight to Santa Monica,
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.120]   went to the real estate office there
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.060]   and just said, what do you got?
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.240]   And I didn't look anywhere else
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.000]   because I deferred to my friend's choices.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.920]   So yeah, other people did the hard work
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.640]   of living there for years and discovering every neighborhood
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.120]   and learning the hard way.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.680]   I just took the benefit of their work.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.720]   So yes, you diving down your rabbit hole
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.200]   and benefiting the rest of the world by doing so is great.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.800]   And I love just using other people's work for that.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.280]   But also you were having fun.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.520]   You say that you were sweating it,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.000]   but part of you was just enjoying it.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.640]   You're like, this is fascinating.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.400]   Oh my God, look at all these different options.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.040]   I'm gonna make a grid.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.900]   You know, this is giving me some kind of joy
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.480]   to lay out all my options in a spreadsheet
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.960]   and find out about this and wow, this is fascinating.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.440]   You know, like this one won't give you an SUV replacement.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.760]   They'll just give you a car.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.780]   This one won't do this.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.760]   Wow, there are so many parameters here
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.440]   I hadn't noticed before.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.320]   So computer programmers do this a lot, of course,
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.600]   when you're looking for a tech solution to something
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.880]   and you look out to the world of open source software
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.120]   and you're like, okay, oh my God,
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.360]   there are like nine different calendar apps
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.400]   that I could use.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.880]   Okay, let me dive into the pros and cons of each one.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.240]   And then you might find this less popular one
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.480]   that serves your needs exactly.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.640]   But boy, it was kind of interesting
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.040]   to learn about all the different features
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.600]   that you hadn't even considered in these.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.520]   And we might just enjoy that process.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   And somebody might say it's a stupid use of your time,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.640]   but if you're finding it fascinating,
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:32.600]   well then you're kind of like choosing this
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.800]   over watching a movie, right?
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.000]   Like other people would just sit there
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.680]   and stare at a TV screen.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.240]   You're engaging with the world
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.320]   and getting entertainment out of doing this.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.040]   And lastly, my example that I got made fun of a lot for
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.360]   was when I was running my company CD Baby for 10 years,
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:55.040]   I was the 100% owner, I was the CEO,
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.640]   and yet whenever we needed a new computer for the office,
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.000]   which happened about 50 times,
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.300]   I had 85 employees and we had about 50 computers
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.620]   in the office, I would build the computer myself.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:09.020]   I would go down to the electronics store,
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.540]   get the motherboard, pick out the CPU,
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.860]   the graphics card, the hard drive,
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.580]   the case, the power supply.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.220]   And I would thoroughly enjoy being in the office at night
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:21.900]   after everybody had left,
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.900]   building a computer while listening to music.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.220]   And once it was all put together,
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.980]   I would install Linux onto it and get it working.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:31.500]   And then the morning I'd set it up at somebody's desk
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.460]   and be like, ah, that was fun.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:38.300]   And somebody teased me years later saying sarcastically,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.140]   like, yeah, that was a good use of the CEO's time.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.100]   And I said, it fucking was.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:48.020]   It was a great use of my time because I loved doing it.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.220]   Like, I wouldn't wanna outsource that joy to somebody else.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.840]   Like, I really loved those evenings at the office
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.940]   putting a computer together.
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.780]   I find it very peaceful.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.980]   Some people do crossword puzzles for that same joy, right?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:01.660]   You don't outsource the crossword puzzle
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.460]   to have somebody else solve it for you.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.660]   You do it yourself 'cause you enjoy it.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.500]   - I think it's a message
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   that we probably haven't shared enough in this show
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.380]   is that if you really enjoy that process,
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.420]   sometimes it's stressful.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.500]   I've had moments where I'm like an hour
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.580]   into comparing the distribution of one to five ratings
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.460]   on Korean restaurants in LA,
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.820]   and I should have stopped and flipped a coin.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.740]   It wouldn't have mattered.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.260]   And sometimes I think it's too much,
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   but there are times where it's really enjoyable.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.060]   And even when it's a lot, it can be fun.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.020]   And I like the fact that you've been able
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.460]   to prioritize pursuing things that make you happy
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.800]   and that you enjoy and stimulate you intellectually.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.440]   And I think we probably don't do that enough
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.140]   as an average person in society.
[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.980]   - Hey, wait, Chris.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.980]   So remember when I like named those three things,
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.340]   the coin toss, the paradox of choice,
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.180]   there was a third one.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.020]   - Theory versus practice.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:49.340]   - Yes, we haven't done that yet.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.340]   So many times I've found myself in my journal
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.580]   thinking maybe this, maybe that.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.260]   And you realize there's so many things in life
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:05.580]   that in theory sound good,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.600]   but in practice are not or vice versa.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.420]   And so I've learned the hard way
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:12.320]   that you have to just try these things.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.220]   You have to just go do it.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.820]   And it even comes with choices like yours about insurance.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.940]   I'm really glad that you gave that example of like,
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.500]   maybe I'll just pick one now just to get out of my situation
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.540]   and then if I don't like it, I'll change again.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.100]   That to me is a beautiful little example
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.140]   of trying something in practice instead of just in theory.
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.140]   So there have been a major life decisions I've made,
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   like moving here to New Zealand.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.060]   That came from the similar kind of dilemma.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:45.740]   I was sitting in Singapore with my ex who said,
[00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.860]   I hate it here.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.340]   And I was like, okay, so where else can we go?
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.300]   New Zealand seems nice.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.400]   We've never actually lived there,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.140]   but it seems like a nice place to be like, let's try it.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.340]   Like we'll never know what New Zealand is like
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.740]   unless we just try it.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.860]   And it took a few months of paperwork to become a resident
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:04.840]   in order to stay long enough to really try living here.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.900]   But you have to do these things in practice,
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.460]   not just in theory, just to see what it's really like
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.700]   with the understanding that I'm still just trying it.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.260]   This isn't like a final decision.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.800]   This is still just, I'm going to try this option,
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   but I need to try it in practice, not just in theory.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.400]   - Has that changed?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.740]   You talk about moving and living different places.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.400]   You have a family or you have a child.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.860]   How does that affect your ability
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.160]   to live this kind of nomadic lifestyle
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   or put these theories into practice or has it not?
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.040]   - It has.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.060]   We let the tangent go earlier,
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.800]   but you said something about the fact that I went to India
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.640]   for only 10 days instead of deciding to move there.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.480]   Dude, if my kid wasn't in school in New Zealand right now,
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.800]   and if his mother didn't work for the New Zealand government
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.640]   and needs to be here, I would be living in India right now.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.140]   I loved that trip so much.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.980]   I just wanted to cancel my return flight home.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.500]   I met so many wonderful people there.
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.780]   It was one of those moments in my life.
[00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:05.580]   And I've had a few of these where you go somewhere
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.200]   and it just like, everything in you is just a yes.
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.700]   You're like, oh my God, yes, this is where I need to be.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.340]   And so a few times in my life, I've done this,
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.540]   where I just was visiting somewhere
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.700]   and I just canceled my return flight and stayed.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.940]   I was living in Santa Monica, California,
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.200]   when I went to New York City for a friend's wedding.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.140]   And it was a three-day trip.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.940]   And I went there with just basically three days of clothes,
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.680]   attended the wedding.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.700]   But just something about like getting out of the train
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.140]   in Penn Station and walking out into Manhattan,
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.840]   it was like (growls) the energy of the place.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.500]   I was just like, oh, hell yeah,
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.340]   this is what I need right now.
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:41.700]   I was like, I could fly back to Santa Monica
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.640]   to get my clothes,
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.540]   but that would put a lot of pollution into the air.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.940]   And I think my clothes aren't even worth that much.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.840]   So I just canceled my return flight
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.200]   and bought some new clothes and stayed.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.640]   And I lived in New York for a year.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.600]   And so, yeah, I just had that moment last week in India
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.740]   of just like, damn, I just wanna stay here.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.240]   This is where I need to be now.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.340]   But yeah, I've got a kid who's 11 and in school now
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.000]   and his mom works for the government and here we are.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.900]   So instead, I'm just going to use that restriction
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.400]   in my life, that creative restriction to work within that.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.060]   So I'll just go visit more often.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.500]   - There's been so much talk lately about AI
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.900]   and I love playing around with chat GPT,
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.240]   but the AI tool I actually use most is Notion AI.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.800]   And I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.940]   for this episode.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.340]   As I've said many times,
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.700]   I literally use Notion every day for notes, trip planning,
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.840]   managing our family,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.260]   and most importantly, running this podcast.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.800]   It's definitely one of my all time favorite tools
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.160]   and it only got better with Notion AI,
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.340]   which can help you automate tedious tasks
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.000]   and streamline your workflow.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.860]   For example, you can save time and write faster
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.100]   by letting Notion AI handle the brainstorm and first draft
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.460]   or turn messy notes into something really polished.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.160]   I've been using it for the past few months
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.500]   and it's blown my mind on multiple occasions.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.340]   In fact, when I was trying to explain homeowner's insurance,
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:00.760]   I just asked Notion AI to quote,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.240]   "Write a paragraph overview
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.240]   "of what homeowner's insurance is for," and boom.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.160]   I can tell you firsthand that Notion AI
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.800]   helps you work faster, write better, think bigger,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.460]   and do tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.300]   And the best part?

[00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.160]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.420]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:46.980]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.140]   and my info as possible.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.980]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.140]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.140]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.400]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.360]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.560]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.900]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.400]   it only took a few minutes
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.460]   because I used Delete.me from Abine,
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.260]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.500]   with them for this episode.
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.280]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.060]   that will not just find and remove
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.580]   your personal information
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.360]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.740]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.120]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.060]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.420]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.940]   in their first two years,
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.400]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.740]   of data for their customers.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.820]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.300]   removed from all these listings on the internet,
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.300]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.860]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.840]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.580]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,
[00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.880]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.180]   and discounts from our partners,

[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.520]   So I wanna come back to parenting at some point.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.440]   A lot of these tangents,
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.060]   you said something earlier about heroes,
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.300]   and I know you have some perspective
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.980]   on how thinking about heroes can be valuable
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.420]   to thinking about what you wanna do.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:24.980]   Maybe we could touch on that a little
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.680]   because I think it kind of ties together.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.520]   Who are we?
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.540]   What do we care about?
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.960]   What do we wanna do with our lives and our careers?
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.800]   How do you think about that?
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.160]   You're in a place where you've both had success.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.300]   It's given you a lot of creative flexibility
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.220]   with work and life and where you live.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.680]   Maybe not everyone has that.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.380]   Maybe people need to work towards that.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.060]   But you've been fortunate to find the thing you love doing.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.940]   And I don't think it was the thing you always thought.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.780]   You've said that you feel
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.980]   like you most associate with a writer now,
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.260]   but I don't think it started like that.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.020]   You didn't know that for many years.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.180]   How did you come to that,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.880]   and how might you have come to that sooner
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.140]   with the wisdom you have now?
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.020]   - Well, it's funny.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.260]   People sometimes say, "Oh, well, dude, you're lucky.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.440]   "You can just get up and go."
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.800]   I'm like, "But that's not luck.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.620]   "That was, the life I'm living is the culmination
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.340]   "of like 180 little decisions along the way
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.800]   "since I was a teenager."
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.040]   Like at every little point,
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:20.640]   starting from when I was like 17 years old,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.220]   I over and over again made the choice
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.520]   that gave me more freedom
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.780]   because I knew this was important to me.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.040]   So even if I was, say, like offered a job
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.420]   that was going to pay more but give me less freedom,
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.260]   I said no.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.180]   I chose the choice with more freedom
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:37.780]   even though it paid less money.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.920]   I chose the romantic partner
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.740]   that also wanted to travel the world
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.340]   instead of getting romantically tangled
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.780]   with somebody who is bound to living next door
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.620]   to her parents.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.700]   Even when I set up my company,
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.400]   the way that I set up like the organization
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:52.840]   and how it was run,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.700]   I chose the choice that would give me more freedom.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.060]   And God, so many things.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.000]   Even like when I decided to sell my company,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.800]   my number one criteria was like,
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.160]   "This is going to be a cash sale.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.900]   You're going to pay me for this and then I'm gone.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.140]   I'm not going to consult with you.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.300]   I'm not going to stay around
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.500]   because I want the freedom."
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:09.660]   Everything along the way,
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.380]   every choice I made was to get me to this point.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:14.480]   And so when somebody goes like,
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.660]   "Oh, you're just lucky."
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.500]   (laughs)
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.760]   I'm like, no, this is very deliberate.
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.980]   In fact, let's rewind even further.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.140]   A friend gave me a really good example of this
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.440]   when he said he doesn't believe in luck.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.040]   And I said,
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.720]   "Yeah, says the guy that was lucky to be born
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.320]   in a first world country,
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.560]   'cause he was born in America."
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.120]   I said, "Yeah, easy for the American
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.680]   to say he doesn't believe in luck, right?
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.840]   Tell that to somebody in South Sudan."
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.720]   And he's just like, "Dude," he said,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.800]   "I was born in America
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.280]   because my grandparents left everything they know in Poland
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.600]   and got on a ship for four months
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.260]   and sailed all the way to this country
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.060]   where they didn't speak the language.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.200]   And it was incredibly hard,
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.480]   but they did it because they felt
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.680]   that would give their children a better future."
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.360]   And then even their children
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.800]   were like children of Polish immigrants
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.940]   that lived in a bad neighborhood,
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.920]   but worked really hard to save their money
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.160]   and spend nothing on pleasures
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.600]   so that they could save it for their kids.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:22.100]   And then, yes, I grew up in Chicago or whatever
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.040]   with a nice life, but it took two generations, he said.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.560]   So I think that's insulting to call that luck.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.680]   He said, "My nice life
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:35.680]   is the result of like 80 years of sacrifice."
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.480]   I was like, "Okay, all right, very good point."
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.000]   So I still believe in luck, like crazy.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.160]   I still think that most of my success was luck,
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:45.040]   but a lot of little decisions
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.880]   that you make on a day-to-day level
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.160]   can have huge impacts
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.000]   on the direction of the rest of your life.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.560]   - You knew freedom was something
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.460]   you wanted to optimize for over years.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.680]   I meet lots of people that maybe don't know that thing.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.540]   The job comes, it offers to pay them more,
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.280]   it doesn't have the flexibility to travel,
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.960]   they don't know what they want in life.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.040]   Is the answer to always optimize for freedom
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.820]   because it gives you more options in the future?
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.060]   Or is there a time where more financial resources
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.260]   can add more value?
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:17.320]   Or is there a framework you have
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.360]   for thinking about what do I want right now in my life?
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.240]   What do I look up to?
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.780]   Who do I wanna be?
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.840]   - Well, like we said at the very beginning,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.000]   sometimes you need to ask yourself,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.600]   what is my life lacking right now?
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:32.020]   And I need to steer that direction to get my balance back.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:37.020]   But more often it helps to look at the common thread
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.880]   in your life so far,
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.720]   like your life choices so far.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.680]   In reality, what has been something
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.600]   that through all the choices has made you the happiest?
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.920]   And maybe it's money.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.480]   Maybe it's choosing the option
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.280]   that binds you tighter to people.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.960]   Like maybe you're one of those lucky people
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.240]   that at the age of 19 found the love of your life.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.600]   And ever since then,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.880]   like your friends had crazy dating adventures,
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.580]   but you've been happy to be with one person
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.520]   since the age of 19.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.200]   And you know that like that's given you
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.680]   such a deep happiness in life
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.440]   that can't compare to all these little digital nomads
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.680]   bragging about their freedom.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.200]   And they're just like, yeah, but guess what?
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.460]   I've got something better than that.
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.740]   You need to just look back at your life
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.440]   to notice what continuously makes you the happiest
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.400]   and use that when making your future decisions as well.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.720]   For me, it was freedom,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.480]   but for somebody else, it might be money.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.720]   They might say, you know what?
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.600]   The kind of life I want, I really want a swimming pool
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.000]   and I really want a Ferrari.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.600]   I really want three houses.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.720]   It's like, all right, then for what you really want,
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.760]   especially if that's in practice, not just in theory,
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.640]   if you've actually rented a Ferrari for a week
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.880]   and you know that owning that Ferrari
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.360]   will make you so much happier.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:02.040]   If you know that in practice, not just in theory,
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.600]   then all right, you know,
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.160]   this is gonna help shape your decisions
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.760]   that you need to go for the option that pays more
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.080]   versus the freedom option.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.520]   You shouldn't be a digital nomad
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.320]   if a Ferrari is super important to you
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.440]   because it's harder to bring that Ferrari
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.100]   to Thailand and Columbia.
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.120]   Not everybody should choose what I've chosen.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.080]   That would be stupid.
[00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.280]   You should choose what you've noticed in practice
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.440]   makes you the happiest.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:30.300]   - For anyone who doesn't know Derek's full story,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.560]   you had the option when you sold your company
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.480]   to take all the money
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.600]   and live the life of Ferraris and swimming pools
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.640]   and wanted to kind of take that off the table
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   as a future path that you could even be tempted by
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.560]   and gave it all away.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.840]   So I thought that was kind of an ultimate hack in my mind
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.800]   of you didn't want the chance to ever be
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.560]   kind of turned towards a life
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.000]   that you weren't actually interested in,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:52.840]   you just gave it away.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.960]   I noticed from the past,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.780]   I knew that choice would make me happier.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:58.720]   It was really obvious
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.080]   when I was looking at all the different options
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.240]   of what to do when selling my company.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.160]   And when I looked at the option of giving the money away,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.740]   but in a way where I do continue to get a trickle
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.280]   paid out to me for the rest of my life,
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.680]   that option made me way happier because that made it
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.520]   so I couldn't get into this scenario
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.440]   where I had $20 million just sitting in the bank
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   to do something stupid with.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.720]   I didn't want that option.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.720]   I knew that option would make me unhappy
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.640]   because that's too much money.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.340]   But having half a million in the bank,
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.520]   that makes me happy, that gives me freedom,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   but that's not too much.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.160]   It's not stupid money, just very nice.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.320]   - And you mentioned to look back
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.600]   at who you've been and what you've done.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:38.880]   There's something that I took away from you
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.840]   that I think has been really valuable
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.640]   is not just looking at the thoughts
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.600]   and the opinions you've had, but what you've done.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.080]   Like looking at your actual actions.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.720]   You've said, I think, that your actions
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.440]   actually reveal your values.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.240]   Maybe we could talk on this just for a minute is,
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.060]   you know, it's interesting.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:55.900]   Some people I know say,
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:57.900]   "Oh, I'm the person that does this."
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:59.460]   But if you're not actually doing it,
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.720]   are you really that person?
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.200]   So...
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.380]   - Right.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:04.220]   You know, it's funny.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.400]   I had to read that post again.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.200]   I had almost forgotten about that one.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.560]   I'll tell the little tale quickly.
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:14.160]   The article is at sive.rs/arv,
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.720]   A-R-V meaning actions reveal values.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.560]   So I remember that short URL I gave it
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.120]   and I should revisit it now.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.960]   Almost forgotten.
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.100]   So the story is, I was talking to an old friend of mine
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.800]   and I had been putting off
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.320]   starting this company called Muckwork.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.760]   I had this idea, like literally the day
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.400]   after I sold Seedy Baby,
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.480]   I had this idea for my next company called Muckwork.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.900]   And I got four months into it
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.160]   and then I paused to go explore the world instead.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:45.740]   And here we are 10 years later.
[00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:46.580]   And I said to my friend,
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:48.120]   "Oh, I really want to do Muckwork.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.200]   I really want to make this happen."
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.040]   And my friend goes,
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.860]   "No, you don't."
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:55.400]   What do you mean, no, I don't?
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.240]   I'm telling you.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.060]   Yes, I do.
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:57.900]   And he goes, "No, you don't."
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.200]   I said, "Dude, you can't just tell me I don't.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.360]   I'm telling you, I really want to do this."
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.820]   And he said, "No, you don't.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.880]   You don't really want to do this.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.300]   If you really wanted to do this,
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.520]   you would have made it happen right now."
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.160]   He said, "You keep putting it off,
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.720]   which to me makes it clear
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.220]   that you don't really want this thing.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.600]   'Cause otherwise you would have just done it.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.420]   You wouldn't be saying I want to do it.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:20.960]   You would do it if you really wanted to do it."
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.480]   Went, "Oh, wow."
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.240]   And he said, "Yeah, your actions reveal your values."
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.840]   And that's been so, so useful to me.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.860]   Wow, actually, Chris, thanks for bringing this up
[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.540]   because that is kind of in theory versus in practice
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.260]   revealed, put into action, right?
[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.380]   It's don't think about what you want in theory.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.380]   Look at what you've chosen in the past
[00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.540]   or look at what your actions have revealed
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.220]   your values to be.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.220]   Ever since I read that post, I've just been reflecting it.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:48.900]   I've been sharing it with people.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.740]   Someone I talked to was like,
[00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:51.100]   "I really want to lose weight.
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.740]   I've wanted to lose weight for the last two years."
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:53.780]   And I'm like, "Do you know how?"
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.460]   And they're like, "Yeah, I know I need to exercise."
[00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.780]   And it's like, "Well, I don't think you really want to."
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:57:59.620]   Which is fine.
[00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:00.980]   I'm not trying to cast judgment.
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.140]   I'm just saying, you know how to do something.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.180]   You say you really want to do it and you haven't done it.
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.820]   Maybe you don't want to do it and that's okay.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.060]   And so it's made me reflect on my own life.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.660]   Oh, if I say I really want to do this,
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.740]   I should either do it or stop saying it.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.060]   Like there's no point in continuing to say
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.980]   you want to do something if you're not willing to do it.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.180]   And that simple phrase of your actions
[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:24.300]   revealing your values has made it easy for me
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.060]   to make one of two decisions.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.820]   Either, yes, let's do it or let's stop
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.100]   and let's not put it at the top of the priority list
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.620]   and just continue to push it down.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.020]   So that's been really helpful, thank you.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.180]   - Yeah, I'm just thinking about how you could use that
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:39.980]   to do tests of something you think you want.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.740]   See if you actually want it in practice.
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:43.460]   Like if somebody says, "I really want to lose weight."
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.740]   It's like, all right, well, let's spend at least one week
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:49.540]   where you eat nothing but protein twice a day
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:50.380]   and that's all you eat.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.020]   Let's make sure that's what you really want.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.660]   Or, "I really want a Ferrari."
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:57.900]   Okay, rent one for a week and see
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:00.260]   if it really makes you so much happier.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:02.020]   Or, "I want to be a minimalist."
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.980]   Like, all right, well, leave everything behind
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:08.300]   and go spend a year living in Lithuania with nothing.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:11.700]   And if you like it in practice, not just in theory,
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.820]   you got to try these things.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.100]   - Sometimes it reveals itself to be a lot easier.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:18.100]   Starting this podcast for me was one where I was like,
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.220]   I'd always wanted to do something.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:21.860]   I tried a blog, I tried a newsletter
[00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:24.660]   and I'd never really found the thing.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.020]   And once I put the podcast out there, I was like,
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.460]   oh, it's actually, it's not as hard as I had thought,
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.220]   but it wasn't until I realized that if I didn't do it,
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.940]   then I didn't really want to do it in the first place.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:38.020]   So why not just force yourself to try?
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.100]   And you're like, oh, it's actually,
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.260]   I'm more capable of doing this, it's easier.
[00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.820]   So for me, I think it's just that framework
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   has helped make it easier for me to do things
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.980]   that probably would have been harder
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:49.740]   before thinking with that perspective.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.220]   And there's two things we haven't hit on
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.500]   that I think are really important lessons.
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.260]   One, you've written an entire book
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.900]   that I would encourage people to read
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:58.020]   about when to say yes and no.
[00:59:58.020 --> 00:59:59.580]   And I think someone might look at the title,
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.420]   which is hell yeah or no, and say,
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.060]   oh, you should always either be fervently excited
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.620]   or say no to everything.
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:08.020]   I actually know that your perspective is,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.740]   it really depends on where you are in life.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.060]   And if you are very overwhelmed with things,
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:16.100]   a philosophy of hell yeah now or no is great.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.220]   But if you're earlier in your career,
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.580]   maybe you just say yes to everything.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.980]   And I've written posts in the past
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.260]   about earlier in my career,
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.380]   why saying yes is just this magical thing
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.020]   that opens all these doors
[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.100]   and lets you have new experiences.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.340]   Is there any kind of clarifying things you wanna say
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.900]   on the kind of spectrum of say no to lots of things
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:35.500]   versus say yes to everything
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.620]   that might help people overwhelmed right now?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.780]   - I'm really glad that you said that.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.660]   Yeah, in fact, you might be the first person
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:46.140]   that's ever introduced that book
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.100]   by also giving that clarifier right away.
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:49.940]   'Cause yeah, you're right.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.700]   Almost everybody looks at that and says,
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.660]   yeah, man, hell yeah or no.
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.300]   I'm just gonna follow that from now on.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.500]   And I get these emails from people
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.260]   that are like straight out of college going,
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:00:59.660]   yeah, thanks for saying that, man.
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.580]   I'm just saying no to everything
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.380]   I don't feel hell yeah about.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.940]   And I'm like, wait a second, hold on.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.940]   It's a tool for a specific situation.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.500]   It's in the toolbox.
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.620]   It's that really unique wrench
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.220]   in case you need to get into the hole
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.860]   and do a Phillips head screw.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:19.700]   In general, I think it's better to switch strategies
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.300]   for your correct situation.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.460]   So yeah, straight out of college,
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:26.820]   or if you're young and say you want more opportunities
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.700]   than you have right now,
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.780]   you want more success than you have right now.
[01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:31.620]   Yeah, very often the best solution
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.820]   is to go say yes to everything.
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.180]   Take on as much as you can take on,
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.100]   try it all, overcommit yourself
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:41.660]   and say yes to everything
[01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.900]   because it's a little bit like lottery tickets.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.060]   You never know which of these 12 things
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.420]   you're doing at once is going to reward you.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.060]   And then when one of those 12 things
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:57.380]   you're doing simultaneously rewards you,
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.380]   then you can like double down on that,
[01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:00.700]   get rid of the other 11
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.860]   and throw everything you've got into this one thing.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.820]   And then that's when you should raise the bar
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.500]   'cause hell yeah I know basically just means that.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.140]   It just means raise the bar all the way
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.420]   for what you'll accept.
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.220]   So you wanna do that if you're overwhelmed
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.900]   with opportunities and everybody wants a piece of you
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.980]   and you've got so much success coming your way,
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:25.380]   then that's when you need hell yeah or no
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.060]   as a reminder to raise the bar
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:28.340]   to let go of these other options
[01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.900]   because you've got so much going on.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.260]   So yeah, so thanks for mentioning that.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.300]   It's the very first sentence of the article
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.260]   but it often gets lost in that point.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.220]   - It could also apply to just so much going on in life.
[01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.460]   You have two young kids, you have a job,
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.980]   you have a family
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.100]   and it wasn't that there were new business opportunities
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.180]   or financial opportunities,
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.420]   it's just life got so busy that to maintain sanity,
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:50.900]   you have to raise the bar.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.460]   And I found that as a 20 something single person,
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:56.780]   people say, "Hey, you wanna go to this thing?"
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.740]   "Yeah, I wanna go to this thing."
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:58.820]   "Yeah, I wanna do this thing."
[01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.740]   It's easy.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.420]   And then we have two kids,
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.380]   my wife and I can't go out to every dinner.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.420]   We can't go to every concert.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.820]   Some of our friends without children are like,
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.460]   "Oh, do you guys wanna go to Belize for the weekend?"
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.100]   We're like, "No, that's not a thing
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.340]   "we can just do on a whim."
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.100]   And we've created an intentional life
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.060]   that we're happy with,
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.780]   but it just means we can't do those things.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.860]   So I think right now,
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:21.460]   this year is a little bit more of the year
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.340]   of the hell yeah or no than the say yes to everything.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.100]   But it's not necessarily because of opportunity,
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.660]   it's just because the overwhelming nature of life
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.140]   with young children.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:31.980]   - Thanks for mentioning that
[01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.900]   because sometimes I think in terms of like
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.740]   business career choices with hell yeah or no,
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.580]   but you're right.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.500]   It's when you've got a kid,
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.060]   that's your hell yeah or your kids.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.140]   And so that helps you say no to everything else.
[01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.620]   It helps to remember that you'd be better off
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.740]   putting more attention into your kids
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.220]   instead of spreading yourself thin with other things.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:56.020]   In fact, I feel like I've unfairly mentioned
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.180]   moving too much in this conversation,
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.020]   but I was living in Singapore when my kid was born.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.100]   And Singapore is a very exciting, distracting place.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.180]   I knew a lot of people there.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.980]   I was super social there.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.140]   There's so much going on.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.820]   And even its location within Asia is just a short hop
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.740]   to so many interesting places.
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.100]   And I noticed that the first few months of my kid's life,
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.020]   I was too distracted and I was being pulled
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:23.220]   different directions.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.420]   So a big part of the choice to move
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.860]   to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:32.740]   was to create an environment where I've just
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.540]   by side effect of my location,
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.260]   I've said no to everything else.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:40.020]   So for my kid from age zero to 10 here in New Zealand,
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.620]   I was basically a full-time dad.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.500]   I was in the middle of an island in the Pacific Ocean
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.700]   where just everything else in life became a no
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:52.140]   because I'm here with my kid and this is my hell yeah.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.180]   - So I wanna get to children,
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.460]   but I have one quick question,
[01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.300]   which is can you talk about the saying no part?
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.260]   Because I think it's very easy for a lot of people to say,
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.940]   "This is the hell yeah thing."
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.340]   And then they get an email from someone's like,
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.540]   "Hey, I'd love to pick your brain about this thing.
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.100]   Do you wanna grab a coffee?"
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.780]   And I think saying no is something people find very hard.
[01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.660]   And they almost feel like I'm gonna look bad by saying no.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.860]   People are gonna think that I don't care.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:16.900]   And you've said a few things
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.500]   that have given me perspective there
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.420]   that I think would just be helpful
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.060]   for people to understand why saying no
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:26.100]   might be in some weird way polite or a better way to do it.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.060]   - Yeah, my number one tip is write a form letter.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:36.060]   Take 20 minutes and write a very nice generic no
[01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.840]   with a little elaboration like,
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.380]   "Hey, I'm so sorry.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.600]   I'm completely focused on what I'm doing right now.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:46.280]   My new book isn't finished yet
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.240]   and I need to put everything I've got into finishing this.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.420]   I hope you'll understand.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.720]   This isn't a permanent no,
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.320]   maybe at some point in the future.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.260]   I really appreciate that you thought of me for this.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.460]   I'm honored that you invited me."
[01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:00.820]   Whatever, like take 20 minutes
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:04.620]   and write a nice form letter response
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.340]   and then keep it handy in a word file or a text file
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.340]   or whatever you use,
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.580]   so that it might even be five times a day
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.780]   when you get people wanting to pick your brain
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.960]   or come to this thing or,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.380]   "Hey dude, you got a minute to jump on a Zoom call."
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:21.260]   You could just copy paste, select all,
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.340]   Alt + Tab, Control + V, send.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.540]   I do my form letter so many times a day.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.140]   I just have a generic no.
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.300]   And what's nice is that people respond to it
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.140]   every now and then going,
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.540]   "Wow, that's the nicest no I've ever received.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.540]   And dude, you're actually kind of inspiring
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.240]   how you're keeping your head down in your work.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.820]   Man, I should be more like that."
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.220]   Like you think people are gonna be mad,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:44.360]   but actually people often get inspired
[01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.580]   by how you say no to their random things.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.340]   - I wouldn't necessarily put this in a form letter,
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:52.020]   but I heard you say once that you say no
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:55.380]   so that you leave your calendar open to say yes.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.700]   And if someone's calendar is always full,
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:58.860]   it's almost like, "Oh man,
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.020]   this person isn't leaving enough time for exciting things."
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.540]   - When I just said that like for 10 years,
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.940]   I was basically a full-time dad.
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:09.460]   Dude, for 10 years, I didn't even have a calendar.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.060]   There was like literally nothing on my calendar.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.420]   Maybe like once a year we would take a flight
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.260]   to go see his grandparents.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:21.300]   But yeah, for 10 years, I had nothing on my calendar app.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.000]   And when somebody would wanna schedule,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.740]   they're like, "Hey, can I call you next Thursday at three?"
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   I'd go, "Eh, I'm not gonna bust open the calendar app.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.860]   You'll be like the only thing in 2018
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:35.180]   on my entire calendar for the year."
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.260]   Like, no, just call.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.380]   Whenever you wanna call, just call.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.940]   I'm not gonna schedule.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.140]   I don't do scheduling.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:41.380]   I mean, now I do.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.740]   My kid's 11 now and he's playing with friends.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.020]   He doesn't need me around so much.
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.900]   So I'm not as much of a full-time dad
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900]   as I was the last 10 years.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.860]   But yeah, for 10 years,
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.780]   that was fun to just say no to all of it.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:52.980]   And to have this completely empty calendar
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.900]   is such a good feeling.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:56.100]   To wake up, God, that's one of my deepest joys,
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.380]   to wake up every day or to wake up any day
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.460]   and have nothing on my calendar for that whole day.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:04.420]   Like the whole day is mine.
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.500]   It's such a nice feeling.
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.380]   - Let's talk about some of the perspective
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.260]   you had for parenting.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.940]   Because I think right before we jumped in,
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.740]   I was sharing your post about parenting with my wife.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.060]   And we were both like, "Wow."
[01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.220]   You kind of talk in it and I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.740]   You can talk about it as much as you want.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:21.980]   It's not very long.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.300]   But how it seems like sometimes
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.540]   by focusing so much on your child,
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.180]   you're just completely selfless
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.180]   and you just can feel like work.
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.220]   But if you present it in a perspective,
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.500]   that's like, "Oh."
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.380]   By doing these things that many of us wish
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:40.260]   that we could do more for or with our children,
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.500]   you're actually doing things that will help you.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.620]   And that perspective, I know plenty of people are like,
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.060]   "Oh, my partner's gone
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.060]   "and I've got childcare duty for the whole day."
[01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:52.660]   And I think there's a different perspective
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:55.740]   of ways that you could enrich your own life,
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.380]   not just by spending time with someone,
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.860]   but by teaching lessons and acting a different way.
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.020]   I'm curious how you thought of that,
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:05.100]   how long it took you to come to those realizations.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.540]   - Remind me, where do you live now?
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.100]   - I live in the Bay Area.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.620]   - Okay, so yeah, whenever I was on daddy duty,
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.140]   'cause his mom and I always split it 50/50,
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.980]   every day or every week,
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.580]   we'd make sure that it was always 50/50.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.300]   We didn't have a nanny or anything like that.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.500]   It was always just the two of us.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.420]   And we'd live far away from family.
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.620]   So there was nobody else to help.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.660]   So it was either her on duty or me on duty.
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.660]   So she had her own way, right?
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.540]   So she likes watching things and she likes being inside.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.380]   Like that's how she grew up.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.820]   She's more indoorsy.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:34.180]   So then I found it my duty,
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.100]   whenever I was on daddy duty, to take him out.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.980]   No matter what the weather, even if it's raining,
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.260]   that was like my number one thing.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.940]   Like, let's just get out.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:46.420]   To satisfy my own curiosity,
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.700]   I would pick somewhere on the map that we had never been.
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.780]   I'd like look at the map and I'd see this green patch.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:53.220]   I'm like, I don't know what's there.
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.060]   Like today we're going there.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.700]   So we would go to that green patch,
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:01.100]   get out of the car and just hang out there for the day.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.740]   And we would spend like two hours,
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.100]   six hours in this green patch I'd never been to.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:10.820]   So I got to know the area really, really well by doing that.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:14.020]   And now let's say like, if it's really bad weather,
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.700]   there's some days where I'd say like,
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.060]   all right, let's watch a movie.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.340]   But instead of just picking the dumbest
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:25.060]   Hotel Transylvania 3 kind of entertainment,
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:28.100]   I do a little work to find some like
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.140]   beautiful award-winning animated movie from somewhere,
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.500]   ideally in another language or another culture
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.540]   that I would find really interesting.
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.300]   And I'd find this kind of like, I don't know,
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.940]   this German animated thing and subtitles.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.540]   So my kid who doesn't read is just watching this in German,
[01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.500]   but I'm like, cool.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.140]   The German language is getting into his ears
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:46.980]   a little bit today.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.820]   And I'm watching an animated movie that I find interesting,
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.300]   not just like the lowest common denominator.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:56.260]   So I would make choices like that to enrich his experience
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:59.260]   by often going somewhere new, watching something new.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.620]   Sometimes we just listen to music.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.820]   We'd kind of like cuddle and listen to say like
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.740]   Indian classical music while making Lego.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:08.580]   Actually, that was a good way.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.820]   He calls it Lego music.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.460]   Indian classical music, he considers Lego music
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.580]   because I just thought like, all right,
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.540]   as long as we're just making Lego,
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.700]   let's open his ears a bit
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.460]   and put on a different kind of music.
[01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.300]   And it had like speakers in the living room
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.620]   so he could really kind of hear it,
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.300]   not just coming out of a tinny little one inch speaker.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.540]   So yeah, choices like that, I just found to me made
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.180]   being a full-time dad, it made it a joy
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.380]   because I would keep choosing these decisions
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.580]   that were good for both of us.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.980]   - And I think one of the big ones
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.740]   that you've read about is travel.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.540]   And you wrote a post that says
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.020]   travels best with young children.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:43.220]   And I was telling my wife about it.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.620]   She's like, "How old are this guy's kids?"
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.540]   I don't think I said young.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.740]   I said, "Oh, he wrote this great post
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.580]   "about travel with children."
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:50.340]   She's like, "Yeah, but are they 15?"
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.540]   So I think there's this idea
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.780]   of traveling with young children being horrible
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.980]   and it being the worst experience.
[01:11:56.980 --> 01:12:00.180]   And you write the exact opposite.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.580]   And I've gotten so many emails from listeners saying,
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.340]   "Oh, can you talk more about travel with children
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:05.660]   "and how to make it enjoyable?"
[01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.820]   And as early as this morning,
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.380]   someone emailed me saying, "I'm going on this trip.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.380]   "I can't remember where they're going."
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.980]   She's like, "I have a six-year-old and a one-year-old
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:13.820]   "and we're nervous.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.020]   "How do you have a good trip traveling with children?"
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.380]   Very few people I know have a perspective
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.180]   of positive experience.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.420]   So I'd love to wrap up a little bit and talk about that
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.380]   because we talk about travel a lot on this show
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:26.780]   and so many people are interested.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.660]   How do you travel with your child
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:31.580]   and have a great experience when doing it?
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.380]   And what advice do you have for people
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.780]   about to go on a trip with their children?
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.660]   - I love this subject.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.100]   I wrote that post because I got so frustrated
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.500]   at people acting like it was just a truism,
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.380]   like traveling with kids is hard
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.580]   or once you have kids, you can't travel anymore.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.700]   I was like, "Damn."
[01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.380]   Like the difference between in theory and in practice,
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.700]   some people just decide in advance in theory,
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:54.340]   "Well, can't travel anymore.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:55.820]   "Got kids now.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.980]   "Just gonna have to stay put.
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.620]   "No more dreaming for me."
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:03.020]   But in practice, it's wonderful.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:04.900]   Maybe you need to just change your mindset
[01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:05.860]   about it in advance,
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.980]   but I just find that for one,
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.140]   you don't need to pack hardly anything
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.940]   because anywhere you go has stuff for kids.
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.500]   I started traveling with our kid
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:21.220]   when he was three months old and in diapers.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.060]   And you realize you don't need to pack 50 diapers.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.060]   You need to pack like six diapers,
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.820]   maybe to get you through the first day
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.900]   'cause anywhere you're gonna go has diapers.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.660]   You don't need to pack toys
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:34.340]   because anywhere you go is gonna have toys.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.340]   And if he's really stuck for entertainment
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.260]   and really needs a physical thing
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.140]   beyond just the one or two things that you bring with,
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:45.740]   then there are new physical things wherever you go.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:48.420]   And I don't mean like things to buy.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:53.420]   It may just be like random items found in the grass
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.300]   or on the street corner can be fascinating.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.420]   God, he got so much joy out of this like rusty spring
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.060]   he found once in the gutter.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:05.060]   We went to Wales and he found this rusty spring
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.300]   in the gutter that he just held onto for a week
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.020]   and just loved this spring.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.820]   And it was like his favorite toy for the whole week
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.260]   while we were traveling in England
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:14.500]   that he found in literally in the gutter in Wales.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.540]   So you don't need to pack much.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.380]   That's a big one.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.660]   As long as you leave early,
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:24.340]   like don't forget that the airport itself
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:27.380]   is a fascinating destination for kids.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:30.780]   Like, oh my God, it might as well practically be Disneyland.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.580]   There is so much there.
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:36.700]   So you get to the airport way early, like four hours early.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   There's no rush, there's no stress
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.460]   because your kids love to explore the airport.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.260]   Even when he's just a little choo-choo crawling baby,
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.380]   he loved the attention from so many strangers.
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.020]   Like suddenly there's like hundreds of faces looking at him
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.220]   and he'd be like, ah, you know,
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.340]   like so many strangers wanna play with him.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:57.260]   He loved hanging out at the airport.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.660]   So then the flight itself, my number one advice
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.660]   for kids under the age of two or three is,
[01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.460]   I know this is gonna sound radical,
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.820]   but I actually got this from a great book
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:10.140]   called "Brain Rules for Baby" by John Medina.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.140]   University of Washington, a neuroscientist
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:16.340]   has been studying brain development in babies for years.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.740]   And his number one bit of advice,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:19.980]   oh, sorry, number two bit of advice.
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.740]   Number one bit of advice was help your kids feel safe.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.460]   Like number one, kids need to feel safe so they can flourish.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:29.860]   But number two was, he said, no screens before the age of two.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.460]   And in fact, the longer they can go without screens
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:34.580]   in front of them, the better.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.940]   But he said like, absolutely do not let your kid
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:41.140]   stare at a screen before the age of two.
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:44.860]   So I heeded his advice and we had no screens in the house,
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:48.700]   no iPads, no movies, whatever, before the age of two.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.540]   But the one exception is when we would get on a flight.
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.460]   And because he'd had no screens at all in his life,
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.220]   you wonder how to keep a kid still in a seat,
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.620]   like let them watch the screen.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:06.220]   Suddenly he was just hypnotized and he would be absolutely still
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:10.500]   on a flight to the point where many different times when
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.380]   the flight was done, we'd be getting up, exiting the plane,
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.620]   and somebody in front of us or behind us
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.620]   would go, whoa, there was a kid here that whole time.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.340]   And they didn't even know because their kid
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.220]   was so hypnotized by the screen.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:24.420]   So I don't know, that was a good hack.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.020]   And hey, that's why we're here, right?
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:26.700]   All the hacks.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:27.700]   So that was a good hack.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.700]   And then when you get to a place,
[01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:35.060]   you don't try to force your kid into your adult schedule.
[01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.300]   You don't say, all right, we're going to Paris,
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.140]   we're going to see the Louvre, we're
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.220]   going to see the Eiffel Tower, we're
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:40.940]   going to look at the Arc de Triomphe at 1 o'clock,
[01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.020]   and we're going to get it.
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.540]   You just let go of all that.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:49.060]   Traveling with kids is so nice to just get to a destination
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.580]   and let go of your expectations to basically let
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.460]   your kid and circumstance lead the way.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:57.940]   You're just going to get there, and then you just
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.780]   go out into the world with your kid and let them explore
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.140]   and let them lead the way.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.620]   Isn't that a Whitney Houston song?
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.500]   You just let them lead and be on their schedule.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.860]   What I love about that is then you
[01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:12.380]   get to experience this place through your kid's eyes.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.700]   So I remember taking my kid to Thailand
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.980]   when he was like six months old.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.820]   He was a crawling baby.
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:19.780]   He wasn't even walking.
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:21.580]   He was just crawling.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.300]   And we would just go someplace like a temple that
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.380]   was gorgeous with the big golden stupas
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.860]   and just let him crawl around.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.820]   And he would just be crawling around the temple,
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.100]   and everybody's giving him attention.
[01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:33.620]   He'd play with strangers.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.540]   A Buddhist monk picks him up and holds him,
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.780]   and he's loving this attention.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.940]   And people take his picture, and he
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.140]   crawls around the whole time.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.420]   We're just laid back, kind of like enjoying the temple
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.780]   and our baby crawling around.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.340]   And same thing with just going out to a park,
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.700]   and he's seeing different things.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:48.780]   He sees monkeys.
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.260]   Oh my god.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:56.820]   It's all so easy when you let your kid lead the way.
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.300]   Locals connect with you more.
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:01.220]   Everybody wants to come up and interact with the baby.
[01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:03.260]   So all these locals that don't speak English,
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:05.500]   and we can't communicate through language,
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.900]   but sweet old ladies come up, and they
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.500]   want to play with your baby.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.380]   I absolutely love it.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.300]   I kind of don't want to travel without my kid,
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.460]   I think, traveling with my kid at any age.
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.180]   And even now, he just turned 11.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.100]   I just took him to Japan for two weeks.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.340]   His mom had to work, so it was just me and him.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.580]   And it was amazing to go see Japan through his eyes.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.540]   I've been to Japan a few times.
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.780]   In my life, but I kept myself out of it.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:31.620]   I just took us to Kanazawa on the West Coast,
[01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.180]   and we just stayed there for four days,
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.260]   and down to Kyoto for four days, then up to Tokyo for four days.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.860]   Stopped at one hot springs resort town on the way
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.340]   so I could experience a real hot springs resort.
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.900]   And other than that, just day to day, we'd wake up,
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.060]   and I'd say, all right, dude, what do you want to do?
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.100]   You lead.
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:50.900]   I'll follow you.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.940]   And it was so unexpected.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:55.860]   I thought he'd be overwhelmed by Tokyo,
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:56.740]   but he loved it.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.660]   In fact, sometimes when I was kind of tired,
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.260]   he's like, let's go out again.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.740]   He said, let's go down this alley.
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.060]   And I just let him lead the way.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:04.980]   He's like, let's go see what's upstairs.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:06.180]   All right, sure.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:07.100]   And it was great.
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.620]   It introduced so much randomness.
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.580]   He chose things I wouldn't have chosen.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.260]   He's like my favorite travel partner
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.140]   and has been since he was born.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:20.340]   So I think travel with kids is easy and wonderful.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:23.940]   We went to London and Paris in December with two kids,
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.700]   six months and 2 and 1/2.
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.420]   We didn't try to cram in the Louvre.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.620]   We picked places that, at least in Paris's case,
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.020]   we'd both been to before.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.980]   One of the challenges that I'm curious to hear
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:36.100]   your perspective on, maybe this gets better
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.100]   after multiple times.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.820]   This is our first kind of trip to a city with kids.
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.260]   A part of it was like, oh, we're so
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:44.220]   used to how much we try to accomplish on a trip.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:47.820]   With children, you just have to cut your expectations way back.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:51.140]   So I think if we wanted to have an enjoyable trip each day,
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.900]   the goal was, what's the one thing we're going to do today?
[01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.460]   Our list pre-kids was like, here's the eight things we'll do.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.100]   Now it's one.
[01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:01.060]   And I wonder now if we went back--
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.380]   we weren't going in with eight.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:06.140]   Maybe we had two and we realized one was more sustainable.
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:09.020]   But if you go all the way, halfway across the world,
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.980]   not everyone has months at a time.
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.820]   So let's say you're there for a week
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.620]   and you're only doing one thing a day.
[01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:17.820]   You might feel like you didn't get as much value out
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.340]   of the trip because you spent all this money to travel
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.380]   and stay and eat, but you didn't get to do that much.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.460]   I have a feeling that you have a way
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:31.180]   to rephrase the perspective that will make anyone listening
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.820]   realize that they got just as much of a trip
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.440]   even though it was different.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.020]   But I feel like the way you'll say it
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.380]   will give people that feeling far greater than the way
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:39.900]   I would.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:43.260]   So I'm curious how you would kind of rebut the idea
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.260]   that if you're not doing a lot because you can't have
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.420]   as much on your agenda, you're not
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.540]   going to have the kind of trip that will make it worth it.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.460]   I figure that if I've decided I want to go to Paris,
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.420]   and I've got that specific example too,
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.860]   I'm just choosing the where.
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.260]   I'm just saying, we're going to Paris.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.260]   And I'll say, OK.
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:04.060]   So I took us to Paris.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.460]   And once we got out of the train station at the Gare du Nord,
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:10.980]   is that it, the north one, I think, I just let him choose.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:12.540]   I was like, well, we're in Paris now.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.900]   Which way do you want to go?
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.860]   And he was like, go that way.
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:16.580]   I said, OK.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.180]   And I just followed him.
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:20.340]   And I'm so glad I did.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:24.100]   Because at every turn, he just decided where he wanted to go.
[01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.220]   He led the way.
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:28.100]   And at one point, he found this huge cardboard box
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.860]   that was as big as he is.
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:33.620]   And he's like, dad, check out this box.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:35.500]   And he got inside this cardboard box.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.380]   And for the next half an hour, he
[01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:42.020]   walked the streets of Paris inside a big cardboard box.
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:43.680]   And I got such joy out of that.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.260]   I made a little phone movie of it,
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.980]   of the streets of Paris, in a busy center part of town,
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.980]   with him taking up the whole sidewalk,
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.900]   walking inside this big cardboard box.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.220]   Everybody doing these double takes, like, what the hell?
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.020]   And me just cracking up at the juxtaposition of,
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.580]   not only is my kid taking up the sidewalk,
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:06.220]   walking in a huge cardboard box, but OMFG Paris.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:07.980]   Like, to be doing this in Paris.
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:11.020]   And oh my god, there's the Eiffel Tower in the background,
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.140]   as my kid is walking in a cardboard box.
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:16.460]   And then at some point, he sees a huge staircase.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.700]   It's starting to get dark.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.180]   It's dusk.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:20.380]   And he's like, whoa.
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:21.880]   He's like, look at all those stairs.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.580]   He said, let's go this way.
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:23.700]   I said, all right.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.820]   He's out of the box at this point.
[01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:30.420]   And we go up, and up, and up, and up, and up these steps.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.260]   And we get to the top.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.740]   And we take this turn.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.780]   And it's like, oh, one of the most top five beautiful things
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.820]   I've ever seen in my life.
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:42.140]   He accidentally led us to Sacré-Cœur,
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.900]   the big, giant cathedral, which, just because it was dusk,
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.740]   was being lit up by floodlights.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.660]   But the sky was dark blue.
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:52.160]   And it's at the top of the stairs, but you don't expect it.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.340]   You turn up the stairs, and suddenly, it's
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:55.260]   just staring at you.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.660]   And it's like, oh my god, it looks so surreal.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.860]   And it was one of my favorite things on that whole trip,
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.620]   was us accidentally discovering Sacré-Cœur,
[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.340]   which I'd only seen in postcards or photos at that point.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:09.460]   I'd never seen it in person.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.180]   And it was only because he led the way.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.940]   That wasn't on my itinerary.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.140]   And I wouldn't have put it on my itinerary.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:18.500]   I didn't even really know what it was called.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.100]   I had just seen pictures of it before.
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:25.060]   But yeah, letting your kids lead the way makes them happy.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:28.540]   And it leads to so many wonderful random encounters.
[01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:31.860]   Yeah, I think it's just about reframing
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.220]   what makes a good trip, right?
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.020]   In an earlier life, a great trip to Paris
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:39.520]   might have involved ticking off a few restaurants
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.980]   your friends had recommended, seeing a few museums.
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.260]   As you were talking, what really clicked for me
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.940]   was I thought, OK, well, if we're not
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.900]   going to go do all those things, and we're just
[01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.500]   going to walk around, then we could just do that here.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.300]   Why do we need to go all the way to Paris?
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.460]   But there's something about being in Paris,
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.080]   doing that, that makes the memories different.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.580]   And the memories are why you're doing it in the first place.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.100]   So I want to challenge myself on the next trip
[01:24:06.100 --> 01:24:10.740]   to just kind of let go, do whatever, see where it goes,
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:14.020]   and see if we have just a totally different type of memory
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.500]   that's equally or potentially even better than we used to.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:18.860]   It's just uncomfortable, right?
[01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.300]   Because it's not a type of thing I'm familiar with,
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.420]   because that's not how we would travel pre-kid.
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:27.460]   So we found the travel logistics to not be as overwhelming
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.800]   as much as the trying to find the balance between--
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.020]   I don't know, my wife and I, when we're in new cities,
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.460]   we're like, let's go find a cool bar
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.620]   and have a good cocktail, or let's go eat
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:39.020]   whatever the local food is.
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.500]   And so it's like, OK, well, we got to get to this restaurant.
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:44.420]   But in London, nothing opens early enough
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:45.820]   to eat before kids' nap time.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.320]   But if we reframed it and just said,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.660]   we're not going to have the trip we wanted to have when
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.780]   we were 10 years younger.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.420]   We're going to have a different style trip where our children
[01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:56.740]   experience things, and we get to watch that unfold,
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.300]   I think it would have been different.
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.200]   And I think we maybe had the wrong expectations.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.580]   We still had a great trip, but I think
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:02.920]   we could have had a better trip.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.280]   I find it really important--
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.400]   this is just my values.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.120]   Nobody listening has to adopt my values.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.360]   But a lot of the reason I was traveling
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.200]   was for him as much as me because I
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:21.260]   wanted him to know that Paris is a place that he's been
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.960]   and has a connection to.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.320]   So the trip was--
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.280]   when you say like, why not just stay home?
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.680]   Yeah, the trip was for him as much as me to know--
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.400]   he can identify so many countries on a map
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.480]   now at age 11.
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.000]   And he's got a little connection to so many of them,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.340]   even some that he hasn't been to.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.440]   But I want him to feel a connection to the world.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.840]   So when somebody says France, he's like, oh, yeah,
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.680]   I've been there.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.400]   And if somebody says Spain, he's like, oh, yeah, I've been there.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.160]   I wanted that for his self-identity.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.000]   I want him to feel that the world is his home,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   not just this one country where we're in right now,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.720]   but all of it, like the more of it, the better.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.040]   So I generally would take him on trips
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.080]   to places we've never been.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   Let him lead the way.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.760]   He gets to feel the sense of autonomy.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.680]   You never have to worry about him being happy.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.520]   Because if your kid is leading the way--
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.720]   I wouldn't know how to do it with two kids.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:13.260]   I don't know.
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.560]   But if your kid's leading the way, then he's happy.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.640]   And you get the randomness.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.880]   But it's more about just your kid feeling a connection
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.920]   to this place on Earth.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.200]   That was most important to me.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.080]   I didn't really care what we did in the place.
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.400]   But the reason I gasped while you were saying that is--
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.400]   Chris, satisficing and maximizing,
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.680]   it comes back full circle to earlier in the conversation
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.720]   of you just described a way of travel
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.120]   that was trying to maximize.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.560]   You're like, all right, we've got 72 hours in Paris.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.680]   We are going to go to the best restaurants, the best
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.240]   sites, the best museum.
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.800]   That's maximizing.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.080]   And I think that's the wrong strategy.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.160]   I think satisficing is the correct strategy
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.120]   for travel with kids.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.660]   You're just like, all right, I'm just
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.760]   going to book us a trip to Paris.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.200]   And we're going to get off.
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.480]   And we're going to spend a few days in Paris.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.780]   I don't know what's going to happen while we're there.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.000]   We'll see what happens.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.160]   But we're going to spend three days in Paris
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.400]   with no expectations.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.200]   That's probably a better recipe for happiness.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.880]   It's my eternal struggle, is to satisfice.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.280]   But I will continue to try to make gains
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.960]   towards more satisficing.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.520]   You should read that book.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.800]   You should read "Hyperoxygen."
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.840]   It's going to stack up a bunch of reasons why you should.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.560]   I already have it written down.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.640]   I try not to be distracted and write things down.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.320]   But every now and then in a conversation,
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.120]   I'm like, well, that deserves to be written down.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.860]   OK, so there's two final things.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.160]   One is around satisficing.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.960]   There is a story I've somehow managed to hear you tell twice.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.000]   I've picked random things.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.920]   And sometimes I read it.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.760]   And sometimes I'm like, oh, let's just play.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.240]   And on your site, you read some of your posts.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.760]   And it's a perspective that sometimes
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:54.320]   taking a different path, taking the not perfect optimal
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.800]   maximizing path might actually not result in as worse
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.120]   of an outcome as you seem.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.960]   So one of the reasons I think a lot of us maximize
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.080]   is that we're like, we want the best.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.360]   We want the optimal outcome.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.160]   And if you don't get it, in our minds,
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.280]   it feels like you'll be spending so much more money.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.880]   But it might actually only be $10.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.160]   Could you talk about this bike ride
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.760]   where you stop to slow down?
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.400]   Because I think it's a good way to wrap up the conversation.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.600]   Because sometimes just taking a different path,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.640]   it doesn't actually mean that you're
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.520]   getting a much worse outcome in terms of, in your case,
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.240]   how long it took.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:28.800]   Right.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.160]   OK, so first the story.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:34.600]   And then how it ties back into what we've been talking about.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.080]   OK.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.520]   Because the story is about what happened.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.360]   And then how it ties back in is about
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.580]   the psychological experience in your mind,
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.000]   not just the physical experience.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.760]   OK, so the story of what actually happened
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.240]   is when I was living in Santa Monica, California
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.160]   on the beach, there is a bike path
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.560]   that goes through the sand there.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.220]   And I think it's 15 miles or something like that.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.400]   And for exercise, almost every day,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.200]   I would at some point stop what I was doing.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.680]   And I'd get on my bike.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.280]   And I would do that bike path as fast as I could,
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:10.240]   really head down and kind of pushing as hard as I could
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.400]   to do this in the name of exercise.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.360]   I'm going to do this track.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.640]   And I would do the 15 miles back and forth.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.520]   I don't remember if it was exactly 15 miles.
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.760]   But I do remember that after the first or second time,
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.120]   the time it would take me was almost always exactly 43
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.160]   minutes.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.880]   If it was a really windy day, maybe a little more,
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:32.160]   but almost never less than 43 minutes.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.280]   So 43 minutes every time.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.320]   But after doing this for a few months,
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.800]   I realized I was getting less motivated to do it.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:43.060]   It's like, it's not so much fun, this kind of--
[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:44.360]   I always get really red-faced.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.600]   It would take me like an hour to cool down afterwards.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.880]   I have to take a cold shower.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.920]   And even then, I would continue sweating
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.200]   even after a cold shower.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.480]   So one day, I was just like, I just need to chill.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.400]   I'm just going to relax and do the same ride,
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:02.000]   but at half my normal pace.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:02.920]   So I get on my bike.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.920]   And I'm just like, ah, da-da-da-da-da.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.320]   Just going like a granny, sitting more upright,
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.200]   looking around.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:13.080]   And I was just on my same path.
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.440]   And there were dolphins jumping in the ocean that day.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.440]   I was like, oh, wow, dolphins.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.320]   That's so badass.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:19.640]   I grew up in Chicago.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.040]   I'm looking at dolphins.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.960]   And yes, in the Marina Del Rey, I went to--
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:26.600]   under Marina Del Rey, there were a whole bunch of pelicans
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:30.000]   that were perching on the breakwater thing.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.160]   And at one point, when I rode my bike near them,
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.040]   the pelicans all went, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.160]   I was like, whoa, pelicans.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.640]   And then like, ah, one of them shit in my mouth.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.720]   It was like the taste of digested oyster.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.960]   The shells were like, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.560]   So that was a really unique experience.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.680]   So then I get back to my starting point,
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.680]   where I would always time myself.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.040]   And I looked at my watch.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.720]   And it had been 45 minutes.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.880]   I was like, wait a minute.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.240]   No way.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.840]   Like, I'm usually doing it in 43 minutes.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.880]   I thought it would be like an hour and a half.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.680]   I felt like I was going half speed.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.640]   But I guess just because of the strength of my legs or whatever,
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:13.680]   I was going about the same pace, even though it
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.800]   felt like half the effort.
[01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.720]   So that just blew my mind.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.880]   And yeah, I double checked.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.760]   Yeah, 45 minutes.
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.120]   Oh, my god.
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:26.600]   So that became a metaphor for how you can just relax and put
[01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.280]   in so much less effort and get almost the same result,
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:32.760]   objectively.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.320]   But psychologically, you feel so much better about it.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:42.280]   So yeah, full circle to what we're talking about,
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:46.520]   whether it's travel or decision making.
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.600]   To me, the psychological experience
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.640]   matters more than anything.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:58.000]   So yes, I could force my kid to go to the eight things
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.920]   I want to see in Paris and force him to sit next to me
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.280]   at a fancy restaurant that he doesn't like.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.880]   Because damn it, it says that this
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.240]   has the best creme brulee in Paris.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.360]   And I could make him do this.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.560]   And objectively, I could say that
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:16.000]   might cram in more experiences and technically
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.160]   make a better holiday.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.240]   But guess what?
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.200]   The psychological experience of it
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.160]   would be worse than if I just book the flight, get there,
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.240]   and just let my kid lead the way.
[01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:31.280]   I might see less stuff, but the psychological experience of it
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.040]   will be better.
[01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:34.720]   I definitely value and prioritize
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.600]   the psychological, the inner experience of something.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.880]   To me, you kind of satisfies the bike ride,
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.280]   which is you didn't try to get the ultimate maximum output
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:44.080]   from riding it.
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.520]   And in return, you actually got the maximum output.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.040]   You did.
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.040]   You actually were able to get 99% of the output
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:52.640]   in terms of physical output.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:55.320]   But then you also got to enjoy the bike ride and all that.
[01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.080]   And to the Paris example, the funniest part
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.560]   is to the average untrained American palate,
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.200]   I am fairly confident that the average creme brulee in Paris
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.920]   is going to be better than any creme brulee you've had.
[01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:09.800]   So does it need to be the best croissant or the best creme
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:10.600]   brulee?
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:13.760]   And I say this as someone who just recently searched for,
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.040]   oh, let's go to this bakery.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.240]   They have the best this.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.840]   We did have one terrible croissant in Paris.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:22.080]   But for the most part, the random croissant at any bakery
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.080]   is so good that I would tell you,
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:28.080]   even though I find it hard to take my own advice,
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.160]   that don't track to the best one in the world.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.880]   Just track to a good one.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.440]   And enjoy that, and it will probably
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:39.400]   be a better experience than schlepping the whole family
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.840]   on the metro to go seven stops early in the morning
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.800]   so you don't have to wait too long of a line.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.920]   And I say this as advice it's hard for me to take myself,
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.880]   but hopefully the pain I've endured to say it
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.480]   can save people some misery.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:56.520]   I have internalized satisficing so much
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.680]   that when I go to a restaurant, and I don't even
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.200]   really care what restaurant I go to,
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.360]   I don't even maximize that.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.680]   Whatever is nearby, it's fine.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.320]   I'm sure it's fine, as long as it doesn't completely suck.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.040]   If I see the one with the little flies
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.760]   and the broken fluorescent light, all right,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.880]   maybe not that one.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.720]   Maybe that one across the street instead.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.760]   I can walk into almost any restaurant,
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.000]   and my friends tease me for this.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.240]   Here's how I order.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.400]   I flip open the menu, and basically the first thing I see
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.840]   in the first three seconds, I'm like, there.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:24.680]   I just close the menu.
[01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:25.640]   I'm like, that's what I'm having.
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:27.480]   And they're just like, you didn't look at everything.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.760]   I'm like, I don't need to look at everything.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.360]   I'm just gonna eat something, and it's gonna be fine.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.680]   Like, I don't even need to order the best thing on the menu.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.160]   Just whatever.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.920]   Or if I don't even feel like looking at the menu,
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.480]   and the waiter comes by early,
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.560]   I'll just say, what's your best thing?
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.400]   Or, what do you recommend?
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.440]   What's your most popular dish?
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.240]   And they'll say, oh, the, whatever, the chili.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.040]   I'm like, yeah, give me that then.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.800]   Like, I don't even look at the menu sometimes.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.000]   I really, really deeply internalized the lessons
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.320]   from "The Paradox of Choice" book.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.600]   - Well, I'm gonna recommend everyone check out
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.800]   both the writings you've had,
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.200]   the books you've written, and that book.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.080]   The one thing, I haven't done this as frequently
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.520]   as I wanted to, but I ask people,
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.200]   because everyone here likes to travel,
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.040]   is there a place, and I'm hoping
[01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.400]   that you use somewhere in New Zealand,
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:13.520]   since I've been dying for an excuse to go,
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.240]   that you're familiar with enough,
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.760]   feel free to choose anywhere in the world,
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.080]   that if someone were heading there,
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:22.080]   you'd recommend a couple places that are your favorite
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.920]   anywhere in the world.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.960]   - Let me start with a do not do in New Zealand.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.760]   If you come to New Zealand,
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:31.120]   do not spend a single minute in any city.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.360]   New Zealand is not Europe.
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.080]   In Europe, the cities contain the culture of the place.
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:40.000]   In New Zealand, the cities are just dumb, generic cities.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.480]   There is nothing special about any city in New Zealand.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.160]   Everything that's wonderful about New Zealand
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.800]   is contained in the rural nature countryside,
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:50.040]   or in the cute, small, little towns.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.080]   So what you must do when you come to New Zealand
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.560]   is just rent a car, whether you rent a car
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.840]   at the Auckland Airport and drive south,
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:01.400]   or connect to Christchurch and just rent a car
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:03.440]   at the Christchurch Airport and drive west.
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.720]   Just drive away from the city.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.160]   Don't spend a single minute in any city in New Zealand.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.960]   Okay, so that's number one.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.040]   What to do, honestly, I'm just gonna leave this open.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.000]   I think the best thing to do then is rent a car,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.880]   install the booking.com app on your phone,
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.640]   because every single motel in New Zealand,
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.800]   and there are hundreds, maybe thousands
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.120]   of these cute little motels, they're all on this app,
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.000]   and it will show you your immediate availability.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.540]   So you can just be impulsive.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.920]   You don't even need to book everything in advance.
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.760]   You can just go on a drive and see what looks appealing
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.800]   and say like, what's that over there?
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.400]   Let's just go there.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.960]   And then when it's getting late afternoon
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.280]   and you're feeling like it's time to pick
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.880]   where you're gonna stay, you just open the app with the GPS
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.360]   and it says like, okay, here's the six motels in your area
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.420]   that have availability, and you just pick one.
[01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:53.480]   And they're all good.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.520]   My favorite road trips in New Zealand
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.880]   have been through this method with no plan.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.000]   I just go to a certain direction
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.800]   and the whole country is so safe and the people are so nice
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.640]   and there are plenty of motels.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.900]   And that's more than telling you one destination to go to.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.740]   It's that.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:12.240]   But lastly, if I had to pick just one,
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   if you've got little kids, one hour north of Wellington,
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:22.320]   there is a very special place called Stag Lands.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.760]   S-T-A-G, L-A-N-D-S.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.520]   It is an open like petting zoo kind of thing.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:31.840]   The animals are not in cages, they're just roaming around.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.600]   And all of the animals will eat out of your hand
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.560]   and you can just go up to whether it's like deer
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.160]   or birds or peacocks, geese, little pigs.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.640]   Yeah, everything will eat out of your hand
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.480]   and you just like pet them
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.540]   and you're just surrounded in this wonderful like valley
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:49.020]   full of animals.
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.580]   And especially if you get to go on a weekday,
[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.940]   you'll be one of the only people there.
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:54.420]   It's just, it's a really, really, really special place.
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.960]   So there's my secret hidden recommendation.
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.800]   But actually, you know what?
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:00.780]   Anybody, if you're coming to New Zealand, email me
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.140]   and I'll give you more examples.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.180]   Go to my website, you click contact
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:05.460]   and there's my email address.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.860]   I really enjoy my open inbox.
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:09.340]   The reason I do interviews like this
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.940]   is because of the people I meet,
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:12.700]   the people who listen to these things.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:15.520]   And come on, if you've heard my voice for an hour and a half,
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.760]   then send me an email, say hello, introduce yourself.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.040]   And if you're coming to New Zealand,
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:23.560]   definitely let me know and I'll give you more detailed tips.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:25.240]   'Cause I've been here for 10 years now
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:29.000]   and I know most of the secret places.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:29.920]   - It's on our list.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:30.760]   We have kids.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.160]   Stag lands will be on the list as well.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:34.360]   This has been so much fun.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.460]   I'm sure we could go longer,
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.640]   but I would love to wrap up and just say,
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:40.520]   is there any final place you'd like people to check out
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.400]   or anywhere you'd like to send them
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.860]   before we go?
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:46.380]   - I really like hearing from strangers.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.700]   I really enjoy it when people introduce themselves.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.920]   It's like a deepest sense of joy to me
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:53.100]   to know people from around the world.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.260]   So yeah, any fans of Chris's all the hacks,
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:00.460]   go send me an email, go to my website, sive.rs.
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:02.460]   And you don't even have to ask me a question,
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.620]   just introduce yourself and say hi.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:05.460]   - That's awesome.
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:07.260]   Well, I know you enjoy email and you respond
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:09.100]   because that's how this all started.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:10.860]   So I'm so glad we got to do it.
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:12.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.480]   - Thanks Chris.

[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.680]   (bubbles popping)
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.680]   (bubbles popping)
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:47.520]   (bubbles popping)
