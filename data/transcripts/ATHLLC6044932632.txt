[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.600]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.300]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.140]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and today I'm talking
[00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.880]   to one of my favorite authors, Derek Sivers.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.960]   He has a seemingly unlimited arsenal
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.920]   of incredible life advice that comes
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.020]   from one of the most unconventional life paths
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720]   I've ever come across.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.200]   He started his career as a professional musician,
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.900]   ended up joining the circus for almost 10 years
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.640]   until he started CD Baby,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.100]   which became the largest seller of independent music
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.040]   on the web in the early 2000s,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.380]   with over $100 million in sales.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.180]   In 2008, he sold the company,
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.460]   giving away most of the proceeds to charity,
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.860]   and has been focused on a life
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.340]   of creating and learning ever since.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.780]   We're all fortunate for that path
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.540]   because of the amazing writing he's done since then.
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.460]   So today, I'm gonna try to give you a glimpse
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.160]   at that wisdom as it relates to decision-making,
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.540]   aligning your actions with your personal values,
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.420]   living a more satisfying life,
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.000]   creating meaningful experiences, and a lot more.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.640]   We'll also talk about why Derek thinks traveling
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920]   with children is easier
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.680]   than just about any other parent I've met.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.800]   It's a lot to cover,
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.880]   and I really hope you enjoy this episode.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.960]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.080]   With the tax filing deadline around the corner,
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.040]   you're probably dreading sifting through all the paperwork
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   to find those donation receipts,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.800]   or wondering if you missed out on maximizing
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   one of the most generous tax deductions,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.640]   charitable contributions.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.620]   Well, thanks to Daffy,
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.340]   I never have to go digging through emails or desk drawers
[00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.900]   to find my donation receipts,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.500]   and I'm proud to be partnering with them for this episode
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.060]   because they've helped me be more intentional with my giving
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.740]   and maximize the tax benefits of charitable giving
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.060]   all in one place.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.460]   Daffy is a modern platform and app for charitable giving,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.980]   allowing you to give to any 501(c)(3) across the US
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.420]   with just a few taps.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.820]   And because it houses all your charitable contributions,
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.020]   you only have one place to go at tax time,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.560]   and you can easily automate and optimize your giving.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.720]   Daffy does all of that by helping you set up
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.960]   a donor advised fund or DAF,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.800]   which is a tax advantaged account
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.640]   that lets you contribute cash, stock, or crypto
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.960]   on a one-time or recurring basis.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.000]   Take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.460]   and then distribute that money
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.040]   to over one and a half million charities, schools,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.460]   and faith-based organizations whenever you want to.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.720]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.000]   Derek, thanks for being here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.400]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.720]   - So from the outside looking in,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.360]   when I read everything you write, I'm like,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.960]   gosh, this guy has it all figured out.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.280]   And for every aspect of life, I'm always like,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.680]   oh, there's probably a post Derek wrote.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.160]   I could just search up about this thing.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.200]   I'm trying to make a decision or be a better parent.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.320]   Do you feel like you have everything figured out?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.040]   - I'm an explorer.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   So at any given moment, I might have figured out right now
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.440]   or I might've figured out yesterday's exploration
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.520]   and what I want to do about it,
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.840]   but then give it a few days and I'm off to somewhere new.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.580]   - I want to make a bit of a theme of this
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.560]   because I think the average person listening
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520]   isn't comfortable with that level of exploration
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.360]   in their life.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.040]   How do you get comfortable saying,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560]   well, maybe I don't have to have this job.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.320]   Maybe I don't have to live in this place
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.400]   and reframing it around what you want to do in the moment
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.080]   or what you should be doing.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.800]   Is there a thing, maybe a tapiness
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.120]   that you kind of use to guide your exploration?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.920]   - Intellectual interest, but also I'm usually led
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.840]   by whatever it feels I'm lacking now.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.960]   And it sounds weird to put that so bluntly,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.900]   but say you might be living in the middle of a city
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.320]   and you're too hectic and you're too booked up
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.640]   and you've got too many things going on
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.600]   and you think, if only I could go live
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.480]   in the middle of nowhere in the country.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.080]   And so you do that, you make some changes in your life,
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.960]   you make your job remote or whatever it may be.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.640]   And then you move off to the middle of nowhere
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.320]   and you get there and you go, ah, I've done it.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.880]   And after a week or a month, you go,
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.960]   yeah, I kind of miss a little commotion.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.460]   And so you start pursuing something
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.500]   to put a little commotion back in your life.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.460]   I think we're often driven by what we feel
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.180]   that we're lacking right now.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.060]   And so I do that too.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.500]   It's like the pendulum swinging.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.900]   The pendulum goes too far off to one end
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.140]   and it kind of goes, ah, I wish I had a little gravity
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.500]   bringing me back to the center.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.820]   And so the pendulum swings back to the center,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.420]   but then it keeps swinging to the other end
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.860]   and it goes, ah, yeah, I wish I had something
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.540]   bringing me back there again.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.400]   So that's probably driving a lot of my pursuits.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.520]   But let's say that combined with the intellectual curiosity
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.160]   drives you to just try something new.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.600]   - Now, if we rewind, you said the person living in the city
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.240]   feels overwhelmed so they move to the middle of nowhere.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.200]   I imagine that most of those people
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.960]   are actually not going to do the move.
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.840]   I think most of the people probably get stuck in a situation
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.200]   saying, I'm living in the city, everything's overwhelming.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.180]   Wouldn't it be nice to go just disconnect for a month,
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.020]   but I just can't do that.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.620]   So I want to rewind to that narrative
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.500]   and say, how have you been the kind of person
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.060]   that's been able to do that when so many people six months later
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.220]   are still saying, I'm still in the city,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.300]   I'm still overwhelmed, I'm still frustrated in my job?
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.020]   Is there some thing that you've unlocked
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.420]   that allows you to do what so many people can't?
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.060]   - I think I've always pursued that, even since I was a teenager.
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.900]   Now, hold on.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.180]   You said one key thing in there.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.260]   You said three months later or six months later.
[00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.540]   It might take a couple of years.
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.460]   When I was 25, I was a touring musician playing the college
[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.760]   market in the Northeast.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.660]   And I decided to move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.740]   And I did it, kind of like the little scenario I just described.
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.980]   I had enough of New York City.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.140]   I'd been living right in the middle of New York City
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.920]   for five years, six years.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.180]   And I was just like, I've had enough.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.820]   I want to move to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.500]   I think that's my place.
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.060]   And so I just did it.
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.920]   I just drove up there one day.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.740]   I went straight to the Century 21 real estate office.
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.120]   And I said, show me what you got.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.740]   I want to live here now.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.020]   And she showed me something.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.440]   And I was like, I could afford it.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   So I said, OK, I'll take it.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.380]   And got rid of my life in Queens, New York,
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.700]   and moved to Woodstock, New York.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.700]   And about a month later, I was at a gig in Rhode Island
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.940]   somewhere.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.180]   And Renee, this redhead who had hired me for the gig,
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.420]   I had known her from before.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.700]   She had hired me like two years earlier.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.460]   And she said, oh my god, good to see you again.
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.220]   How's it going?
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.300]   And I said, well, I just moved to Woodstock.
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.060]   And she goes, get out.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.780]   No way.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.660]   Derek, oh my god.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.820]   That's amazing.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.740]   And I said, what?
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.140]   Why are you-- she's like, Derek, don't you remember?
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.060]   You told me this.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.620]   I said, no, I just moved last week.
[00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.540]   She goes, yeah, two years ago, you
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.460]   told me you wanted to move to Woodstock.
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.380]   I said, I did?
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.260]   I don't even remember wanting to move there two years ago.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   She goes, yeah, oh my god, two years ago,
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.060]   you told me you wanted to move to Woodstock.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.780]   You did it.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.500]   That's amazing.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.220]   I went, oh, wow.
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.260]   Wow, I guess I've been wanting this a long time.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.620]   So sometimes I think it goes like that.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.940]   It might take a couple of years for your intention
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.980]   to turn into reality.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.540]   So maybe just accepting that everything
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.180]   doesn't have to move as fast as we expect it to,
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.140]   especially in a professional setting.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.940]   I know you are well-known for saying
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.460]   that you try not to just give your first answer if someone
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.100]   asks you a question, not to just quick, immediately react.
[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.020]   I think maybe we live in a world where that's kind of not
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.860]   the way we default operate.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.020]   So if I'm overwhelmed and I feel like I need to move,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.940]   I don't think, how could I slowly transition my life
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.660]   to be able to move in a year or two?
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.900]   I think, could I move tomorrow?
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.780]   No, I could never move.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.780]   OK, but there are some things in life
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.460]   where doing it tomorrow is the right choice.
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.540]   Here's a more recent example.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.740]   And I know this doesn't sound like a big deal,
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.700]   but I'm living here in New Zealand now,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.060]   and I was missing social interactions.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.180]   New Zealand's quite isolated, and I
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.100]   used to attend a lot of conferences,
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.260]   like whether it was a TED conference or music conferences
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.900]   or tech conferences.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.500]   And I kind of miss having a bunch of new random people
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:40.980]   in my life.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.520]   I kind of miss that thing where you'd
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.940]   go to a conference and meet like 50 people in two days.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.060]   And because I missed that, I was like,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.540]   I'm going to make that happen.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.540]   I'm going to go just do that myself.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.020]   So I booked a trip to India, specifically
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.540]   Chennai and Bangalore, two cities where I know there
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.980]   are a lot of people in my database
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.500]   that I've never met face to face.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.660]   And I sent an email saying, all right,
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.660]   I'm coming to Chennai and Bangalore for 10 days.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.420]   Who should I meet?
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.020]   And used a little scheduling program,
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.340]   and I booked in like nine meetings per day
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.460]   with strangers for six days straight.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.260]   Met with about 55 people, and I just
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.900]   got back a couple of days ago.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.060]   And it was intense and wonderful.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.820]   And I came back, and I was telling a friend about it.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.900]   And she said the same thing that you said.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.900]   I was like, God, you just kind of have an idea,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.420]   and then you just go make it happen.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.220]   That's amazing.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.020]   And yeah, that was a sweet compliment from an old friend.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.940]   And it was kind of funny to hear you just say
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.100]   a version of that right now.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.580]   So I guess this is something like my moving to Woodstock
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.060]   example that I think I've just made it a priority.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.860]   Also, maybe I've always kept my life quite light,
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.940]   meaning I try not to get into situations
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.620]   that bind me to a place.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.420]   I try not to own much stuff.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.180]   So it's just dead easy for me to move.
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.180]   I can pack up my whole house and move in a day.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.640]   That's just been a priority for me.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.860]   But that's not to say that everybody should be like that.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.980]   Some people get deep joy out of having a home with their sofa
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.380]   that they love and their piano and their things.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   And it would be hard for them to move,
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.660]   but that's fine because they get deep joy out
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.340]   of having that deep sense of home
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.140]   and all of these belongings that belonged to their grandparents
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.900]   and all of that.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.700]   I'm not saying everybody should be nomadic,
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.700]   but when you're asking how have I done that, that's my answer.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.820]   I'll go back and say what you did with India
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.180]   was something that I think some people might think, gosh,
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.500]   I really miss all these people.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.220]   I live in a place that's kind of remote.
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.420]   I don't see a lot of people.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.460]   I'm pretty nomadic capable, and I don't own a lot of things.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.020]   Maybe I should move somewhere.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.100]   And you said, no, maybe I'll just take a trip
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.220]   to get that kind of fix, if you will.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.860]   So I want to talk a little bit about how
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.420]   you think about making decisions.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.080]   The decision in someone's mind might be,
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.100]   oh, I'm not able to do what I want.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.900]   Obviously, I need to move somewhere
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.360]   where I can have more of a balance,
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.940]   let the pendulum go back in the middle.
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.060]   And you said, well, maybe there's an alternative.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.340]   Maybe I could go get this deep, intense fix for 10 days
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.420]   that'll hopefully give you a little high
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   of human interaction for a period
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.340]   to come and sustain you.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.020]   When you approach decision making,
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.500]   it sounds like you don't just look
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.020]   at what's the assumed default option of what I could do.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.580]   You try to really make sure you're casting a wide net at
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.400]   ways to experience things.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.240]   - Yes.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.740]   It's one of my favorite things is to be reflective
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.440]   and ask yourself what you really want.
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   And not just limit yourself to a few options
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.260]   from what you see other people doing,
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.640]   but to really kind of dig deep and go,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.620]   like, okay, what do I really want?
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.540]   And why do I want that?
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.120]   What's the real point of that?
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.080]   So if I think I want to be on a beach in Thailand right now,
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.420]   well, why do I think that?
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.260]   What do I really want?
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.940]   What do I expect will happen when I get there?
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.540]   Why is it that I need a beach in Thailand?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.780]   Could it be a beach anywhere?
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.640]   Is it just the quiet that I want?
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.220]   And you may keep asking yourself these questions
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.740]   and get to the actual answer, which is that,
[00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.300]   yeah, my home is too noisy.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.620]   I hate all the clamoring here.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.540]   I live right above a train station or something,
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.140]   and it's too noisy in my home.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.000]   Really what I'm pursuing is the silence.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.740]   Well, do you need to go to Thailand to get silence?
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.500]   Is that the sustainable solution to that?
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.900]   No, maybe I need to soundproof my office.
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.820]   And you might come to, like, yeah,
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.100]   actually I don't need Thailand,
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.420]   but the money it would take to go to Thailand,
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.300]   I could soundproof my office.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   And I really do like living here in Toronto
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.460]   or wherever it is.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.180]   In fact, I'm gonna stay here, not go to Thailand,
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.660]   and soundproof my office.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.260]   Yes, that's what I really want.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.100]   If you keep digging into yourself,
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.620]   you might come out with a solution
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.900]   that suits your problem better.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.980]   - Is there something you do, maybe it's natural for you,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.620]   I have to assume it is,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.380]   where someone asks you a question or you have an idea
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.420]   and you're able to force yourself to pause and think
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.660]   before kind of going all in on this thing.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.060]   Someone says, "Oh, do you wanna go here?"
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.660]   And you're like, and my default is,
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.820]   do I wanna do this thing or not?
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.060]   Not, oh, what are these other options?
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.200]   Someone asks a question, my default is,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.900]   do I know the answer or not?
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.460]   And if I think I know it, let's answer it right away.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.460]   I don't have the natural instinct to pause and think before.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.900]   And I'm curious, is there something
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.460]   that you've trained yourself to do?
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.680]   Is it natural?
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.500]   Have you thought about how people
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.500]   who maybe don't have that instinct could adopt it?
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.940]   I think it would be beneficial to me,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.780]   which is why I'm asking.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.300]   - Well, I journal like crazy.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.140]   - Okay.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.660]   - I journal so much.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.780]   Unlike the other things where I say,
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.580]   "Hey, you know, not everybody has to do this.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.380]   Everybody has to do this.
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.700]   Everybody should do this."
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.220]   It helps so much to pause,
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.580]   and it doesn't even matter what,
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:58.460]   pen, paper, text file, Google Docs, doesn't matter.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.460]   Something where you can stop like every day
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.260]   and ask yourself these reflective questions.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.020]   Like ask yourself questions like,
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.100]   why am I doing this?
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.840]   And what am I really after?
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.460]   What's the point of that?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.980]   And then you should doubt yourself.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.340]   You should doubt the answers you give yourself.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.740]   So even if you say, "Why do I want this?
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.700]   Because I've always wanted to go to Thailand."
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.940]   Challenge yourself, right?
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.100]   Really, have I always wanted to go to Thailand?
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.220]   Really, always?
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.300]   Why do I think that Thailand is the answer?
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.140]   Like push back on your own answers.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.460]   And it can take just an hour of your day.
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.140]   And it is so, so useful.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.700]   And if you say that I don't have an hour in the day,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.200]   well, the hell you don't.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.400]   You know, like turn off other things and do this
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.280]   because where it takes you
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.280]   makes all the difference in the world.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.540]   - And are there prompts that you use
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.080]   or is it just whatever's happening in the day?
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.120]   - Yeah, whatever's happening.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.280]   Not like generic prompts that I'm gonna, you know,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.120]   "Hey everybody, write down these five questions
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.160]   to ask yourself every day."
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.000]   No, it's not like that.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.280]   It's just based on whatever your situation is in the moment.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.640]   Generally, I think use it to clarify your thinking
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.100]   and to think of other options.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.520]   Like you said, like if you think you have no choice,
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.360]   you're always wrong.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.700]   There's always another choice.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.480]   If you think you've only got two choices,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.660]   well, those aren't options.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.760]   That's a dilemma.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.720]   If you think you only have two choices,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.480]   you still haven't thought enough.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.480]   You have to keep thinking of other options.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.880]   You can always add some crazy ones in there.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.960]   Like, okay, option number three,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.040]   I quit everything and join a monastery.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.400]   Okay, option number four,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.760]   I go down to my local park and I lay on the bench
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.400]   and I don't leave, I become homeless.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.040]   Okay, well now you've added two more options
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.860]   that you don't like.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.400]   You can always keep going and then get more creative.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   Do the brainstorming approach
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   where you're deliberately thinking of out of the box,
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.240]   crazy solutions for your situation,
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.000]   but just keep going until you've got like 10 or 20 options.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.440]   And many of my best ideas in life,
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.320]   the ones that I've been the happiest with,
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.380]   the choices I've made have come from this pushing myself
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.480]   to further solutions, right?
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.300]   It was actually like solution number 18
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.520]   that got me the most excited and that's the one I pursued.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.100]   - Is there an example of, I thought I was gonna do this
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.960]   and this new thing came out
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.920]   that I never was thinking about originally?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.760]   - Ooh, yeah, what's an example?
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.840]   Well, like actually that trip to India that I just took,
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.600]   that came far down the list.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600]   At first it was like,
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.960]   I think I need to go to the TED conference again,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.480]   which I haven't been to in 10 years.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   Then it was like,
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.280]   well, I think I just need to go to any conference.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.000]   And then it was like,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.900]   what about a local class here in Wellington, New Zealand,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.740]   where I live?
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.700]   Maybe I can find like a philosophy course here
[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.060]   so I can meet other interesting people
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.660]   that are into this kind of stuff I'm into.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.700]   And then it was like, oh, I could go traveling.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.100]   I could go travel Europe.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.380]   And I just kept going.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.140]   And then yeah, way down the list was like,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.140]   I could go to India.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.340]   That was like, oh, India, yes.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.120]   Oh my God, I haven't been to India in 12 years.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.060]   I know so many people in India.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.260]   And through a weird thing that I married a woman from India,
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.340]   I'm a citizen of India.
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.620]   I have the legal right to live in India
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.700]   for the rest of my life.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.380]   I was like, ooh, see, this one works for me on many levels
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.940]   because this wouldn't just be a travel.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.840]   This wouldn't just be a trip.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.620]   This is like an investment into my future.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.380]   Like it's likely I will live there someday.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.700]   And so getting to know it better now,
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.700]   meeting people now would be an investment
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.220]   into future long-term friendships,
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.140]   not just a quick romp at a conference.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.160]   So yeah, that came way down the list.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.120]   And that's one example.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.680]   And again, I just got back from this trip,
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.840]   so it's on my mind right now,
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.600]   but I met so many interesting people there
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.400]   and had so many fascinating conversations.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.140]   It was just what I needed.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.480]   And yeah, that solution did not come
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.440]   until I had really spent an hour in my journal
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.320]   thinking of different solutions.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.160]   - I love it.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.280]   I'm gonna propose for people who might be like me
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.200]   thinking, gosh, journaling, I wanna try,
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.240]   but I'm not sure what.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.040]   What I hear is take some decision
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.500]   you're thinking about making
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.820]   and maybe just spend an hour by yourself
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.780]   with a notebook, a pen, not a computer,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.380]   and just kind of think of different ways
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.380]   that you could have a different outcome.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.280]   Instead of journaling, I'm gonna call it brainstorming
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.300]   'cause I think we might be more familiar
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.220]   with how to start doing that.
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.040]   But at the end of the day,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.880]   it's just writing things down and thinking about them.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.740]   So you can call it whatever you want.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.860]   But I like this idea.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.640]   I'm not a disciplined journaling person,
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.300]   but I feel like I'm gonna try to take your advice after this
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.600]   and at least commit to it.
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.780]   - I'm not disciplined either about it.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.980]   It is absolutely not a discipline.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.140]   To me, it's just sanity.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.220]   It's like I've been doing this since I was a teenager
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.700]   and I'm 53 now.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.220]   So almost every day I hit some point
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.120]   where I need to clarify my thoughts on something.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.260]   What might even be about somebody,
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.560]   like somebody's pissed you off
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.880]   and you find that you're all upset.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.620]   You need to kind of stop and clarify your thoughts.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.640]   Instead of just sitting there and feeling angry,
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.480]   you're like, wait, why am I feeling angry?
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480]   What's this really about?
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.000]   And so instead of just sitting there on your sofa stewing,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.400]   it's just like open your thing, whatever it is,
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.600]   your paper notebook or in my case,
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.480]   I just use a plain text file.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.920]   I just open up a plain text file and I just start typing.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.360]   There's no discipline to it at all.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.280]   It's just like, what the hell?
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.480]   I am so angry right now.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.980]   Why am I angry?
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.520]   Because this person did that thing.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.360]   Well, so what?
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.240]   Why does that matter?
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.280]   Well, because this,
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.360]   and I'll just kind of have this dialogue with myself,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.520]   like I said, and like kind of challenging and pushing back.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.200]   I hear that, I don't know much about this,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.380]   but I've heard that this is similar
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.720]   to something called cognitive behavioral therapy.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.060]   And it is known to be one of the few things
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:54.880]   that works for people with depression or anxiety
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.400]   or other major life problems.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.660]   Cognitive behavioral therapy works wonders.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.600]   I heard that a couple of times.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.000]   And when I just looked into what it is,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.200]   it sounds like it's what I've been doing in my journal
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.240]   since I was a teenager.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   So I could say it in my very undisciplined way
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.080]   that it's worked wonders for me.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.200]   And most of the major life decisions that I've made
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.480]   have come from that process.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.760]   - It sounds a little bit also like rubber duck debugging.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.680]   I don't know if you're familiar as a way to make decisions.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.720]   You know, I think you wrote a post about
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   getting mentors advice
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.160]   without actually ever speaking with them.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.000]   - I don't know about you,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.840]   but I'm using the new year as an excuse
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.920]   to get fitness back in my routine.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.080]   And if you're gonna work out,
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.440]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.960]   which I think is Viore,
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.840]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.280]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.280]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.660]   but doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.360]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.220]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.200]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.680]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.120]   And it's not just for men.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.640]   My wife, Amy, is just as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.580]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.560]   I have a few pairs,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.440]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.720]   I've ever owned.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.880]   I also love my Core Shorts and Strato Tech Tees.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   Their products are incredibly versatile,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.240]   and they could be used for just about any activity,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.560]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.680]   but they're also great for lounging,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.000]   running around town, or their Meta Pants
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.920]   can even work for a night out.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.960]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.280]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.880]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,

[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.380]   As a parent, your top priority
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.680]   is always your children's wellbeing.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.080]   You wanna give them everything they need to grow and thrive,
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.760]   both now and in the future,
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.760]   which is why I'm excited to partner with Fabric
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.720]   by Gerber Life for this episode.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.560]   With term life insurance from Fabric,
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   you can help protect your family
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.400]   so their future is secure no matter what happens.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.600]   Fabric was designed by parents for parents
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.400]   to help you get a high quality,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.280]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.880]   in less than 10 minutes.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.640]   And when I say surprisingly affordable,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.800]   I actually went online to compare prices,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.160]   and I found Fabric to be highly competitive

[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.280]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Insurance Company,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.000]   not available in certain states,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.520]   prices subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.600]   - Should we tell the listeners quickly,
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.080]   so the rubber ducking comes from,
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.400]   first it's from back in the day
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.880]   when people had those big monitors,
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.960]   the big CRT monitors on their desktop computers.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.240]   - That you could actually put something on top.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.760]   - Yeah, where you could put things on top.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.880]   And so, computer programmers started a habit
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.680]   of putting a little rubber duck on top of their monitor,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.440]   and whenever they were trying to get work
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.400]   through a programming problem where they're stuck,
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.280]   it was like, okay, tell the duck.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.440]   And so you'd say to the duck,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.360]   like, the reason I'm stuck is because I can't figure this.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.120]   Well then, why can't you figure out that?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.600]   Because what I'm trying to get is the instances table
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.000]   to match with the something table.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.240]   Well, why can't you do that?
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.840]   Because it's, and so yeah, explain it to the rubber duck
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   and it'll help you clarify your thoughts.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.360]   Yeah, so that's definitely what I'm doing in my journal.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   Then changing the subject, you said the mentors,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.200]   that yeah, I often, when journaling, I'll ask myself,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.880]   like, what would Seth Godin say?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.280]   Like, he's a hero of mine, and he's such a wise guy
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.400]   beyond his marketing that he talks about.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.560]   He's just wise in general.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.280]   Like, his approach to life is very thoughtful and measured.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.360]   And he's a friend that I could call,
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.040]   but before calling him, I ask myself,
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   if I were to call Seth right now,
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.560]   what would he probably say?
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.920]   Like, I know what he would say.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.440]   He would say this, and I'd like write that.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   And then that ends up helping me get to a good solution
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.720]   for myself without ever having to bother Seth Godin.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.280]   So yeah, I wrote a post about that,
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   like how to ask your mentors for help
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.120]   or something like that.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.600]   And I just basically described this process,
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.040]   like ask yourself what the mentors would say.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:46.880]   - I love it.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.320]   I'll try to find all the links to everything we talk about,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   put it in the show notes so people can find it.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.440]   I met someone once,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.520]   and I offered to help them with a challenge.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.640]   And they said, no, no, no, I don't want your help yet.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.480]   I have a rule.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.440]   I try to spend 15 minutes at least on my own
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.680]   trying to solve something
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.120]   before I ask for anyone to spend their time to help me out.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.480]   And I was like, oh, wow.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.520]   To use one of your phrases,
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.960]   this person is making it easy for me to say no on my own.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.480]   And so it's something I've tried to do in my own life
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.440]   is I feel like plenty of us are overwhelmed.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.760]   We have lots of stuff going on,
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.280]   and we could talk in a bit about how to slow down
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.920]   and say no and only focus on the things you care about.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.200]   But one way that I can kind of contribute to the problem
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.840]   or relieving the problem
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.400]   is just trying not to ask everyone to help me out
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.360]   until I've tried to do some work on my own.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   And my snarky reply to close friends
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.040]   and family members for years
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.720]   was always the let me Google that for you site
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.600]   if you've ever been there,
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.040]   which was someone texts you
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.640]   and they're like, do you know a good Italian restaurant
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.480]   in Dallas?
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.840]   And I'm like, yeah, Italian restaurant.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.560]   Like you could just search for these things.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.760]   I've never even been to Dallas.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.880]   Now I'm hoping that the world will slowly adopt a practice
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.000]   of trying to do a little bit of homework
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.480]   before asking people.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.920]   'Cause it's easy for me to text back my sister or my mom.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.240]   Hey, why don't you do a Google search before asking?
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.960]   It's much harder to text a stranger
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.840]   or a business acquaintance back and be like,
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.720]   hey, could you actually just try before emailing me?
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.920]   But there were a couple of things we talked about
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.080]   that I wanna loop back to.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.760]   So it's gonna be a bit of a zigzag conversation.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.480]   Journaling allows you to come up with lots of options.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.040]   You talked about decision-making.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.080]   If there's one option, it's not true.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.360]   If there's two, it's a dilemma,
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.520]   but you wanna get to a place where there's a lot.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.960]   One of the challenges I have,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.560]   and I think a lot of people listening have
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.400]   is actually on the other direction,
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   which is getting into this analysis paralysis.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.680]   So a few weeks ago, I did an episode about insurance
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.840]   and I went down this crazy rabbit hole
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.560]   of how do I get the best homeowners
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.200]   and auto and umbrella policies for my life,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   which led to, oh, there's all these carriers.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.680]   I should go get a quote from all of them
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.280]   and I should analyze all these details.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.120]   And believe me, I did not have a dilemma or a A or B.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.320]   It was like, there weren't enough letters in the alphabet
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.640]   to define the option set I had.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.520]   And then you're like, oh, well, if I go with this one,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.640]   it's a little bit more expensive,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.520]   but if our SUV breaks down,
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.040]   they guarantee that I could rent an SUV
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.440]   instead of just an economy car.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.360]   But this other one offers this other feature.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.720]   And for me, it was a struggle.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.440]   I searched to see if you'd written about this
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.280]   because I was like, ah,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.720]   I know someone who might have some advice.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   Then I tried to think about what would Derek say
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.840]   and I couldn't really come up with it.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.560]   So I'll just ask you,
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.520]   how would you suggest people think about making decisions
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.400]   when there are too many options and they're struggling?
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   - Oof, for me, one option usually leaps out
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.200]   as the one that makes me feel the best.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.640]   And it's not always rational and that's okay.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.800]   And then if it doesn't,
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.040]   I just pick one that seems to rationally work.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.120]   And then it's a mindset of that picking anything
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.360]   is better than picking nothing.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.320]   If it's something that you have to pick.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.920]   Okay, so wait, what do I mean by that?
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.120]   There's a great value in launching.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.400]   For example, I've met some people
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.280]   that have been working on their book for so long
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.320]   without launching it, without calling it complete,
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.800]   that they're reaping none of the benefits
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.400]   of having the book out there in the public, right?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.560]   So at some point with anything you're creating,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.280]   whether it's a blog post or a decision,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.120]   you realize, all right,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.160]   well, I just have to finish this thing.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.400]   I have to finish this choice.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.960]   I have to finish this article that I'm working on.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   And once you put great value onto finishing or deciding,
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.480]   then what you do is you just get into a different mindset
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.920]   about the benefit of putting it out there,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.160]   the benefit of finishing.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.440]   Like say, you can make any choice great
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.560]   through just deciding to make the best of it.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.200]   Okay, but wait, sorry, that answer was a little mushy.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.800]   - Related to this insurance thing,
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.160]   I'm looking back and I'm thinking there were two moments
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.600]   where I could have done what you suggested
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.880]   that would have made it a lot faster
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.240]   and I probably would have felt a lot better.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.360]   One was for some reason,
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.840]   and I can't really explain why,
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.300]   maybe it's the positive reviews,
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.400]   maybe it's the word of mouth,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.680]   the consumer reports rating,
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.800]   just felt like USAA as an insurance carrier
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.920]   was where I kinda just wanted to end up.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.980]   Every time I was about to hit the recalculate button,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.880]   I was like, come on, just be really competitive
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.920]   so I can just be done with this.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.680]   So one answer was, if you have that feeling,
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.720]   just own it and be like,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.240]   yeah, it might be a little more expensive,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.200]   let's move forward.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.440]   That was one.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.400]   The alternative version, let's say you don't have that,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   is, well, right now, the problem was that
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.700]   we were using one carrier
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.880]   and they just couldn't continue to insure the house
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.400]   because the house had kind of appreciated
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.520]   and it wasn't a good fit,
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.840]   so we needed to move carriers.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.480]   Instead of making it about the big decision
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.560]   of we have to have a new insurance carrier,
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.320]   so this is not a do I need this or not,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.980]   we absolutely need this.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.680]   But instead of trying to find the best possible thing,
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.960]   I could have picked the first carrier
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.760]   that could do what we needed
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.640]   and put that policy into place,
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.420]   be done with the policy that I have now
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.040]   that I know is not good,
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.440]   and then decided, okay,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.060]   is it worth continuing to evaluate the landscape?
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.920]   Because what I was doing was I actually had two problems.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.200]   I had, I have something that doesn't work
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.780]   and I need something that works,
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.920]   and I'm also interested in finding the best thing.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.680]   And because I was solving them both at the same time,
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.360]   I was actually delaying getting the thing in place
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.720]   that I needed to do more urgently.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.280]   And if I had just picked anything,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.960]   it might've been more expensive,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.200]   but I would have been done with problem A,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.600]   and I probably could have said,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.120]   is it really worth trying to solve problem B right now?
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.520]   But when I put the two problems together,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.920]   I made it seem like they were equally as important.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.440]   So if you could just pick anything that is good
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.260]   and then decide whether you wanna go on the quest for great
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.680]   or go on to another quest for good in your life,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.620]   I don't know.
[00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:50.920]   That's me trying to philosophize your feedback,
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.320]   but I could have completely butchered it.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.480]   - No, you nailed it.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   That was wonderful.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.920]   All right, Chris, I've got three topics
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.520]   you just brought up.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.360]   - Okay.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.600]   - I'm gonna name them first
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   so we can remember to come back to them.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.180]   Number one, the coin toss.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.120]   Number two, the paradox of choice.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.280]   Number three, theory versus practice.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.920]   Okay, coin toss.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.320]   The reason to flip a coin when you're making a decision
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.920]   is not to let the heads or the tails actually decide it,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.000]   it's to notice how you feel when the coin is in the air.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.880]   Like you just said about USAA.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.540]   If you were to do the coin toss with USAA,
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.760]   you would have been like, "Oh, please land on USAA."
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.720]   And as soon as you notice that feeling in yourself,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.840]   it's like, "Okay, I think I've just decided."
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.160]   It isn't actually the coin that decides,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.400]   it's the pressure of that like, "Oh God, here it comes.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.020]   Here's the final decision."
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.400]   And then you notice which one
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   you're actually leaning towards.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.920]   Okay, that is to be valued because emotions matter.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.680]   I've sometimes chosen, say like,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.240]   the more expensive internet service provider
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.800]   because I think they're more ethical or they're cooler
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.840]   and I just feel better about giving my money to that company
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.120]   even though it's more expensive than the other choice.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.880]   Okay, so that's the coin toss.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.480]   - I'm like thinking with the coin toss,
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.120]   I'm like, I wanna create this rule around it
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:16.600]   where I have to commit to the decision
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.920]   of whatever lands on the coin toss
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:22.160]   unless I stop at midair and decide.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.680]   So it's like, I can flip the coin
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.000]   and if my gut says what it is,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.360]   I can grab it out of midair and say,
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.960]   "Done, I don't have to abide by the rule, I've decided."
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.400]   I wonder if it loses its value
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.080]   if you don't commit to it being a decider.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.440]   If I just say, "Let's flip a coin and see how my gut feels."
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.800]   I feel like the first few times, maybe it'll work.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   By the end, I'm like,
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.360]   "Well, now I just know I'm just flipping a coin."
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.320]   I'm trying to think of ways
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.760]   to make the coin toss higher stakes.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.200]   So it forces that kind of deep-rooted gut instinct
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.080]   out faster.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.200]   - Well, it's a fun idea.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.040]   I disagree.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.640]   I think you should always go ultimately
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.840]   with the one that makes you feel the best.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.360]   Your emotions matter, your feelings matter.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.640]   You need to feel good about the choices you've made in life.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.880]   You can't find yourself working at a job
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.640]   and every day for eight hours a day
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.960]   going somewhere where you're like,
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   "Ugh, yeah, it's the right choice."
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.480]   (laughs)
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.600]   The coin said, "Here I am, damn it."
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.440]   - Fair.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.720]   - So you've got to feel good about your choices.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   You can add rational reasons later,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.360]   but the feelings are harder to adapt.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.440]   Sometimes it's the reverse.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   Sometimes you make a choice because it's the right thing.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.040]   Okay, so "Paradox of Choice."
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.160]   There's a wonderful book about this thing.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.560]   You said that you were looking to my site
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.280]   to see if I'd written about this.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   You need to look to the book called
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.640]   "Paradox of Choice" by Barry Schwartz.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.440]   S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.200]   Brilliant masterpiece of a book about exactly this,
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.080]   about having too many options and what do you do.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.400]   And the gist, if you had to narrow the book down
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   to a few sentences is that when we consider every option,
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.200]   we may technically make a better choice,
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.480]   but we will feel worse about it
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.080]   because we're too aware of all of the other choices
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.760]   we could have made.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.520]   So the advice, and let me pause to say,
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.760]   the advice which is coming from a PhD psychologist
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.560]   who has been studying the science of decision-making
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.840]   for many, many, many years,
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.280]   the advice after all of his studies and research
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.520]   into the subject is that we should choose to satisfice,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.040]   not maximize.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.760]   He said, "People, when they're making decisions
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.040]   "are either satisficing or maximizing."
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.840]   So maximizing is what you were just doing
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.640]   with the insurance where you dive deep down the rabbit hole
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.400]   and you look deeply into every option
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.520]   and you really kind of kill yourself over it
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   and you maximize to make the best possible decision.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.400]   Satisficing is in short, it's saying good enough.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.880]   It's like, I need a new insurance policy.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.640]   I'm gonna give myself one hour to pick a new one.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.040]   You look at some options, you're like,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.320]   okay, I'm picking this, good enough.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.840]   So what he said is that people who satisfies
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.520]   feel much better about the decision they make
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.040]   psychologically, the way our brains work.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.360]   We feel better when we've just make a decision,
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.440]   stick with it and don't try
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.080]   to make the best possible decision.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.920]   - What about people who love,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.560]   like get intense joy out of that process?
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.120]   'Cause I think that's the crazy thing is
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.720]   when I was going through this,
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.520]   my wife was like, "You have a lot of stuff to do.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.880]   Why are you still researching insurance?"
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.720]   And I was like, "I don't know, I built a new table.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.640]   I built a new comparison matrix."
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.720]   And I was loving it.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.760]   And what was going through my head
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.040]   wasn't the $500 a year I'd save.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.080]   And I don't even know if it was the joy
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.560]   of knowing I made the best outcome.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.160]   You mentioned earlier following
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.200]   your kind of intellectual curiosity.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:57.920]   And I was just generally very excited
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.160]   to understand the nuance of this whole space.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.400]   I get a lot of joy knowing
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.640]   that someone could ask me about it.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.120]   I could give them a recommendation.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:09.120]   And I'm very jealous when someone says,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.760]   "Hey, I'm thinking about this thing."
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.240]   And I'm like, "Oh, I did all this research.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.080]   This is what I said."
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.920]   They're like, "Great, I'll do that."
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.160]   I'm like, "That's all you need?
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:17.240]   You just needed me to talk for one sentence
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.040]   and now you're done and you made a decision?"
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.720]   And I'm very jealous of those people, but I do enjoy it.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.680]   It's not totally wasted time
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.480]   if you enjoy the process, fair?
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.960]   - Right.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.040]   Yeah, see, it's funny.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.520]   You're talking about something different
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.440]   that I think was not included in that book,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   which is the benefit of kind of you taking one for the team.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.400]   Like you doing the hard work so that others don't have to
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.320]   and getting like a deeper kind of community joy
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.680]   from how much you're sharing.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.800]   Yeah, it's wonderful that people like you
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.960]   do all the hard work like that every now and then
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.400]   and dive down those rabbit holes.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.280]   So people like the rest of us can just say,
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.120]   "I need new..."
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.240]   Well, Chris already figured it out.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.480]   So hold on, let me just see.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.880]   All right, Chris chose this.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.960]   All right, I'm just choosing that.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.520]   There, problem done.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.640]   It's like, because you maximized, we can satisfy.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.440]   You know, we can say, "All right, I'll let him choose."
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.600]   I do that so many times in life with, say,
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.400]   would you say the best Italian restaurant in Dallas?
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.240]   That I'll just look, "Okay, what did somebody else say?
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.520]   Oh, look, somebody's done an article
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.000]   about the seven best Italian restaurants in Dallas.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.840]   Which do they choose?
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.480]   All right, I'm just gonna go to that one then."
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.320]   Problem solved.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.080]   When I moved to Los Angeles years ago,
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.840]   I'd never really been to Los Angeles,
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.000]   but my girlfriend at the time
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.640]   had just signed up for film school down there.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:38.720]   I was like, "I'm gonna go with her."
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.080]   So I emailed 10 people I knew that lived in LA,
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.960]   and I said, "Hey, what neighborhood should I live in?"
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.120]   And everybody had different answers,
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:51.840]   but Santa Monica was on nine out of the 10 people's lists.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.000]   They'd say, "Oh, you know, Palisades,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.440]   whatever, Pasadena, Santa Monica."
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.520]   Somebody else would say, "Venice, Santa Monica, Century City."
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   But Santa Monica was on everybody's list,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.040]   so I didn't even look at any other options.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.880]   I just went straight to Santa Monica,
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.080]   went to the real estate office there,
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.000]   and just said, "What do you got?"
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.200]   And I didn't look anywhere else
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.960]   because I deferred to my friends' choices.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.920]   So yeah, other people did the hard work
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.160]   of living there for years
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.600]   and discovering every neighborhood
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.080]   and learning the hard way.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.680]   I just took the benefit of their work.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   So yes, you diving down your rabbit hole
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.080]   and benefiting the rest of the world
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.160]   by doing so is great.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.800]   And I love just using other people's work for that.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.280]   But also, you were having fun.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.520]   You say that you were sweating it,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.960]   but part of you was just enjoying it.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.600]   You're like, "This is fascinating.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.360]   Oh my God, look at all these different options.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.240]   I'm gonna make a grid.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.880]   This is giving me some kind of joy
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.440]   to lay out all my options in a spreadsheet
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.360]   and find out about this.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.120]   And wow, this is fascinating."
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.400]   Like, "This one won't give you an SUV replacement.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.720]   They'll just give you a car.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.760]   This one won't do this.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.720]   Wow, there are so many parameters here
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.400]   I hadn't noticed before."
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.280]   So computer programmers do this a lot, of course,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.560]   when you're looking for a tech solution to something.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.800]   And you look out to the world of open source software
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.080]   and you're like, "Okay, oh my God,
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.320]   there are like nine different calendar apps
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   that I could use.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   Okay, let me dive into the pros and cons of each one."
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.200]   And then you might find this less popular one
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.440]   that serves your needs exactly.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.600]   But boy, it was kind of interesting
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.000]   to learn about all the different features
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.560]   that you hadn't even considered in these.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.480]   And we might just enjoy that process.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.480]   And somebody might say it's a stupid use of your time,
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.600]   but if you're finding it fascinating,
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.560]   well, then you're kind of like choosing this
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.760]   over watching a movie, right?
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.960]   Like other people would just sit there
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.640]   and stare at a TV screen.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.200]   You're engaging with the world
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.280]   and getting entertainment out of doing this.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.000]   And lastly, my example that I got made fun of a lot for
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.320]   was when I was running my company, CD Baby, for 10 years,
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.000]   I was the 100% owner, I was the CEO.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.640]   And yet whenever we needed a new computer for the office,
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.960]   which happened about 50 times,
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.280]   I had 85 employees and we had about 50 computers
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.560]   in the office, I would build the computer myself.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.960]   I would go down to the electronics store,
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.640]   get the motherboard, pick out the CPU, the graphics card,
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.560]   the hard drive, the case, the power supply.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.200]   And I would thoroughly enjoy being in the office at night
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.880]   after everybody had left,
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   building a computer while listening to music.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.160]   And once it was all put together,
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.920]   I would install Linux onto it and get it working.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.440]   And then the morning I'd set it up at somebody's desk
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.440]   and like, "Ah, that was fun."
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.280]   And somebody teased me years later saying sarcastically,
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.120]   like, "Yeah, that was a good use of the CEO's time."
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.040]   And I said, "It fucking was, it was a great use of my time
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.960]   because I loved doing it."
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.160]   Like, I wouldn't want to outsource that joy to somebody else.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.800]   Like, I really loved those evenings at the office,
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.880]   putting a computer together.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.720]   I find it very peaceful.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   Some people do crossword puzzles for that same joy, right?
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.640]   You don't outsource the crossword puzzle
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.440]   to have somebody else solve it for you.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.640]   You do it yourself 'cause you enjoy it.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.960]   - I think it's a message that we probably haven't shared
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.480]   enough in this show,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:13.360]   is that if you really enjoy that process,
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.400]   sometimes it's stressful.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.480]   I've had moments where I'm like an hour
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.560]   into comparing the distribution of one to five ratings
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.440]   on Korean restaurants in LA,
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.840]   and I should have stopped and flipped a coin.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.720]   It wouldn't have mattered.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.240]   And sometimes I think it's too much,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   but there are times where it's really enjoyable.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.040]   And even when it's a lot, it can be fun.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.840]   And I like the fact that you've been able to prioritize
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.440]   pursuing things that make you happy
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.800]   and that you enjoy and stimulate you intellectually.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.440]   And I think we probably don't do that enough
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.120]   as an average person in society.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:42.960]   - Hey, wait, Chris.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   So remember when I like named those three things,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.360]   the coin toss, the paradox of choice,
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.200]   there was a third one.
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.040]   - Theory versus practice.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.360]   - Yes, we haven't done that yet.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.360]   So many times I've found myself in my journal thinking,
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.600]   maybe this, maybe that.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.280]   And you realize there's so many things in life
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.560]   that in theory sound good,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.600]   but in practice are not or vice versa.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.400]   And so I've learned the hard way
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.320]   that you have to just try these things.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.200]   You have to just go do it.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.640]   And it even comes with choices
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   like yours about insurance.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.120]   I'm really glad that you gave that example
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.440]   of like, maybe I'll just pick one now
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.520]   just to get out of my situation.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.520]   And then if I don't like it, I'll change again.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.120]   That to me is a beautiful little example
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   of trying something in practice instead of just in theory.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   So there have been a major life decisions I've made,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.160]   like moving here to New Zealand.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.080]   That came from the similar kind of dilemma.
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.680]   I was sitting in Singapore with my ex who said,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.880]   "I hate it here."
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.320]   And I was like, "Okay, so where else can we go?
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.280]   New Zealand seems nice.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.400]   We've never actually lived there,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.800]   but it seems like a nice place to be.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.120]   Like, let's try it.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.320]   Like, we'll never know what New Zealand is like
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.720]   unless we just try it."
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.840]   And it took a few months of paperwork to become a resident
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.840]   in order to stay long enough to really try living here.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.880]   But you have to do these things in practice,
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.480]   not just in theory, just to see what it's really like
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.680]   with the understanding that I'm still just trying it.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.240]   This isn't like a final decision.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.800]   This is still just, I'm going to try this option,
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   but I need to try it in practice, not just in theory.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.400]   - Has that changed?
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.720]   You talk about moving and living different places.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.400]   You have a family or you have a child.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.880]   How does that affect your ability
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.160]   to live this kind of nomadic lifestyle
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.200]   or put these theories into practice, or has it not?
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.040]   - It has.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.040]   We let the tangent go earlier,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.720]   but you said something about the fact that I went to India
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.560]   for only 10 days instead of deciding to move there.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.440]   Dude, if my kid wasn't in school in New Zealand right now,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.720]   and if his mother didn't work for the New Zealand government
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.560]   and needs to be here, I would be living in India right now.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.080]   I loved that trip so much.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.880]   I just wanted to cancel my return flight home.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.400]   I met so many wonderful people there.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.680]   It was one of those moments in my life,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.480]   and I've had a few of these, where you go somewhere
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.160]   and it's just like everything in you is just a yes.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.640]   You're like, "Oh my God, yes, this is where I need to be."
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.280]   And so a few times in my life, I've done this,
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.480]   where I just was visiting somewhere
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.680]   and I just canceled my return flight and stayed.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.920]   I was living in Santa Monica, California,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.160]   when I went to New York City for a friend's wedding,
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.080]   and it was a three-day trip.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.880]   And I went there with just basically three days of clothes,
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.760]   attended the wedding, but just something about
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.480]   getting out of the train in Penn Station
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.080]   and walking out into Manhattan,
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.800]   and it was like, "Grrr," the energy of the place.
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.440]   I was just like, "Oh hell yeah,
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.280]   this is what I need right now."
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.640]   I was like, "I could fly back to Santa Monica
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.840]   to get my clothes, but that would put a lot of pollution
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.040]   into the air, and I think my clothes
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:48.960]   aren't even worth that much."
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.840]   So I just canceled my return flight
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.200]   and bought some new clothes and stayed,
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.640]   and I lived in New York for a year.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.560]   And so yeah, I just had that moment last week in India
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.760]   of just like, "Damn, I just wanna stay here.
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.240]   This is where I need to be now."
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.320]   But yeah, I've got a kid who's 11 and in school now,
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.000]   and his mom works for the government, and here we are.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.920]   So instead, I'm just going to use that restriction
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.400]   in my life, that creative restriction to work within that.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.040]   So I'll just go visit more often.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:16.440]   - There's been so much talk lately about AI,
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:18.840]   and I love playing around with chat GPT,
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.200]   but the AI tool I actually use most is Notion AI,
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.880]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.400]   As I've said many times, I literally use Notion every day
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.800]   for notes, trip planning, managing our family,
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.240]   and most importantly, running this podcast.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:35.760]   It's definitely one of my all-time favorite tools,
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.120]   and it only got better with Notion AI,
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.320]   which can help you automate tedious tasks
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.960]   and streamline your workflow.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.840]   For example, you can save time and write faster
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.040]   by letting Notion AI handle the brainstorm and first draft,
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.440]   or turn messy notes into something really polished.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.120]   I've been using it for the past few months,
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.480]   and it's blown my mind on multiple occasions.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.320]   In fact, when I was trying to explain homeowner's insurance,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.760]   I just asked Notion AI to, quote,
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.240]   "Write a paragraph overview
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.200]   of what homeowner's insurance is for," and boom.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.120]   I could tell you firsthand that Notion AI
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.800]   helps you work faster, write better, think bigger,
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.480]   and do tasks that normally take you hours in just seconds.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.200]   And the best part, for a limited time,
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.440]   try Notion AI for free when you go to

[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.160]   It is astonishing how much of our personal information
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.400]   is online, and in the last few months,
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.000]   I've been trying to remove as much of Amy
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.120]   and my info as possible.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.000]   I also did the same for our parents,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.160]   and in total, after reviewing over 20,000 listings,
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   we found over 1,000 pieces
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.440]   of personally identifiable information.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.400]   Thankfully, it's all getting removed,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.600]   and instead of spending 50-plus hours
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.920]   searching and filing requests to do that,
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.440]   it only took a few minutes
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.480]   because I used Delete.me from ABINE,
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.280]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.520]   with them for this episode.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.320]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.600]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.400]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.760]   but they'll continuously scan for new data
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.160]   that shows up and get that removed as well.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.080]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.460]   over 2,000 pieces of data for a customer
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.960]   in their first two years,
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:34.440]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.800]   of data for their customers.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.360]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.340]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.360]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.900]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.860]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.620]   I just wanna thank you, Quick,

[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.540]   So I wanna come back to parenting at some point.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.480]   A lot of these tangents,
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.100]   you said something earlier about heroes,
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.340]   and I know you have some perspective
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:21.020]   on how thinking about heroes can be valuable
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.460]   to thinking about what you wanna do.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.020]   Maybe we could touch on that a little
[00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.700]   because I think it kind of ties together,
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.580]   who are we, what do we care about,
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.000]   what do we wanna do with our lives and our careers?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:32.840]   How do you think about that?
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.180]   You're in a place where you've both had success,
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:38.300]   it's given you a lot of creative flexibility
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.240]   with work and life and where you live.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.700]   Maybe not everyone has that,
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.380]   maybe people need to work towards that,
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.080]   but you've been fortunate to find the thing you love doing,
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.980]   and I don't think it was the thing you always thought.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.940]   You've said that you feel like
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.980]   you most associate with a writer now,
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.260]   but I don't think it started like that.
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.020]   You didn't know that for many years.
[00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.180]   How did you come to that,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:58.900]   and how might you have come to that sooner
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.140]   with the wisdom you have now?
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:01.020]   - Well, it's funny.
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.300]   People sometimes say, "Oh, well, dude, you're lucky.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:06.460]   "You can just get up and go."
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.820]   I'm like, "But that's not luck.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.640]   "That was, the life I'm living is the culmination
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.340]   "of like 180 little decisions along the way
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.800]   "since I was a teenager."
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.020]   Like at every little point,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:20.640]   starting from when I was like 17 years old,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.220]   I over and over again made the choice
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.540]   that gave me more freedom
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.780]   because I knew this was important to me.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.040]   So even if I was, say, like offered a job
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.420]   that was going to pay more but give me less freedom,
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.100]   I said, "No, I chose the choice with more freedom
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.680]   "even though it paid less money.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.840]   "I chose the romantic partner
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.660]   "that also wanted to travel the world
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.260]   "instead of getting romantically tangled
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.700]   "with somebody who is bound to living next door
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.580]   "to her parents."
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.700]   Even when I set up my company,
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.420]   the way that I set up like the organization
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.840]   and how it was run,
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.720]   I chose the choice that would give me more freedom.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:56.060]   And God, so many things.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.980]   Even like when I decided to sell my company,
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:01.780]   my number one criteria was like,
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.120]   "This is gonna be a cash sale.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:04.840]   "You're gonna pay me for this and then I'm gone.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.120]   "I'm not going to consult with you.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.520]   "I'm not gonna stay around because I want the freedom."
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.720]   Everything along the way,
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.400]   every choice I made was to get me to this point.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.500]   And so when somebody goes like,
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.680]   "Oh, you're just lucky."
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.520]   (laughs)
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.800]   I'm like, "No, this is very deliberate."
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.000]   In fact, let's rewind even further.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.160]   A friend gave me a really good example of this
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.460]   when he said he doesn't believe in luck.
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.040]   And I said, "Yeah, says the guy that was lucky
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.280]   "to be born in a first world country
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.600]   "'cause he was born in America."
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.060]   I said, "Yeah, easy for the American
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.620]   "to say he doesn't believe in luck, right?
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.840]   "Tell that to somebody in South Sudan."
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.720]   And he's just like, "Dude," he said,
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.400]   "I was born in America because my grandparents
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.200]   "left everything they know in Poland
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.520]   "and got on a ship for four months
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.160]   "and sailed all the way to this country
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.960]   "where they didn't speak the language.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.700]   "And it was incredibly hard, but they did it
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.180]   "because they felt that would give their children
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.680]   "a better future."
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:05.240]   And then even their children were like
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.820]   children of Polish immigrants
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.960]   that lived in a bad neighborhood
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.960]   but worked really hard to save their money
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.200]   and spend nothing on pleasures
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.640]   so that they could save it for their kids.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:22.120]   And then yes, I grew up in Chicago or whatever
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.080]   with a nice life, but it took two generations, he said.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:27.600]   So I think that's insulting to call that luck.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.680]   He said, "My nice life is the result
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.720]   "of like 80 years of sacrifice."
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.500]   And I was like, "Okay, all right, very good point."
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.020]   So I still believe in luck, like crazy.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.180]   I still think that most of my success was luck,
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:45.860]   but a lot of little decisions that you make
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:49.180]   on a day-to-day level can have huge impacts
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.020]   on the direction of the rest of your life.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.900]   - You knew freedom was something you wanted to optimize for
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.460]   over years.
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.680]   I meet lots of people that maybe don't know that thing.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.540]   The job comes, it offers to pay them more,
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.260]   it doesn't have the flexibility to travel.
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.960]   They don't know what they want in life.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.020]   Is the answer to always optimize for freedom
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:09.820]   because it gives you more options in the future?
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.060]   Or is there a time where more financial resources
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.260]   can add more value?
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.060]   Or is there a framework you have for thinking about
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.360]   what do I want right now in my life?
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.260]   What do I look up to?
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.780]   Who do I wanna be?
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.860]   - Well, like we said at the very beginning,
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.940]   sometimes you need to ask yourself,
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.600]   "What is my life lacking right now?"
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:32.020]   And I need to steer that direction to get my balance back.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:37.020]   But more often it helps to look at the common thread
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:42.740]   in your life so far, like your life choices so far.
[00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.340]   In reality, what has been something that,
[00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:49.600]   through all the choices, has made you the happiest?
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.460]   And maybe it's money, maybe it's choosing the option
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.300]   that binds you tighter to people.
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.960]   Like maybe you're one of those lucky people
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.260]   that at the age of 19 found the love of your life.
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:04.420]   And ever since then, like your friends
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.900]   had crazy dating adventures,
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.580]   but you've been happy to be with one person
[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.500]   since the age of 19.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.220]   And you know that, like that's given you
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.180]   such a deep happiness in life that can't compare
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.460]   to all these little digital nomads
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.700]   bragging about their freedom.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:21.140]   And they're just like, "Yeah, but guess what?
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.460]   "I've got something better than that."
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.740]   You need to just look back at your life
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.440]   to notice what continuously makes you the happiest.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.420]   And use that when making your future decisions as well.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.720]   For me, it was freedom,
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.500]   but for somebody else, it might be money.
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.640]   They might say, "You know what?
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:41.520]   "The kind of life I want, I really want a swimming pool,
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.860]   "and I really want a Ferrari,
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.620]   "and I really want three houses."
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.640]   And it's like, "All right then, for what you really want,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.700]   "especially if that's in practice, not just in theory,
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.560]   "if you've actually rented a Ferrari for a week
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.800]   "and you know that owning that Ferrari
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.260]   "will make you so much happier,
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.960]   "if you know that in practice, not just in theory,
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.080]   "then all right, this is gonna help shape your decisions
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.680]   "that you need to go for the option that pays more
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.000]   "versus the freedom option.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.440]   "You shouldn't be a digital nomad
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.240]   "if a Ferrari is super important to you
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.360]   "because it's harder to bring that Ferrari
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.100]   "to Thailand and Columbia."
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.100]   Not everybody should choose what I've chosen.
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.060]   That would be stupid.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.000]   You should choose what you've noticed
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.460]   in practice makes you the happiest.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:30.300]   - For anyone who doesn't know Derek's full story,
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.560]   you had the option when you sold your company
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.800]   to take all the money and live the life of Ferraris
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.720]   and swimming pools and wanted to kind of take that
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.680]   off the table as a future path
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.560]   that you could even be tempted by and gave it all away.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.860]   So I thought that was kind of an ultimate hack in my mind
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.800]   of you didn't want the chance to ever be
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.560]   kind of turned towards a life
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.000]   that you weren't actually interested in,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:52.840]   you just gave it away.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:55.960]   I noticed from the past.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.780]   I knew that choice would make me happier.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.200]   It was really obvious when I was looking
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.560]   at all the different options of what to do
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.240]   when selling my company.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.160]   And when I looked at the option of giving the money away,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.740]   but in a way where I do continue to get a trickle
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:10.280]   paid out to me for the rest of my life,
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.680]   that option made me way happier because that made it
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.520]   so I couldn't get into this scenario
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.440]   where I had $20 million just sitting in a bank
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   to do something stupid with.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.720]   I didn't want that option.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.720]   I knew that option would make me unhappy
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:25.640]   because that's too much money.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.320]   But having half a million in the bank,
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.520]   that makes me happy, that gives me freedom,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   but that's not too much.
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.160]   It's not stupid money, just very nice.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.040]   - And you mentioned to look back at who you've been
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.640]   and what you've done.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.920]   There's something that I took away from you
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.880]   that I think has been really valuable
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.240]   is not just looking at the thoughts and the opinions
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.640]   you've had, but what you've done.
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:48.120]   Like looking at your actual actions.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.760]   You've said, I think that your actions
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.480]   actually reveal your values.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.280]   Maybe we could talk on this just for a minute is,
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.120]   you know, it's interesting.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.920]   Some people I know say, "I'm the person that does this."
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.480]   But if you're not actually doing it,
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.720]   are you really that person?
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.200]   So...
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.400]   - Right.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   You know, it's funny, I need to read that post again.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.160]   I had almost forgotten about that one.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.520]   I'll tell the little tale quickly.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.120]   The article is at sive.rs/arv,
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.680]   ARV meaning actions reveal values.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.520]   So I remember that short URL I gave it
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.080]   and I should revisit it now.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:20.920]   Almost forgotten.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.080]   So the story is, I was talking to an old friend of mine
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:29.040]   and I had been putting off starting this company
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.320]   called Muckwork.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.160]   I had this idea, like literally the day after
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.120]   I sold Seedy Baby, I had this idea
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.480]   for my next company called Muckwork.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:41.040]   And I got four months into it and then I paused
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.160]   to go explore the world instead.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.560]   And here we are 10 years later and I said to my friend,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.120]   oh, I really wanna do Muckwork.
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.080]   I really wanna make this happen.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.880]   And my friend goes, "No, you don't."
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.320]   I went, "What do you mean no, I don't?
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.640]   "I'm telling you, yes, I do."
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.200]   And he goes, "No, you don't."
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.120]   I said, "Dude, you can't just tell me I don't.
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.320]   "I'm telling you, I really wanna do this."
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.720]   And he said, "No, you don't.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.800]   "You don't really wanna do this.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.200]   "If you really wanted to do this,
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.480]   "you would have made it happen right now."
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.040]   He said, "You keep putting it off,
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.640]   "which to me makes it clear
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.120]   "that you don't really want this thing
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.480]   "'cause otherwise you would have just done it.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.320]   "You wouldn't be saying I want to do it.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.920]   "You would do it if you really wanted to do it."
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.480]   I went, "Oh, wow."
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.240]   And he said, "Yeah, your actions reveal your values."
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.840]   And that's been so, so useful to me.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   Wow, actually, Chris, thanks for bringing this up
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.600]   because that is kind of in theory versus in practice
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.320]   revealed, put into action, right?
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.400]   It's don't think about what you want in theory.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:41.400]   Look at what you've chosen in the past
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.600]   or look at what your actions have revealed
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.240]   your values to be.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:47.280]   - Ever since I read that post, I've just been reflecting it.
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.920]   I've been sharing it with people.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.760]   Someone I talked to was like,
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.040]   "I really want to lose weight.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.800]   "I've wanted to lose weight for the last two years."
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.840]   I'm like, "Do you know how?"
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.480]   And they're like, "Yeah, I know I need to exercise."
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.840]   And it's like, "Well, I don't think you really want to."
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:57:59.680]   Which is fine.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.000]   I'm not trying to cast judgment.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.160]   I'm just saying, you know how to do something.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.160]   You say you really want to do it and you haven't done it.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.800]   Maybe you don't want to do it and that's okay.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.080]   And so it's made me reflect on my own life.
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.640]   Oh, if I say I really want to do this,
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.720]   I should either do it or stop saying it.
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.080]   Like, there's no point in continuing to say
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.000]   you want to do something if you're not willing to do it.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.200]   And that simple phrase of your actions
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.320]   revealing your values has made it easy for me
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.040]   to make one of two decisions.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.840]   Either, yes, let's do it, or let's stop
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.080]   and let's not put it at the top of the priority list
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.600]   and just continue to push it down.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.440]   So that's been really helpful.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.000]   Thank you.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.080]   - Yeah, you know, I'm just thinking about
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.440]   how you could use that to do tests
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.960]   of something you think you want.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.760]   See if you actually want it in practice.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.440]   Like if somebody says, "I really want to lose weight."
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:45.760]   It's like, all right, well, let's spend at least one week
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.560]   where you eat nothing but protein twice a day
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.400]   and that's all you eat.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.040]   Let's make sure that's what you really want.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.640]   Or, "I really want a Ferrari."
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.000]   Okay, rent one for a week
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.240]   and see if it really makes you so much happier.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.000]   Or, "I want to be a minimalist."
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.960]   Like, all right, well, leave everything behind
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:08.280]   and go spend a year living in Lithuania with nothing.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.720]   And if you like it in practice, not just in theory,
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.800]   you got to try these things.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.080]   Sometimes it reveals itself to be a lot easier.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.080]   Starting this podcast for me was one where I was like,
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.200]   I'd always wanted to do something.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.840]   I tried a blog, I tried a newsletter,
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.640]   and I never really found the thing.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:26.920]   And once I put the podcast out there,
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.240]   I was like, oh, it's actually,
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.480]   it's not as hard as I had thought,
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:34.200]   but it wasn't until I realized that if I didn't do it,
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.920]   then I didn't really want to do it in the first place.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.040]   So why not just force yourself to try?
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.120]   And you're like, oh, it's actually,
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.280]   I'm more capable of doing this, it's easier.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.840]   So for me, I think it's just that framework
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   has helped make it easier for me to do things
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:48.000]   that probably would have been harder
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.760]   before thinking with that perspective.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.240]   And there's two things we haven't hit on
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.520]   that I think are really important lessons.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.280]   One, you've written an entire book
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:55.920]   that I would encourage people to read
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.080]   about when to say yes and no.
[00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.640]   And I think someone might look at the title,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.400]   which is "Hell Yeah or No" and say,
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.120]   "Oh, you should always either be fervently excited
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:05.680]   or say no to everything."
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.080]   I actually know that your perspective is,
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.800]   it really depends on where you are in life.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.120]   And if you are very overwhelmed with things,
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.160]   a philosophy of hell yeah now or no is great.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.280]   But if you're earlier in your career,
[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.600]   maybe you just say yes to everything.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.040]   And I've written posts in the past
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.320]   about earlier in my career,
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.440]   why saying yes is just this magical thing
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.120]   that opens all these doors
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.160]   and lets you have new experiences.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.400]   Is there any kind of clarifying things you want to say
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:33.960]   on the kind of spectrum of say no to lots of things
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.600]   versus say yes to everything
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.680]   that might help people overwhelmed right now?
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:41.880]   - I'm really glad that you said that.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.680]   In fact, you might be the first person
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:46.160]   that's ever introduced that book
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.120]   by also giving that clarifier right away.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.960]   'Cause yeah, you're right.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.640]   Almost everybody looks at that and says,
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.720]   "Yeah, man, hell yeah, I know.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.320]   I'm just gonna follow that from now on."
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.520]   And I get these emails from people
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.200]   that are like straight out of college going,
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.720]   "Yeah, thanks for saying that, man.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.600]   I'm just saying no to everything
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.440]   I don't feel hell yeah about."
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.960]   And I'm like, "Wait a second, hold on.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.960]   It's a tool for a specific situation.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.480]   It's in the toolbox.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.600]   It's that really unique wrench
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.200]   in case you need to get into the hole
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.800]   and do a Phillips head screw."
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.680]   In general, I think it's better to switch strategies
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.280]   for your correct situation.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.440]   So yeah, straight out of college,
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.440]   or if you're young and say,
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.680]   if you want more opportunities than you have right now,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.760]   you want more success than you have right now.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.600]   Yeah, very often the best solution
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.800]   is to go say yes to everything.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.160]   Take on as much as you can take on,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.000]   try it all, overcommit yourself,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.640]   and say yes to everything
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.880]   because it's a little bit like lottery tickets.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.040]   You never know which of these 12 things
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.400]   you're doing at once is going to reward you.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.080]   And then when one of those 12 things
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.360]   you're doing simultaneously rewards you,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.360]   then you can like double down on that,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.560]   get rid of the other 11
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.840]   and throw everything you've got into this one thing.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   And then that's when you should raise the bar
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.520]   'cause hell yeah or no basically just means that.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.120]   It just means raise the bar all the way
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.400]   for what you'll accept.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.080]   So you wanna do that
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.280]   if you're overwhelmed with opportunities
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.880]   and everybody wants a piece of you
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.920]   and you've got so much success coming your way,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.320]   then that's when you need hell yeah or no
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.040]   as a reminder to raise the bar
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.320]   to let go of these other options
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.880]   because you've got so much going on.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.240]   So yeah, so thanks for mentioning that.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.280]   It's the very first sentence of the article,
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   but it often gets lost in that point.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.240]   - It could also apply to just so much going on in life.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.480]   You have two young kids, you have a job,
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.960]   you have a family,
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.080]   and it wasn't that there were new business opportunities
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.160]   or financial opportunities,
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.400]   it's just life got so busy that to maintain sanity,
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.880]   you have to raise the bar.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.440]   And I found that as a 20 something single person,
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.760]   people say, "Hey, you wanna go to this thing?"
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.720]   "Yeah, I wanna go to this thing."
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:58.800]   "Yeah, I wanna do this thing."
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:02:59.720]   It's easy.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.400]   And then we have two kids,
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.320]   my wife and I can't go out to every dinner.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.360]   We can't go to every concert.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.800]   Some of our friends without children are like,
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.400]   "Oh, do you guys wanna go to Belize for the weekend?"
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.080]   We're like, "No, that's not a thing
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.280]   we can just do on a whim."
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.040]   And we've created an intentional life
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.000]   that we're happy with,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.720]   but it just means we can't do those things.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.800]   So I think right now,
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.400]   this year is a little bit more of the year
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.320]   of the hell yeah or no than the say yes to everything.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.080]   But it's not necessarily because of opportunity,
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.600]   it's just because the overwhelming nature of life
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.120]   with young children.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:31.960]   - Thanks for mentioning that
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.880]   because sometimes I think in terms of like
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.680]   business career choices with hell yeah or no,
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.520]   but you're right.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.480]   It's when you've got a kid,
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.040]   that's your hell yeah or your kids.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.120]   And so that helps you say no to everything else.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.600]   It helps to remember that you'd be better off
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.720]   putting more attention into your kids
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.240]   instead of spreading yourself thin with other things.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.000]   In fact, I feel like I've unfairly mentioned
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.200]   moving too much in this conversation,
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.040]   but I was living in Singapore when my kid was born.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.120]   And Singapore is a very exciting, distracting place.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.160]   I knew a lot of people there.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.960]   I was super social there.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.160]   There's so much going on.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.840]   And even its location within Asia,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.760]   it's just a short hop to so many interesting places.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.080]   And I noticed that the first few months of my kid's life,
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.040]   I was too distracted and I was being pulled
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.240]   different directions.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.440]   So a big part of the choice to move
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.880]   to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.760]   was to create an environment where I've just,
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.560]   by side effect of my location,
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.280]   I've said no to everything else.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.040]   So for my kid from age zero to 10 here in New Zealand,
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.640]   I was basically a full-time dad.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.520]   I was in the middle of an island in the Pacific Ocean
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.680]   where just everything else in life became a no
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.160]   because I'm here with my kid and this is my hell yeah.
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.160]   - So I wanna get to children,
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.440]   but I have one quick question,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.280]   which is can you talk about the saying no part?
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.320]   Because I think it's very easy for a lot of people to say,
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.920]   this is the hell yeah thing.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.400]   And then they get an email from someone's like,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.560]   hey, I'd love to pick your brain about this thing.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.080]   Do you wanna grab a coffee?
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:09.760]   And I think saying no is something people find very hard
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.640]   and they almost feel like I'm gonna look bad by saying no.
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.840]   People are gonna think that I don't care.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.920]   And you've said a few things
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.480]   that have given me perspective there
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.400]   that I think would just be helpful
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.040]   for people to understand why saying no
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.080]   might be in some weird way polite or a better way to do it.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.040]   - Yeah, my number one tip is write a form letter.
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   Take 20 minutes and write a very nice generic no
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:41.360]   with a little elaboration like, hey, I'm so sorry.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.560]   I'm completely focused on what I'm doing right now.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.240]   My new book isn't finished yet
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.200]   and I need to put everything I've got into finishing this.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.680]   I hope you'll understand this isn't a permanent no,
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.280]   maybe at some point in the future.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.240]   I really appreciate that you thought of me for this.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.400]   I'm honored that you invited me, whatever.
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   Take 20 minutes and write a nice form letter response
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.280]   and then keep it handy in a word file or a text file
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.520]   or whatever you use so that it might even be five times a day
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.720]   when you get people wanting to pick your brain
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.000]   or come to this thing or,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.320]   hey dude, you got a minute to jump on a Zoom call.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.240]   You could just copy paste, select all,
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.280]   tab, control V, send.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.480]   I do my form letter so many times a day.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.080]   I just have a generic no.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.240]   And what's nice is that people respond to it
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.840]   every now and then going, wow,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.520]   that's the nicest no I've ever received.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.480]   And dude, you're actually kind of inspiring
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.200]   how you're keeping your head down in your work.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.800]   Man, I should be more like that.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.160]   Like you think people are gonna be mad,
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.320]   but actually people often get inspired
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.520]   by how you say no to their random things.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.320]   - I wouldn't necessarily put this in a form letter,
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.000]   but I heard you say once that you say no
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.360]   so that you leave your calendar open to say yes.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.640]   And if someone's calendar is always full,
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.840]   it's almost like, oh man,
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.000]   this person isn't leaving enough time for exciting things.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.480]   - When I just said that like for 10 years,
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.880]   I was basically a full-time dad.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.400]   Dude, for 10 years, I didn't even have a calendar.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.000]   There was like literally nothing on my calendar.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.360]   Maybe like once a year we would take a flight
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.200]   to go see his grandparents.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.240]   But yeah, for 10 years, I had nothing on my calendar app.
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.920]   And when somebody would wanna schedule,
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.640]   they're like, hey, can I call you next Thursday at three?
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   I'd go, eh, I'm not gonna like bust open the calendar app.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.840]   You'll be like the only thing in 2018
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.160]   on my entire calendar for the year.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.200]   Like, no, just call.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.360]   Whenever you wanna call, just call.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.920]   I'm not gonna schedule.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.120]   I don't do scheduling.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.360]   I mean, now I do.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.680]   My kid's 11 now and he's playing with friends.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.960]   He doesn't need me around so much.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.880]   So I'm not as much of a full-time dad
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   as I was the last 10 years.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.600]   But yeah, for 10 years, that was fun
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.760]   to just say no to all of it.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.960]   And to have this completely empty calendar
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.880]   is such a good feeling.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.080]   To wake up, God, that's one of my deepest joys,
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.360]   to wake up every day or to wake up any day
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.440]   and have nothing on my calendar for that whole day.
[01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.400]   Like the whole day is mine.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.480]   It's such a nice feeling.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.360]   - Let's talk about some of the perspective
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.240]   you had for parenting.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.920]   Because I think right before we jumped in,
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.760]   I was sharing your post about parenting with my wife.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.080]   And we were both like, wow.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:19.240]   You kind of talk in it, and I'll put it in the show notes.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.720]   You can talk about it as much as you want.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.000]   It's not very long.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.280]   But how it seems like sometimes
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.520]   by focusing so much on your child,
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.160]   you're just completely selfless
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.200]   and you just can feel like work.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.240]   But if you present it in a perspective,
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.560]   that's like, oh, by doing these things
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.360]   that many of us wish that we could do more
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.280]   for or with our children,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.520]   you're actually doing things that will help you.
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.720]   And that perspective, I know plenty of people are like,
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.120]   oh, my partner's gone
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.040]   and I've got childcare duty for the whole day.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.640]   And I think there's a different perspective
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.760]   of ways that you could enrich your own life,
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.360]   not just by spending time with someone,
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.840]   but by teaching lessons and acting a different way.
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.040]   I'm curious how you thought of that,
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.080]   how long it took you to come to those realizations.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.560]   - Remind me, where do you live now?
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.120]   - I live in the Bay Area.
[01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.600]   - Okay, so yeah, whenever I was on daddy duty,
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.120]   'cause his mom and I always split it 50/50,
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.000]   every day or every week,
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.600]   we'd make sure that it was always 50/50.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.320]   We didn't have a nanny or anything like that.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.480]   It was always just the two of us
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.400]   and we live far away from family.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.600]   So there was nobody else to help.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:25.680]   So it was either her on duty or me on duty.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   So she had her own way, right?
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.520]   So she likes watching things and she likes being inside.
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:30.360]   Like that's how she grew up.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.840]   She's more indoorsy.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.160]   So then I found it my duty
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:38.080]   whenever I was on daddy duty to take him out.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.960]   No matter what the weather, even if it's raining,
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.280]   that was like my number one thing.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.960]   Like, let's just get out.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.400]   To satisfy my own curiosity,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.680]   I would pick somewhere on the map that we had never been.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.760]   I'd like look at the map and I'd see this green patch.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.160]   I'm like, I don't know what's there.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.040]   Like today we're going there.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.680]   So we would go to that green patch,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.080]   get out of the car and just hang out there for the day.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.800]   And we would spend like two hours, six hours
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.080]   in this green patch I'd never been to.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.800]   So I got to know the area really, really well by doing that.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.000]   And now let's say like, if it's really bad weather,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.680]   there's some days where I'd say like,
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.040]   all right, let's watch a movie.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.320]   But instead of just picking the dumbest
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.040]   Hotel Transylvania 3 kind of entertainment,
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.400]   I do a little work to find some like beautiful
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.120]   award-winning animated movie from somewhere,
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.480]   ideally in another language or another culture
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.520]   that I would find really interesting.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.200]   I'd find this kind of like, I don't know,
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.840]   this German animated thing and subtitles.
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.480]   So my kid who doesn't read is just watching this in German,
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.400]   but I'm like, cool.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.080]   The German language is getting into his ears
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.920]   a little bit today.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:49.760]   And I'm watching an animated movie that I find interesting,
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.240]   not just like the lowest common denominator.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.200]   So I would make choices like that to enrich his experience
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   by often going somewhere new, watching something new.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.560]   Sometimes we just listen to music.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.760]   We'd kind of like cuddle and listen to say like
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.720]   Indian classical music while making Lego.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:08.560]   Actually, that was a good way.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.800]   He calls it Lego music.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.440]   Indian classical music, he considers Lego music
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.520]   because I just thought like, all right,
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.480]   as long as we're just making Lego,
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.640]   let's open his ears a bit
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.400]   and put on a different kind of music.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.240]   And it had like speakers in the living room
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.560]   so he could really kind of hear it,
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.240]   not just coming out of a tinny little one inch speaker.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.480]   So yeah, choices like that, I just found to me made
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:32.120]   being a full-time dad, it made it a joy
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.320]   because I would keep choosing these decisions
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.560]   that were good for both of us.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.920]   - And I think one of the big ones
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.680]   that you've read about is travel.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.400]   And you wrote a post that says,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.000]   "Travels best with young children."
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.160]   And I was telling my wife about it.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:45.640]   She's like, "How old are this guy's kids?"
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.560]   I don't think I said young.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.760]   I said, "Oh, he wrote this great post
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.600]   about travel with children."
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.320]   She's like, "Yeah, but are they 15?"
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.520]   So I think there's this idea
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.760]   of traveling with young children being horrible
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.000]   and it being the worst experience.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.160]   And you write the exact opposite.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.560]   And I've gotten so many emails from listeners saying,
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.400]   "Oh, can you talk more about travel with children
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.640]   and how to make it enjoyable?"
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.800]   And as early as this morning,
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.440]   someone emailed me saying, "I'm going on this trip.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.360]   I can't remember where they're going."
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.040]   She's like, "I have a six-year-old and a one-year-old
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:13.880]   and we're nervous.
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.000]   How do you have a good trip traveling with children?"
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.320]   Very few people I know have a perspective
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.120]   of positive experience.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.400]   So I'd love to wrap up a little bit and talk about that
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.360]   because we talk about travel a lot on this show
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.760]   and so many people are interested.
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.640]   How do you travel with your child
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.560]   and have a great experience when doing it?
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.400]   And what advice do you have for people
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.800]   about to go on a trip with their children?
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.680]   - I love this subject.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:38.120]   I wrote that post because I got so frustrated
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.520]   at people acting like it was just a truism,
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.360]   like traveling with kids is hard
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.600]   or once you have kids, you can't travel anymore.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.520]   I was like, damn, like the difference between in theory
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.480]   and in practice, some people just decide in advance
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.960]   in theory, well, can't travel anymore, got kids now.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:58.080]   Just gonna have to stay put.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.640]   No more dreaming for me.
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.080]   But in practice, it's wonderful.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.280]   Maybe you need to just change your mindset about it
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:08.080]   in advance, but I just find that for one,
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:11.240]   you don't need to pack hardly anything
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.040]   because anywhere you go has stuff for kids.
[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.560]   I started traveling with our kid
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:21.320]   when he was three months old and in diapers
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.120]   and you realize you don't need to pack 50 diapers,
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.160]   you need to pack like six diapers,
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.880]   maybe to get you through the first day
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.000]   'cause anywhere you're gonna go has diapers.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.760]   You don't need to pack toys because anywhere you go
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.920]   is gonna have toys and if he's really stuck
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.320]   for entertainment and really needs a physical thing
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.200]   beyond just the one or two things that you bring with,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.800]   then there are new physical things wherever you go.
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.440]   And I don't mean like things to buy,
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.440]   it may just be like random items found in the grass
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.360]   or on the street corner can be fascinating.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.480]   God, he got so much joy out of this like rusty spring
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.120]   he found once in the gutter.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.120]   We went to Wales and he found this rusty spring
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.360]   in the gutter that he just held onto for a week
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.080]   and just loved this spring.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.840]   And it was like his favorite toy for the whole week
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.280]   while we were traveling in England
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.520]   that he found literally in the gutter in Wales.
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.280]   So you don't need to pack much, that's a big one.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.640]   As long as you leave early, like don't forget
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.280]   that the airport itself is a fascinating destination
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:29.400]   for kids, like, oh my God, it might as well
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.600]   practically be Disneyland, there is so much there.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:36.680]   So you get to the airport way early, like four hours early,
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   there's no rush, there's no stress
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.440]   because your kids love to explore the airport.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.240]   Even when he's just a little choo-choo crawling baby,
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.400]   he loved the attention from some of these strangers.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.440]   Like suddenly there's like hundreds of faces
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.560]   looking at him and he'd be like, "Oh."
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:55.520]   You know, like so many strangers wanna play with him.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.240]   He loved hanging out at the airport.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.600]   So then the flight itself, my number one advice
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.600]   for kids under the age of two or three is,
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.400]   I know this is gonna sound radical,
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.760]   but I actually got this from a great book
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.080]   called "Brain Rules for Baby" by John Medina.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   University of Washington, a neuroscientist
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.320]   has been studying brain development in babies for years.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.680]   And his number one bit of advice,
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.920]   well, sorry, number two bit of advice.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:22.680]   Number one bit of advice was help your kids feel safe.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.400]   Like number one, kids need to feel safe so they can flourish.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.880]   But number two was, he said,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.800]   no screens before the age of two.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.400]   And in fact, the longer they can go without screens
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.520]   in front of them, the better.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.920]   But he said like, absolutely do not let your kid
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.080]   stare at a screen before the age of two.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.080]   So I heeded his advice.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.640]   And we had no screens in the house, no iPads,
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   no movies, whatever, before the age of two.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:52.480]   But the one exception is when we would get on a flight.
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:57.400]   And because he had no screens at all in his life,
[01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:00.160]   you wonder how to keep a kid still in a seat,
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.560]   like let them watch the screen.
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.480]   Suddenly he was just hypnotized
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.440]   and he would be absolutely still on a flight
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.280]   to the point where many different times
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.160]   when the flight was done,
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:13.320]   we'd be getting up, exiting the plane
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.800]   and somebody in front of us or behind us would go,
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.800]   "Whoa, there was a kid here that whole time."
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:19.720]   And they didn't even know
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.160]   because their kid was so hypnotized by the screen.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.320]   So I don't know, that was a good hack.
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.920]   And hey, that's why we're here, right?
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.760]   All the hacks.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.600]   So that was a good hack.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.640]   And then when you get to a place,
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   you don't try to force your kid into your adult schedule.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.240]   You don't say, all right, we're going to Paris,
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.080]   we're gonna see the Louvre,
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   we're gonna see the Eiffel Tower,
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.880]   we're gonna look at the Arc de Triomphe at one o'clock
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880]   and we're gonna get it.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.480]   You just let go of all that.
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   Traveling with kids is so nice to just get to a destination
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.640]   and let go of your expectations
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.320]   to basically let your kid and circumstance lead the way.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.400]   So you're just gonna get there
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.360]   and then you just go out into the world with your kid
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.120]   and let them explore and let them lead the way.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.280]   Isn't that a Whitney Houston song?
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.480]   You just let them lead and be on their schedule.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.420]   What I love about that is then you get to experience
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.200]   this place through your kid's eyes.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.680]   Right, so I remember taking my kid to Thailand
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.960]   when he was like six months old.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.840]   He was a crawling baby.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:19.760]   He wasn't even walking.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.600]   He was just crawling.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.200]   And we would just go someplace like a temple
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.360]   that was gorgeous with the big golden stupas
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:29.280]   and just let him crawl around.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.840]   And he would just be crawling around this temple
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.080]   and everybody's giving him attention.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.600]   He'd play with strangers,
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.560]   a Buddhist monk picks him up and holds him
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.800]   and he's loving this attention and people take his picture
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.000]   and he crawls around the whole time.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.400]   We're just laid back kind of like enjoying the temple
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.780]   and our baby crawling around.
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:46.680]   And same thing with like just going out to a park
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.720]   and he's seeing different things.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.240]   He sees monkeys, oh my God, you know,
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.240]   like it's all so easy when you let your kid lead the way.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.360]   Locals connect with you more.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.280]   Everybody wants to come up and interact with the baby.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.320]   So all these locals that don't speak English
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.560]   and we can't communicate through language,
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.640]   but sweet old ladies come up
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.080]   and they wanna play with your baby.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.400]   I don't know, I just, I absolutely love it.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.240]   I kind of don't wanna travel without my kid.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.520]   I think traveling with my kid at any age
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.200]   and even now, like he just turned 11.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.120]   I just took him to Japan for two weeks.
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.400]   His mom had to work, so it was just me and him.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.640]   And it was amazing to go see Japan through his eyes.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.080]   I've been to Japan a few times in my life,
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.840]   but like I kept myself out of it.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.680]   I just took us to Kanazawa on the West Coast
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.200]   and we just stayed there for four days
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.600]   and down to Kyoto for four days,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.280]   then up to Tokyo for four days,
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.920]   stopped at one hot springs resort town on the way
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.360]   so I could experience like a real hot springs resort.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.440]   And other than that, like just day to day,
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.480]   we'd wake up and I'd say, "All right, dude,
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.040]   "what do you wanna do?
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.920]   "You lead, I'll follow you."
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.960]   And it was so unexpected.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.920]   I thought he'd be overwhelmed by Tokyo,
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.800]   but he loved it.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.680]   In fact, sometimes when I was kind of tired,
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.400]   he's like, "Let's go out again."
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.760]   He said, "Let's go down this alley."
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   And I just let him lead the way.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.960]   He's like, "Let's go see what's upstairs."
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.160]   All right, sure.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:08.640]   And it was great, it introduced so much randomness.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.560]   He chose things I wouldn't have chosen.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.260]   He's like my favorite travel partner
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:15.080]   and has been since he was born.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   So I think travel with kids is easy and wonderful.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.920]   - We went to London and Paris in December with two kids,
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.680]   six months and two and a half.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.400]   We didn't try to cram in the Louvre.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.600]   We'd picked places that, at least in Paris's case,
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.040]   we'd both been to before.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:33.600]   One of the challenges that I'm curious
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.920]   to hear your perspective on,
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.080]   maybe this gets better after multiple times.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.840]   This is our first kind of trip to a city with kids.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.760]   A part of it was like, "Oh, we're so used to
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.040]   "how much we try to accomplish on a trip with children."
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.720]   You just have to cut your expectations way back.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.120]   So I think if we wanted to have an enjoyable trip each day,
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.840]   the goal was, "What's the one thing we're gonna do today?"
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.580]   Our list pre-kids was like,
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.480]   "Here's the eight things we'll do."
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.080]   Now it's one.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.160]   And I wonder now if we went back,
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.180]   we weren't going in with eight,
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:06.160]   maybe we had two and we realized one was more sustainable.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:09.020]   But if you go all the way, halfway across the world,
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.000]   not everyone has months at a time.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.800]   So let's say you're there for a week
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.640]   and you're only doing one thing a day,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.720]   you might feel like you didn't get as much value
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.640]   out of the trip because you spent all this money
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.060]   to travel and stay and eat,
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.480]   but you didn't get to do that much.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.480]   I have a feeling that you have a way
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:31.200]   to rephrase the perspective that will make anyone listening
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.840]   realize that they got just as much of a trip
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.520]   even though it was different.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.040]   But I feel like the way you'll say it
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.960]   will give people that feeling far greater
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   than the way I would.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.280]   So I'm curious how you would kind of rebut the idea
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.760]   that if you're not doing a lot
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.120]   because you can't have as much on your agenda,
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.760]   you're not gonna have the kind of trip
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.480]   that will make it worth it.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.440]   - I figure that if I've decided I wanna go to Paris
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.360]   and I've got that specific example too,
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.800]   I'm just choosing the where,
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.200]   I'm just saying we're going to Paris.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.240]   And I'll say, okay.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.040]   So I took us to Paris.
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.000]   And once we got out of the train station
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.880]   at the Gare du Nord, is that it?
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.840]   The north one, I think.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.100]   I just let him choose.
[01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.520]   I was like, well, we're in Paris now,
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.880]   which way do you wanna go?
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.840]   And he was just like, go that way.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.680]   I said, okay.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.160]   And I just followed him.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.720]   And I'm so glad I did because at every turn,
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.080]   he just decided where he wanted to go.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.000]   He led the way.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.080]   And at one point he found this huge cardboard box
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.000]   that was as big as he is.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.560]   And he's like, dad, check out this box.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.480]   And he got inside this cardboard box.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.120]   And for the next half an hour,
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.960]   he walked the streets of Paris inside a big cardboard box.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.640]   And I got such joy out of that.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.200]   I made a little phone movie of it,
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.960]   of the streets of Paris,
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.920]   like in a busy center part of town
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.960]   with him taking up the whole sidewalk,
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.840]   walking inside this big cardboard box
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.040]   and everybody doing these double takes,
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.160]   like what the hell?
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.480]   And me just cracking up at the juxtaposition
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.560]   of not only is my kid taking up the sidewalk,
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.720]   walking into huge cardboard box,
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:07.960]   but OMFG Paris, like to be doing this in Paris.
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.960]   And oh my God, there's the Eiffel Tower in the background
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.120]   as my kid is like walking in a cardboard box.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.440]   And then at some point he sees a huge staircase.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:19.160]   It's like starting to get dark and it's dusk.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.760]   And he's like, whoa, he's like, look at all those stairs.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.600]   He said, let's go this way.
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:23.680]   I said, all right.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.800]   He's out of the box at this point.
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.400]   And we go up and up and up and up and up these steps.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.680]   And we get to the top and we take this turn.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.560]   And it's like, oh,
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:37.760]   one of the most top five beautiful things
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.800]   I've ever seen in my life.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.160]   He accidentally led us to Sacré-Cœur,
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.880]   the big giant cathedral,
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.920]   which just because it was dusk
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.760]   was like being lit up by floodlights,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.920]   but the sky was like dark blue.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.040]   And it's at the top of the stairs, but you don't expect it.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.120]   Like you turn up the stairs and suddenly
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.720]   it's just staring at you and it's like,
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.680]   oh my God, it looks so surreal.
[01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:01.840]   And it was one of my favorite things on that whole trip
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.640]   was us accidentally discovering Sacré-Cœur,
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.440]   which I had only seen in postcards
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.480]   or photos at that point.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.480]   I'd never seen it in person.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.000]   And it was only because he led the way.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.920]   Like that wasn't on my itinerary
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.120]   and I wouldn't have put it on my itinerary.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.920]   I didn't even really know what it was called.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.400]   I had just seen pictures of it before, but yeah,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.120]   letting your kids lead the way makes them happy.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.600]   And it leads to so many wonderful random encounters.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.880]   - Yeah, I think it's just about reframing
[01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.240]   what makes a good trip, right?
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.840]   In an earlier life,
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:38.160]   a great trip to Paris might've involved
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:41.200]   ticking off a few restaurants your friends had recommended,
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.040]   seeing a few museums.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.320]   As you were talking, what really clicked for me
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.560]   was I thought, okay, well,
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.040]   if we're not gonna go do all those things
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.600]   and we're just gonna kind of walk around,
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.800]   then we could just do that here.
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.280]   Why do we need to go all the way to Paris?
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.440]   But there's something about being in Paris,
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.120]   doing that, that makes the memories different.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.440]   And the memories are why you're doing it in the first place.
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.120]   So I wanna challenge myself on the next trip
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.760]   to just kind of let go, do whatever, see where it goes,
[01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:14.040]   and see if we have just a totally different type of memory
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.560]   that's equally or potentially even better than we used to.
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:18.880]   It's just uncomfortable, right?
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.320]   'Cause it's not a type of thing I'm familiar with
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.440]   'cause that's not how we would travel pre-kid.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.760]   So we found the travel logistics
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.040]   to not be as overwhelming as much as the
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:31.240]   trying to find the balance between,
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.080]   I don't know, my wife and I,
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.200]   when we're in new cities, we're like,
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.840]   let's go find a cool bar and have a good cocktail.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.360]   Or let's go eat whatever the local food is.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.200]   And so it's like, okay, well,
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.400]   we gotta get to this restaurant.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.440]   But in London, nothing opens early enough
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.960]   to eat before kids' nap time.
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.320]   But if we reframed it and just said,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.520]   we're not going to have the trip we wanted to have
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.000]   when we were 10 years younger.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.480]   We're going to have a different style trip
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   where our children experience things
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.360]   and we get to watch that unfold.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   I think it would have been different.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.200]   And I think we maybe had the wrong expectations.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.280]   We still had a great trip,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.720]   but I think we could have had a better trip.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.280]   I find it really important.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.440]   This is just my values.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.160]   Nobody listening has to adopt my values,
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.360]   but a lot of the reason I was traveling
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.800]   was for him as much as me,
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.360]   because I wanted him to know that Paris is a place
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.960]   that he's been and has a connection to.
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.840]   So the trip was, when you say like,
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.280]   why not just stay home?
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.120]   Yeah, the trip was for him as much as me to know,
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.960]   like he can identify so many countries on a map now
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:37.320]   at age 11, and he's got a little connection
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:39.200]   to so many of them, even some that he hasn't been to,
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.360]   but I want him to feel a connection to the world.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.680]   So when somebody says France, he's like,
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.800]   oh yeah, I've been there.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.600]   And if somebody says Spain, he's like,
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.440]   oh yeah, I've been there.
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.160]   I wanted that for his self identity.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.000]   I want him to feel that the world is his home.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   Not just this one country where we're in right now,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.720]   but all of it, like the more of it, the better.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.040]   So I generally would take him on trips
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.040]   to places we've never been, let him lead the way.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.040]   He gets to feel the sense of autonomy.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.680]   You never have to worry about him being happy
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:11.480]   because if your kid is leading the way,
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.240]   I wouldn't know how to do it with two kids, I don't know.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.560]   But if your kid's leading the way, then he's happy
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.360]   and you get the randomness, but it's more about,
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.880]   yeah, just your kid feeling a connection
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.000]   to this place on earth.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.080]   That was most important to me.
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:25.040]   I didn't really care what we did in the place,
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.360]   but the reason I gasped while you were saying that is,
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.360]   Chris, satisficing and maximizing,
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:36.640]   it comes back full circle to the earlier in the conversation
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.680]   of you just described a way of travel
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.080]   that was trying to maximize.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.720]   You're like, all right, we've got 72 hours in Paris.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.240]   We are going to go to the best restaurants,
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:49.760]   the best sites, the best museum, like that's maximizing.
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.040]   And I think that's the wrong strategy.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.160]   I think satisficing is the correct strategy
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.120]   for travel with kids.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:56.960]   You're just like, all right,
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:59.760]   I'm just gonna book us a trip to Paris
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.200]   and we're gonna get off
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.500]   and we're gonna spend a few days in Paris.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:04.780]   I don't know what's gonna happen while we're there.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.040]   We'll see what happens.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.400]   We're gonna spend three days in Paris with no expectations.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.160]   That's probably a better recipe for happiness.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.920]   - It's my eternal struggle is to satisfice,
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.320]   but I will continue to try to make gains
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.960]   towards more satisficing.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.500]   - You should read that book.
[01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:21.800]   You should read "Hyperoxygeous."
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.840]   It's gonna stack up a bunch of reasons why you should.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.560]   - I already have it written down.
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:27.640]   I try not to be distracted and write things down,
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.320]   but every now and then in a conversation,
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.120]   I'm like, well, that deserves to be written down.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.780]   Okay, so there's two final things.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.160]   One is around satisficing.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.120]   There is a story I've somehow managed
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.960]   to hear you tell twice.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.920]   I've picked random things and sometimes I read it
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.320]   and sometimes I'm like, oh, let's just play.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.240]   And on your site, you read some of your posts.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.780]   And it's a perspective that sometimes
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.240]   taking a different path,
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.920]   taking the not perfect optimal maximizing path
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:58.800]   might actually not result in as worse
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.120]   of an outcome as you seem.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.960]   So one of the reasons I think a lot of us maximize
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.080]   is that we're like, we want the best,
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.360]   we want the optimal outcome.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.320]   And if you don't get it, in our minds,
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.280]   it feels like you'll be spending so much more money,
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:09.880]   but it might actually only be $10.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.140]   Could you talk about this bike ride
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.760]   where you stopped to slow down?
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.400]   Because I think it's a good way to wrap up the conversation
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.600]   because sometimes just taking a different path,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.900]   it doesn't actually mean that you're getting
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.520]   a much worse outcome in terms of, in your case,
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.240]   how long it took.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.140]   - Right, okay, so first the story
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.700]   and then how it ties back into what we've been talking about.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.540]   - Okay.
[01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:36.540]   - 'Cause the story's about what happened
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:38.020]   and then how it ties back in
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:42.720]   is about the psychological experience in your mind,
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.020]   not just the physical experience.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.680]   Okay, so the story of what actually happened
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.240]   is when I was living in Santa Monica, California
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.180]   on the beach, there is a bike path
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.540]   that goes through the sand there.
[01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:55.220]   And I think it's 15 miles or something like that.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:58.400]   And for exercise, almost every day,
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.220]   I would at some point stop what I was doing
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:03.760]   and I'd get on my bike and I would do that bike path
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.060]   as fast as I could.
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:07.080]   Like, you know, really like head down
[01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.000]   and kind of like (panting)
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.280]   you know, pushing as hard as I could
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.300]   to like do this in the name of exercise.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.380]   Like I'm gonna do this track.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.620]   And I would do the 15 miles back and forth.
[01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.520]   I don't remember if it was exactly 15 miles,
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.760]   but I do remember that after the first or second time,
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:23.600]   the time it would take me,
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:27.180]   it was almost always exactly 43 minutes.
[01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:29.920]   If it was a really windy day, maybe a little more,
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.160]   but almost never less than 43 minutes.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.300]   So 43 minutes every time.
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.320]   But after doing this for a few months,
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.840]   I realized I was getting less motivated to do it.
[01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.840]   It's like, it's not so much fun,
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:43.080]   this kind of (panting)
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.400]   I always get really red faced.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.500]   It would take me like an hour to cool down afterwards.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.920]   I'd have to take like a cold shower.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.920]   And even then I would like continue sweating
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.200]   even after a cold shower.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.480]   So one day I was just like, I just need to chill.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.440]   I'm just gonna relax and do the same ride,
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:02.020]   but at like half my normal pace.
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:04.120]   So I get on my bike and I'm just like,
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:04.960]   (sighing)
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:05.920]   (humming)
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:07.880]   just going like a granny, you know,
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:10.320]   sitting more upright, you know,
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.960]   looking around and I was just like on my same path.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.440]   And there were dolphins jumping in the ocean that day.
[01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:18.340]   I was like, oh wow, dolphins, that's so bad-ass.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.640]   I grew up in Chicago.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:21.020]   I'm looking at dolphins.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:23.320]   And yes, in the Marina Del Rey,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.020]   I went to under Marina Del Rey,
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.620]   there were a whole bunch of pelicans
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.980]   that were perching on the breakwater thing.
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.200]   And at one point when I rode my bike near them,
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.040]   the pelicans all went,
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:33.880]   (imitating pelican)
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.060]   I was like, whoa, pelicans.
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.400]   Oh, and then like,
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.640]   one of them shit in my mouth.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.720]   It was like the taste of like digested oyster.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.560]   The shells were like,
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.020]   (imitating pelican)
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:47.560]   So that was a really unique experience.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.720]   So then I get back to my starting point
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.680]   where I would always time myself
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:56.680]   and I looked at my watch and it had been 45 minutes.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.240]   I was like, wait a minute, no way.
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.860]   Like I'm usually doing it in 43 minutes.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:03.880]   I thought it would be like an hour and a half.
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.720]   I felt like I was going half speed,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:08.720]   but I guess just because of the strength of my legs
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.680]   or whatever, I was going about the same pace,
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:15.840]   even though it felt like half the effort.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.720]   So that just blew my mind.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:18.800]   And yeah, I double checked.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800]   Yeah, 45 minutes.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.140]   Oh my God.
[01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.100]   So like that became a metaphor
[01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:26.200]   for how you can just relax
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.340]   and put in so much less effort
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.820]   and get almost the same result objectively,
[01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:37.820]   but psychologically you feel so much better about it.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:42.220]   So yeah, full circle to what we're talking about,
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:46.560]   whether it's travel or decision-making,
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.640]   to me the psychological experience
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:52.560]   matters more than anything.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.840]   So yes, I could force my kid
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.200]   to go to the eight things I want to see in Paris
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.000]   and force him to sit next to me at a fancy restaurant
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.280]   that he doesn't like,
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.280]   because damn it, it says that this has the best,
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.240]   you know, creme brulee in Paris.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.360]   And I could make him do this.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:12.360]   And objectively, I could say
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.800]   that might cram in more experiences
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:18.240]   and technically make a better holiday, but guess what?
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:21.800]   The psychological experience of it would be worse
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:24.440]   than if I just book the flight,
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.200]   get there and just let my kid lead the way.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.480]   I might see less stuff,
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.960]   but the psychological experience of it will be better.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.560]   I definitely value and prioritize the psychological,
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.600]   the inner experience of something.
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.900]   - To me, you kind of satisfies the bike ride,
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.360]   which is you didn't try to get the ultimate maximum output
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.200]   from riding it.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.520]   And in return, you actually got the maximum output.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:51.080]   You did, you actually were able to get 99% of the output
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.680]   in terms of physical output,
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.420]   but then you also got to enjoy the bike ride and all that.
[01:32:55.420 --> 01:32:57.320]   And to the Paris example, the funniest part is,
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.600]   to the average untrained American palate,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:03.200]   I am fairly confident that the average creme brulee in Paris
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.960]   is gonna be better than any creme brulee you've had.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:08.880]   So, you know, does it need to be the best croissant
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.760]   or the best creme brulee?
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:13.840]   And I say this as someone who just recently searched for,
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:15.080]   oh, let's go to this bakery.
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.260]   They have the best, this.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.880]   We did have one terrible croissant in Paris,
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.120]   but for the most part,
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:23.240]   the random croissant at any bakery is so good
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.120]   that I would tell you,
[01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.160]   even though I find it hard to take my own advice,
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:31.240]   that don't track to the best one in the world,
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.600]   just track to a good one and like, enjoy that.
[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.360]   And it will probably be a better experience
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.480]   than schlepping the whole family on the Metro
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.880]   to go seven stops early in the morning
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.840]   so you don't have to wait in too long of a line.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.960]   And I say this as advice it's hard for me to take myself,
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.920]   but hopefully the pain I've endured to say it
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.560]   can save people some misery.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.600]   - I have internalized satisficing so much
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.120]   that when I go to a restaurant,
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.240]   and I don't even really care what restaurant I go to,
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:03.400]   I don't even maximize that.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:04.720]   Whatever's nearby, it's fine.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:05.560]   I'm sure it's fine.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.360]   As long as it doesn't completely suck.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.080]   If I see the one with the little flies
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.800]   and the broken fluorescent light, all right,
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.920]   maybe not that one,
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.760]   maybe that one across the street instead.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:15.840]   I can walk into almost any restaurant
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.040]   and my friends tease me for this.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.280]   Here's how I order.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.440]   I flip open the menu and basically the first thing I see
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:23.880]   in the first three seconds, I'm like there,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.720]   I just closed the menu.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.680]   I'm like, that's what I'm having.
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.520]   And they're just like, you didn't look at everything.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.800]   I'm like, I don't need to look at everything.
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.400]   I'm just gonna eat something and it's gonna be fine.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:34.760]   Like I don't even need to order the best thing on the menu.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.240]   Just whatever.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.000]   Or if I don't even feel like looking at the menu
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.560]   and the waiter comes by early,
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:41.640]   I'll just say, what's your best thing?
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.480]   Or what do you recommend?
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.520]   What's your most popular dish?
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:46.320]   And he'll say, oh, the whatever, the chili.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.120]   Like, yeah, give me that then.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.880]   Like I don't even look at the menu sometimes.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:54.080]   I really, really deeply internalized the lessons
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.400]   from the Paradox of Choice book.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.680]   - Well, I'm gonna recommend everyone check out
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.840]   both the writings you've had,
[01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:02.240]   the books you've written and that book.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.160]   The one thing, I haven't done this as frequently
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.560]   as I wanted to, but I ask people,
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.240]   because everyone here likes to travel,
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.880]   is there a place, and I'm hoping that you use somewhere
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.560]   in New Zealand since I've been dying for an excuse to go,
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:15.280]   that you're familiar with enough,
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.800]   feel free to choose anywhere in the world,
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.120]   that if someone were heading there,
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:22.120]   you'd recommend a couple of places that are your favorite
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:22.960]   anywhere in the world.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.000]   - Let me start with a do not do in New Zealand.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.760]   If you come to New Zealand,
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:31.120]   do not spend a single minute in any city.
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:32.360]   New Zealand is not Europe.
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:37.040]   In Europe, the cities contain the culture of the place.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.960]   In New Zealand, the cities are just dumb generic cities.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.440]   There is nothing special about any city in New Zealand.
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:44.120]   Everything that's wonderful about New Zealand
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.760]   is contained in the rural nature countryside
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.000]   or in the cute, small, little towns.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.080]   So what you must do when you come to New Zealand
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.400]   is just rent a car,
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.440]   whether you rent a car at the Auckland Airport
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:00.800]   and drive south or connect to Christchurch
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:02.480]   and just rent a car at the Christchurch Airport
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.720]   and drive west, just drive away from the city.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.160]   Don't spend a single minute in any city in New Zealand.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.960]   Okay, so that's number one.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:13.040]   What to do, honestly, I'm just gonna leave this open.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:17.000]   I think the best thing to do then is rent a car,
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.880]   install the booking.com app on your phone
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.600]   because every single motel in New Zealand,
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.960]   and there are hundreds,
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.840]   maybe thousands of these cute little motels,
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.080]   they're all on this app
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:30.960]   and it will show you your immediate availability.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.520]   So you can just be impulsive.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:35.880]   You don't even need to book everything in advance.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.720]   You can just go on a drive and see what looks appealing
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   and say like, "What's that over there?
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.360]   "Let's just go there."
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:43.920]   And then when it's getting late afternoon
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.240]   and you're feeling like it's time to pick
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.320]   where you're gonna stay,
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.200]   you just open the app with the GPS and it says like,
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.240]   "Okay, here's the six motels in your area
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.400]   "that have availability," and you just pick one.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.440]   And they're all good.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.480]   My favorite road trips in New Zealand
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.840]   have been through this method with no plan.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.960]   I just go to a certain direction
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.640]   and the whole country is so safe
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.760]   and the people are so nice
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:05.600]   and there are plenty of motels
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:09.840]   and that's more than telling you one destination to go to.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:10.680]   It's that.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.200]   But lastly, if I had to pick just one,
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.720]   if you've got little kids,
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.320]   one hour north of Wellington,
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:22.320]   there is a very special place called Staglands,
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.720]   S-T-A-G-L-A-N-D-S.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:28.480]   It is an open like petting zoo kind of thing.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.280]   The animals are not in cages,
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:31.760]   they're just roaming around
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.520]   and all of the animals will eat out of your hand
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.880]   and you can just go up to,
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.360]   whether it's like deer or birds or peacocks,
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.120]   geese, little pigs,
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.560]   yeah, everything will eat out of your hand
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:44.440]   and you just like pet them
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.480]   and you're just surrounded in this wonderful like valley
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:48.960]   full of animals.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.520]   And especially if you get to go on a weekday,
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.880]   you'll be one of the only people there.
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.360]   It's just, it's a really, really, really special place.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.880]   So there's my secret hidden recommendation.
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.720]   But actually, you know what?
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.720]   Anybody, if you're coming to New Zealand, email me
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.080]   and I'll give you more examples.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.120]   Go to my website, you click contact
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.400]   and there's my email address.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:07.800]   I really enjoy my open inbox.
[01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.280]   The reason I do interviews like this
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:10.880]   is because of the people I meet,
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.640]   the people who listen to these things.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:15.480]   And come on, if you've heard my voice for an hour and a half,
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.720]   then send me an email, say hello, introduce yourself.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.000]   And if you're coming to New Zealand,
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.560]   definitely let me know
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:23.520]   and I'll give you more detailed tips.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:25.200]   'Cause I've been here for 10 years now
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.960]   and I know most of the secret places.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:29.880]   - It's on our list.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.720]   We have kids.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.120]   Staglands will be on the list as well.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.320]   This has been so much fun.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.400]   I'm sure we could go longer,
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.600]   but I would love to wrap up and just say,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.480]   is there any final place you'd like people to check out
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:43.800]   or anywhere you'd like to send them before we go?
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.360]   - I really like hearing from strangers.
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.640]   I really enjoy it when people introduce themselves.
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.880]   It's like a deepest sense of joy to me
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.040]   to know people from around the world.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.240]   So yeah, any fans of Chris's all the hacks,
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.400]   go send me an email, go to my website, sive.rs.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:02.440]   And you don't even have to ask me a question,
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.600]   just introduce yourself and say hi.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.440]   - That's awesome.
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.240]   Well, I know you enjoy email and you respond
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.040]   because that's how this all started.
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.840]   So I'm so glad we got to do it.

[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.680]   (electronic music)
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.300]   (electronic music fades)
