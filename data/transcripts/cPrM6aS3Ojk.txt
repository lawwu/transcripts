[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660]   Okay, a number of years ago, Jack asked if he and Bill Bernstein could have an informal
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.480]   non-political chat as part of the agenda.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.920]   And we all know what Jack wants, Jack gets.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.800]   It's become a regular part of our conference agenda ever since, and it's now affectionately
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.080]   known as the Fireside Chat.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.120]   Jack's companion for this Fireside Chat is a retired neurologist who helped co-found
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.960]   Efficient Frontier Advisors.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.340]   He's written a number of best-selling titles on both finance and economic history.
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.840]   He holds both a PhD in chemistry and an MD.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:52.320]   Please welcome one of the smartest guys I know, Dr. Bill Bernstein.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.280]   And the disclaimer that I always have to say, Jack and Bill, the Bogaheads community is
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.800]   a politics-free group, and we respectfully request that you honor that and refrain from
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.640]   discussing anything political.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700]   Other than that, the floor is all yours.
[00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700]   Take it away, Bill.
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700]   Okay.
[00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.700]   Well, thanks.
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.160]   I guess I mumble so badly that I get two microphones.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   The first thing I wanted to bring up is just a segue from your comments, Jack, about Fidelity's
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.440]   zero expense ratio funds.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.120]   When I first read about them, the thing that came immediately to my mind was one of the
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.580]   most notorious tech funds of the late '90s, a company called eMachines, and their business
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.120]   model was giving away computers for free so they could advertise and make money on the
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   advertising, and it seems to me that's what Fidelity is doing as well.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.280]   And the question is, is how do you really think that's going to play out for Fidelity?
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   Well, I think it's going to draw a lot of business.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.920]   The advertising is pretty blunt, it's pretty clear who they're taking aim at.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.640]   When we see our name and when we see Vanguard in big capital letters, bold-faced, you can't
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.360]   have any doubt about the name of the game they're playing, and it's a tough game.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560]   I get letters from people saying, "You always told me to buy the lowest cost index fund.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.160]   What do I do now?"
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.640]   And it's a perfectly good question, and the answer is a little complex.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   I'm not sure.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280]   I have no idea, actually, what Vanguard is going to do in response.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.360]   I have some things that I would think would be well done in response, working on larger
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   accounts.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   But we are, as I think everybody understands, we are in kind of a box, because if we did
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.240]   our index funds at no cost, which is an option always available to us, they will be obviously
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   subsidized by the Wellington Fund shareholders and the Prime Cap Fund shareholders, the shareholders
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.800]   of all our actively managed funds, and the shareholders of all our other index funds.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.760]   If we did just the S&P 500, and they don't, actually, Fidelity's fund is not an S&P 500
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.600]   fund, the big one, the one they're working on.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.520]   And I think the reason for that is that if they use an S&P 500, S&P gets away with murder
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.560]   and would probably be charging one basis point just for using their name.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.100]   And when you want to be a zero, one basis point is a killer.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.840]   But there is an issue of implementation.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   What have we really got here?
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.960]   They have their own indexes.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Will it do better than the S&P?
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   I have no idea.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I'm not saying it won't.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.640]   It might do better sometimes, worse others, that's the most likely scenario.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   So I would just regard it as very tough competition.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.360]   And as I think I said in my remarks earlier, it's what I would do if I were Fidelity.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.000]   You know, they're out of the game, get in the game with a bang, and become one of the
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.320]   big four and now the big three.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.120]   And that's their goal, although one wonders a little bit why it's their goal.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.360]   I mean, they've got this immensely profitable company doing everything else.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.080]   And I think it's just to preserve their mutual fund business, which is probably, I'm guessing
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.440]   here, 25% of their total revenues.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.800]   I'm not sure exactly.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.760]   And I'm not sure exactly, I'm really just venturing a total guess.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   So they're doing it.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.580]   I hope nobody is, in retrospect, you know, moves $3 million over and tells me that they're
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.040]   saving $10,000 a year or $6,000 a year, something like that, and then gets their tax bill for
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   selling the Vanguard fund at $3 million and paying $200,000, well, I don't know what it
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.280]   would be, a couple hundred thousand dollars anyway of taxes, which would eat up that income.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   But we feel it now.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.840]   I mean, I don't have the data for you, but we see it in our own data, that Fidelity is
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.760]   making a pretty big splash here.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   And we'll have more.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.360]   They just did this in August, I think.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.920]   And so we have the August data and the data I showed you, but we'll have September, which
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   will be very revealing.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.480]   There'll be a trend there.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.320]   There'll be October and the data will come in.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.760]   Vanguard has the data for Vanguard for all these periods.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.480]   I do not, and that's fine.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   I don't need it.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.880]   I'm just reporting what is, and we will find that out.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.080]   But you never know where the next competitive threat is going to come from.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200]   And everybody, we know who everybody is shooting at.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.080]   Everybody in this business is shooting at, and they're all, all of you here in this
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:52.240]   room, they're shooting at the Bogleheads, that's who, and the big Bogle himself, and
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.720]   -- at least some of the time.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.680]   So I don't see that there's a good competitive, a really good competitive response.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.680]   I don't think there's a winning competitive response.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.440]   There may be an ameliorating competitive response, and I think there is, but that's up to Vanguard.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.720]   I think that it might behoove Vanguard to point out to members of the fourth estate
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.680]   how generous the owners of Fidelity's active funds are for subsidizing the zero expense
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680]   funds.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:35.760]   Well, there's a lot of that going on, subsidization, and actually, and I tell this story, it's
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.720]   one of the landmarks in my book, and it made it possible for us to be a competitor in this
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.360]   business seven or eight years ago, 1993, I think it was, actually, more than that, fifteen
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.720]   years ago, because we had a very proscribed formula, set up a series of formulas, telling
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.600]   us in our original service agreement that established Vanguard how to allocate expenses
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.520]   between all of the funds in the group, and it was very formal, like number of shareholders,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.760]   number of transactions, executive time, that would be something you just allocate, and
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.080]   direct and indirect expenses, classic, for doing that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.880]   I could see that we were in a box, because we were starting to have price competition.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.640]   We had cost competition.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:32.000]   We knew what the costs were, and so I put in a proxy, we put in a proxy, giving us the
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.660]   right to match competition in our pricing for the funds, to use that as another indication.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.000]   We kept the original standards, cost allocation standards, so that we could also consider
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.780]   meeting competition, meeting competitive prices, so that's enabled us to do what we've done,
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.660]   but I don't think anybody's going to want to, I hope not, by the way, anybody's going
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:00.220]   to want to go to zero on new investments in our funds, because it would be so apparent
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.680]   somebody else was doing just what you say, Bill, subsidizing the fund, and there's going
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.900]   to be a little bit of that no matter what you do, and you never know who's subsidizing
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.160]   it, but we do the best job on that, we can, and are still able to compete.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.160]   Okay, well, I want to shift gears now and talk about the much bigger picture.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.680]   We try to stay away from macroeconomics, because speculating about it doesn't really do the
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.920]   average investor much good, but there's some things that are out there that I think that
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.100]   are of great concern.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.320]   Because of the recent tax cuts, the federal deficit is going to approach about a trillion
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.080]   dollars, there's already almost 22 trillion in outstanding treasury debt out there, on
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.440]   which the interest, the current servicing costs, are only 276 billion dollars a year.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:55.120]   If you do the math, that means that Uncle Sam is financing his debt at 1.3%.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.680]   That is going to be changing very rapidly.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.200]   The good news is that the term of that is about six years or so, the average term of
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.220]   that debt, so it's going to take a while for the ottoman to hit the fan.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.720]   But the bad news is that when it does, it's not going to be very pretty.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.460]   If servicing costs go up to the historical range of 6% treasury debt, which is, six year
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.480]   treasury debt, which is around 5%, that puts the servicing costs at a trillion dollars
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   a year, out of federal tax receipts of about 3.4 trillion a year.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.480]   So do you think that's of concern?
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:42.600]   And that's even before we get to the issue of corporate debt, which is also becoming
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:48.360]   very frothy and very covenant light out of control as well.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.240]   So during the next downturn, corporations are not going to have a walk in the park either
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.360]   servicing their debt.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:03.040]   So do you worry at all, do you think that's of concern to the people in this audience?
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   We used to say, people used to ask me, "What keeps you awake at night?"
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:14.440]   And my answer would be the same now, Bill, as it has always been, "Nothing."
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.120]   If staying awake all night would help solve the problem, by God, I'll stay awake all
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120]   night.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:28.560]   But let me, your question is much more serious than that, and I believe we're going to
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.600]   have a trillion dollar deficit this fiscal year, that would be the 2019 fiscal year,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.880]   a trillion dollar deficit.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:45.960]   And I won't get into politics, I hope this isn't politics, but let me just say that giving
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:56.280]   a $10 trillion, I think it is, over time, tax cut to businesses, and a $5 trillion,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:03.440]   I can't remember the numbers, but say $100 billion tax cut to corporations, and a $5
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.960]   billion tax increase to individuals, which is what's happening over time, say the next
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.820]   decade, verges on economic insanity.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:23.240]   And I'm tempted to say political brilliance, but I won't say that.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:33.800]   So I look at it as, let me go back a little further, and say almost every bubble that
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:41.760]   we've had in the history of the world has been brought about by debt.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.320]   And our debt in the United States is out of control.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.440]   I mean, it's in control, but nobody pays any attention to it.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.720]   And I don't want to get into politics, but it is amusing to think that the Republicans
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.520]   of fiscal hawks have been the ones responsible for this.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.640]   That's not necessarily for or against it, but it is interesting to see that they're
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:09.520]   total, in the face of political reality, have given away on economic reality.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.060]   So we have high consumer debt, we have not particularly high automobile debt, high credit
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.920]   card debt, and the whole new, you probably know this.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:27.040]   The biggest single piece of debt in this country, by far, is student loans.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.640]   And can they all be paid off?
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.160]   How can they possibly be paid off?
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.080]   I mean, it was a bad deal in the beginning to suggest, particularly from the private
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   colleges, that you go here and you'll be able to make so much money that we can charge
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.760]   you a lot, and you'll go out in the world and make a lot of money.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.520]   It isn't that easy.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   There are only so many good jobs in America, good, high-paying jobs.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.480]   And so you put all that debt together, there's still a lot of mortgage debt, there's still
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.600]   home equity debt.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.520]   There's debt sort of everywhere.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:06.800]   And I think that is where the next crisis, if it comes, and it probably will, I have
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   no idea when, is going to be the basis for that.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.280]   Too much borrowing.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:22.840]   Well, that segues into another subject, which is, you mentioned the B-word, bubble, and
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.920]   debt, quite accurately identified that as the source throughout history, over the past
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.120]   several centuries of bubbles, is what positive, there's the negative signs, which is the underlying
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.480]   condition, the amount of debt that's eventually going to have to be liquidated.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.200]   Do you see any positive signs of bubbles out there, any behavioral signs of bubbles that
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   worry you at all?
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.440]   I mean, Bitcoin, for example, Bitcoin, there's no question that there were the behavioral
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   signs.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.920]   Do you see any behavioral issues out there among investors that point to a bubble?
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:02.360]   Well, you know, that's really an interesting point, and I can't avoid a political, I guess,
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.240]   it's an economic comment, but also a political comment.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.440]   Everything that is happening today is great for the short term, and terrible for the long
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   term.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.640]   And I'm not only talking about the fiscal situation, but I'm talking about, and these
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.840]   issues are really important, the gap between, the incredible gap between the wealthiest
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.200]   fraction, wealthiest 1% of America and everybody else, and particularly the lowest 15%, and
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   I'm talking about an attenuation, acceleration of the gap between white and black, which
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.760]   is clearly there.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   You know, immigration built this country, and if you don't believe that, look in your
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:49.320]   own family trees, my traceable in-laws, grandparents, great-grandparents, come off the boat from
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:56.840]   Scotland in 1866, so I'm a child of immigrants, or a grandchild, and to stamp on immigration,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:03.000]   what's been such a force for good in the country, all these things, and they're less tangible.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.080]   It doesn't matter a heck of a lot on any of those issues, those broad social issues.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   But in the long run, it makes all the difference in the world.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.140]   So what does that say?
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:20.000]   We have, Bill, a market focused on the short term, with a prayer that everything will be
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.200]   all right.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.800]   And I haven't even gotten into climate change.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.880]   I got here in Philadelphia, where every day we're 10 degrees above normal, and this is
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880]   only one season.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:35.360]   And then I read that the administration, this is not a political comment, happily, the administration
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:44.840]   predicts that the temperature of the world by 2100 will be 10 degrees higher than it
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   is today.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.680]   No, I'm sorry, 7 degrees higher than it is today.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:57.720]   Just imagine what that's going to do to everything that we think about and do, and leave aside
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.240]   the upheaval in the climate that we're getting even now, the bigger hurricanes, the bigger
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.880]   rainstorms, and all that.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.840]   So we're really on dangerous ground, and yet the market goes blithely along.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.640]   And I do, in a sense, worry about that.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:23.560]   As I tell people, I've been for quite a few years around 50/50 stocks and bonds, and I
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.600]   spend half of my time wondering why the heck I have so much in stocks, and the other half
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.080]   wondering about why I have so little.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.760]   This is the investor's dilemma.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.760]   By the way, that's one of the metrics I use to identify a proper stock/bond allocation
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:46.440]   is that you spend an equal amount of time regretting having too much or too little.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.040]   You've got the perfect allocation.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:57.640]   Let the record show that I'm really doing my best here to stay away from politics.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.200]   On to another subject which is completely non-political.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:12.320]   Over the past 40 or 50 years, the percent of GDP being paid to workers as salary has
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:19.640]   decreased from 52% to 42%, which is huge.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.560]   Where is that extra income going?
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:32.480]   Well, it's going to us in this room, and the balance on the other side of the balance is
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.080]   that it's not going to people who are working for us.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:44.480]   And so the question is, is that something that you worry about simply as an equity holder?
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   Concerned about it.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   Nothing keeps me awake.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.700]   But of course that's a problem.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.680]   It's fine to say that we should avoid political problems and political issues, but there's
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.640]   no divorcing political issues from economic issues and from social issues.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   They're all part of what constitutes the United States of America and her role in the
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.120]   world.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.320]   You can see that shrinking.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.960]   You can see China rising.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.360]   I'm not sure what that means, but it doesn't mean anything good when they start taking
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:24.680]   over islands in the Sea of China, so-called, and the Sea of the Philippines and building
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.600]   little tiny reefs in the huge airports.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   It must take a lot of sand to do that.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.680]   Competition in the world, America's place in the world, is threatened.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.840]   It doesn't have to be given up.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   But what we're doing now is taking the nation away from its, what's the phrase they use,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:57.520]   American tradition or the uniqueness of America.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.960]   And that's been our biggest asset.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.120]   Where does everybody want to go in the world when they're not in the U.S.?
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.440]   They want to go to the U.S.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.640]   That's a good sign, and I recognize you can't take as many immigrants as you might like
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.040]   to take.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.400]   But they're all bound up, I think, Bill, in one part covered by your question, and the
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.280]   part goes even beyond that, into one big issue, and that is what kind of a country do we want
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.040]   this to be?
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.800]   And I want it to be a better country than it is.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.640]   I think it was a better country than it is.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.920]   And I tell people, this is a political statement, but it falls both ways.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.000]   I consider myself an extreme conservative.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.200]   I love the country, I love our institutions, I love our entrepreneurship, I love our ability
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:53.200]   to do what we want, liberty, if you want to call it that, and I want to keep those things
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.800]   as much as we can.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.080]   But I all of a sudden become a liberal to say that to keep those things, we have to
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.640]   make sure that the people in America who are not here in this room get well taken care
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.540]   of.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:13.880]   The underclass of America is large, average income $15,000 a year, I think.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.040]   Imagine that, anyone in the room, imagine that.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.560]   So I guess the phrase I was searching for before was American exceptionalism.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:30.040]   We're starting to lose that, and so I become so conservative that I want to be liberal
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:36.440]   enough to handle all of those who are not in the most favored places in America.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.380]   Well I don't think there's any way of spinning this next question politically, so I'll ask
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:48.000]   it, which is that if you look at the number of publicly traded companies in the United
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.960]   States, around 1970 there were 8,000 publicly traded companies, now there's 4,000.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.360]   And so that raises several issues.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.960]   Number one is, why do you think that it's happening?
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.460]   Is it all the fault of Sarbanes-Oxley?
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.040]   Is it the rise of private capital as a source of funding, you don't need public capital
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   anymore?
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   Are there other reasons?
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:21.560]   And then the second part of the question is, what does that mean for the people in this
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   room?
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.280]   I mean, the number of publicly traded companies that we can invest in is slowly shrinking.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.200]   Well, first that's the data.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.240]   I think the data are somewhat worse than you say, because I think the number of public
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.840]   companies remaining is more like 2,800 or 3,000 as compared to 4,000.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.240]   But I'd also note that that 8,000 was probably--I don't have the data firmly in mind--was probably
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   a very high point.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.760]   In other words, when we got into the late 2000s, an awful lot of new companies came
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   in.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.360]   And probably the fairest comparison is we used to have an index called the Wilshire
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.360]   5,000.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.240]   So we're now, I would say, the best baseline is 5,000.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.520]   And we're now down to 3,000, let me say.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.840]   So the shrinkage is large, but not quite as large as it's failed to be.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:21.840]   Second, if you look at the data, almost all the companies that are leaving are very small
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.440]   companies, small and very small.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.240]   And they--some of them, I guess, don't like to have to register with it or file information
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   with the government.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.040]   I think that's a very small part of it.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.800]   Some of them just didn't make it.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:42.920]   You know, in these boom years that led up to the market peak in 2000, the companies
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.780]   blossomed and then went away, a lot of tech companies.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.800]   So I don't think it's as serious an issue as you say, but I do think it's a very serious
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   issue.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.480]   And, you know, I kind of wonder when I see one more damn merger--darn merger after another.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:06.840]   And I think when we see a lot of that, I wonder, why are we doing this?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.880]   Why does national policy allow all these mergers?
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.480]   Teddy Roosevelt would have been out there with a shotgun.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:23.440]   And he's my classic Republican, if that's--I hope that's not a political comment.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.000]   I mean, he'd been dead a long time now.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.120]   And so I worry--I'm concerned about it.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.000]   But more than that, the underlying reasons that we allow companies to get bigger and
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.560]   bigger and bigger as a matter of apparent national policy is, I think, the wrong way
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   to be going.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.760]   I think we ought to be much stiffer in antitrust, much stiffer in everything we do to make these
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.560]   things--and much stricter even, Bill, much stricter in accounting.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.640]   You know, how many mergers are done just to muddy up the figures?
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.680]   You know, you can do whatever you want when you read pro forma 99.5 percent of the time.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   Not all the time.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.400]   When you read pro forma, boy, put your hand over your wad.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.480]   Somebody's playing games with the numbers.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.120]   And that's an important part of all this.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:26.360]   And the synergies--we're going to make it up with synergies.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:30.080]   Those synergies are always talked about and almost never realized.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.560]   This is savings, because you don't need two chief financial officers, blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.320]   And they just don't seem to materialize.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.840]   So I'm unhappy with it.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.200]   I hope it won't go any further.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.080]   And there must be some limit, because you may only have to own one stock to have the
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.520]   S&P 500, which I would think would be very bad.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.760]   Okay.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:59.600]   Well, it's, you know, it's 2018, so you have to ask the decadal question.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.000]   I can remember almost 10 years ago to the date we were all together and we were in San
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.280]   Diego and you were talking about the collapse of Lehman.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.520]   I remember that your voice rose about two or three octaves when you simply said the
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.880]   word.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:27.960]   And do you think we're in a better place, a worse place now?
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.640]   I think I know what the answer is, but I want to hear what you think.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.800]   Well, I think we're in a better place now than we were in 2008, because the particular
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.420]   debt was financial debt and mortgage debt.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:46.040]   And then the creation of these idiotic, for want of a better word, mortgage certificates,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:54.000]   mortgage-backed certificates, which mortgages, which had no value, made money for the people
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.040]   that gave them the money, made money for the people that were buying houses.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.800]   They gave them the best deals possible, even more than the value of the house.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.740]   And then they sell them, and then they sell them to somebody else and they're put into
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.560]   a certificate and everybody forgot that there were people at the bottom of the pile that
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.120]   could not possibly pay their mortgage debt.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.800]   And that is not happening now.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.040]   I'm not saying there's none of it, but that is not the excessive thing and not the
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.000]   junk thing.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.960]   So I do think we're in a better place now, but not a lot better place, and the market
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.800]   is telling us we're in a lot better place.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.760]   I think that's right.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.560]   I think that in some ways we're in a worse place, because we had relatively high interest
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.960]   rates and five big banks that couldn't fail.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.600]   Now we've got much lower interest rates to start from, and we've got four big banks
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:55.080]   that are too big to fail, that are managing a higher percentage of financial assets.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:27:04.360]   But on the other hand, as you point out, the epicenter of the debt crisis in 2008 was real
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360]   estate.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.540]   If the value of stocks falls by half, that's owned by maybe 10% of rich people and their
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.960]   net value, their net worth goes down by 50%.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.840]   It's not that big of a deal in terms of the overall economy.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:23.280]   But if 25% of the population owns an underwater house, that really does affect spending, and
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.200]   I think that's why what happened back then was so catastrophic and isn't likely to happen
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   now.
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.580]   All right, well, one last question.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:42.400]   I don't think that it's political to observe that there's been a decrease in the comedy
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.560]   of public discourse in this country.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.680]   It would be political to try and blame someone.
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:53.000]   I wouldn't dare ever do that.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.320]   And so the question is, what do you think are the limited implications for investors,
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:06.920]   and do you think that it's a problem in the larger political sense of our country that
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:14.500]   is going to heal itself and mend itself at some point?
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.440]   And answer this in non-political terms.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   Absolutely.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Yes.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   Yes.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.880]   So I certainly won't talk about fake news.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.280]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:35.200]   I think it's tragic the way the power of the press has been more or less subverted to a
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.860]   certain number of people anyway, and told you don't need to pay any attention to them.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:43.580]   Please listen to me.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.580]   Listen to the Internet, you would think, with the Russian interference, obviously, the interference
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.520]   in the last election campaign.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:54.320]   People would now become aware that the Internet is talking about the medium for fake news.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:02.040]   I mean, it's an outrage, and the loss of our privacy is an outrage.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.400]   But particularly the idea that what you're seeing there on your little computer, if you
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.480]   do these old "I don't do this" stuff, all this texting, or, you know, "What does that
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.320]   number sign mean?
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   Call this number?"
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   Cashmark.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   Cashmark.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Cashmark.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:28.720]   I don't even know what it means, but I think it says, "You better get over here quick."
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.240]   So I don't do that.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:37.160]   And the press in the United States has been singularly responsible.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.800]   Not always, not all newspapers, and now they're vilified.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:49.420]   And the people that believe they're vilified, Cadre that believe they're vilified, is large.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:55.580]   And they've been vetted, they've had editors going over it, they have fact-checkers, my
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:01.840]   God you wouldn't believe the fact-checkers, finest little things in the world, and they're
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.000]   giving us what I believe is the straight story of America today.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.640]   And to disown that gives us a feeling that all is well, and I would say all is not well.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.440]   There's so much going on that's important to the country, and we spend so much time
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:25.680]   on trivia and little tiny things, and I won't get into the Supreme Court thing, I mean the
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.560]   implications of that are of course much more than trivia, the person on the Supreme Court
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.920]   was conservative-leaning.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:38.800]   But the issue, you know, we'll resolve these issues eventually, but only if we can wake
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:45.720]   up people to vote, number one, to vote, because the absentee voting, the voters that don't
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:52.880]   show up, registered voters who don't vote, is shocking, and the whole underlying strength
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.560]   of democracy is to have everybody vote, and believe me if everybody votes we have a very
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.120]   different kind of America.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.800]   So I worry about, by the way Bill, the money involved in the electoral process, the fact
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:14.400]   these, I saw Sheldon Adelson has devoted $100 million to the coming campaign, he's a big
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:24.480]   Las Vegas something, Macau, he owns gambling joints, I'm sorry, gambling establishments,
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:31.720]   all over the world, and he's my idea of a fraud, God knows how many people got paid
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:37.520]   off to get a franchise in Macau, or even for that matter in Las Vegas, and yet he's regarded
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:43.560]   by Forbes as a great businessman, I'm sorry to be in his company by the way, they regarded
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.360]   me that way, I may not be much, but I'm more of a businessman than he is, talking about
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:51.080]   damning with fake praise.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:32:02.720]   So no, these are big issues, and soft issues, and divisive issues, and you know, I'm a little
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:09.760]   bit reminded, this anecdote is in the book, in a section called Presidents, I talk about
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.000]   the presidents that I've met, briefly mostly, and the one I talk a little bit more about
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.840]   is that I was invited to dinner at the White House in May of 1970, and the stock market
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.720]   was falling apart, and some genius in the White House PR staff decides that it would
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:33.080]   help investor confidence, they asked about 25 or 30 people like me, heads of financial
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:40.560]   institutions, which I was then, and I guess still am, no I'm not still, but to the White
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.560]   House for dinner.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:48.640]   I got off the train in Washington, dial up 40%, I'm sorry 400 points, or 40 points or
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.200]   something big for that day, on news of meeting, the fact that these people like me are by
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.240]   the way a pretty ordinary crowd, had anything to do with getting the stock market up, I
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   don't know.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:05.120]   So we go to dinner with the president, and it was in the state dining room, and this
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:12.240]   little square table, and right across from me is that brooding portrait of Abraham Lincoln,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.640]   and right below him is Richard Nixon.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:23.160]   And so he gets up and he had all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Council of Economic Advisers,
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:30.920]   all those people talk to us, and then he said, "Are there any questions?"
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:38.960]   Nobody stood up, not one person in that room, and I thought after a moment's hesitation,
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.520]   the hell with it.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.200]   So I stood up, and this part of the question is very relevant for today.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.640]   I said, "Mr. President, you reassured us all about our military strength, and how well
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.680]   we're doing in Vietnam, how well we're doing in Vietnam."
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.180]   He did reassure us of that, and how the Federal Reserve will fill its usual role of lender
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:06.680]   at last resort, and the economy is doing well, and so on.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.840]   But you haven't touched on the issue that I think is really the responsible for what
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.000]   is dividing America today.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.400]   In view of your campaign pledge to bring us all together, what are you going to do about
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   it?
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:34.720]   The silence could be cut with a knife, and he looked first angry, and first astonished
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.200]   that this investment group would even be thinking about bringing us all together.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.080]   I think annoyed that that was the first and it turned out to be almost the only question
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.460]   he got, and something he didn't really want to deal with.
[00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.480]   He really looked like someone had hit him in the face with a wet washcloth, but he did
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   try and answer it.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.080]   He appointed Chancellor Herd of Vanderbilt to head a commission on looking at the divisions
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.280]   in the schools, things of that nature, and so he gave a kind of a fumbling answer, but
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.040]   he clearly was not happy with it.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   "Well, he was there, and I was here, so when you go out the door that's there, have
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   you figured it out yet?
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.760]   We're going to be in the same place?"
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.960]   So I walked out the door right next to President Nixon, and I said, "You know, I hope you
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.440]   didn't think my question was rude."
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.000]   "Oh, no, no, no," he said, "that was exactly the right question, and that's why
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.720]   I'm doing what I'm doing," or something like that, something very lukewarm.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:36.800]   But the divisions in this country, we should be united on so many things, and we are not
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.560]   united today.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:45.720]   And so I think we have to face up to that fact and do what we can as citizens, and we
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.820]   sit in this room and we'll do like I wrote about the universe, what I wrote about the
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   universe.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.880]   You know, it's so big and we're so small, but that doesn't mean that one person doesn't
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.680]   make a difference.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.840]   So I think we have to try and do better as individuals, and I've tried to do better
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.320]   not as an individual, but in a corporate sense, try to contribute something to the world,
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   and something to make America better, spread stock ownership among people who get a fair
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.320]   shake.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:22.080]   This is a crusade, and it was so easy, because they were getting such a lousy shake before.
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.760]   So that's too much rambling, and I think you've heard quite enough from me today.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   Okay.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   Well, that was fun.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.720]   I think we better give it back to Mel before his hair catches on fire.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.720]   Thank you, Jack and Bill.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.520]   We're going to take a...
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.520]   [Applause]
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
