[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   So I wrote a book 10 years ago where I was trying to figure out as part of it how do
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.720]   people get better at things.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   And so I spent time with a professional guitar player and said, "I just wanted to see how
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   he practiced.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.720]   Like, what does this actually look like?"
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.160]   And what I learned from them is, like, what they do is, yeah, they have the music in front
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   of them, but for them it's all speed.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.640]   So they take a piece—he was working on licks for—he was a new acoustic style player,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   and he had these kind of bluegrass-y type licks, and he probably had it memorized.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.040]   And he knew how fast he could comfortably play it.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.360]   For them, it's all about adding 20 percent to what they're comfortably doing, and then
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.920]   that push past where they're comfortable.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.960]   And the thing I remember writing about him was he was concentrating so hard to try to
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.340]   hit this lick 20 percent faster than he was used to it, he'd forget to breathe.
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.600]   So he'd be, like, going, going, going, and then just gasp, you know, because his body
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.920]   would force him to breathe.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.840]   So yeah, there it seemed to be all about deliberate practice.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.720]   So, like, how do you—they don't waste any time—professional musicians waste no time
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.940]   doing things they're comfortable doing.
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.400]   Every time they spend practicing—and this is also incredibly difficult—but every time
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.680]   they spend practicing, it's almost entirely in a state of, "I'm not comfortable with
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   this, but if I focus as hard as I can, maybe I'm going to pull this off.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.040]   Like, I'll pull off the sonata at this new speed I'm trying to do.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   Maybe I'll pull it off."
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.240]   It's, like, the maximal growth-stimulating state.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.160]   And so I wrote in this chapter, "Why was he so much better at guitar than I was at
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160]   the same age?"
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.200]   Because I played a lot of guitar when I was younger and was in rock bands, right?
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.480]   And this kid was young, right?
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480]   But really, really good.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.360]   And I said, "Okay, now I realize it.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.000]   I can recognize me when I look back at my time playing guitar at his age.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   I played stuff I knew how to play.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   Like, that's what was fun.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.600]   Like, yeah, I want to, like, jam along with the songs I knew or, you know, rip some pentatonic
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.760]   scales, you know, to, like, a Jimi Hendrix album."
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.200]   It was fun.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.440]   And he spent almost no time, the pro spent no time having fun.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.080]   Practicing was, your brain had to be, you know, uncomfortable.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.440]   So I learned a lot from that, you know?
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.720]   This actually led to a bit of a battle because of my readers, there was this battle that
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.200]   emerged where people were trying to combine Anders Ericsson and deliberate practice with
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.160]   Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and flow.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.880]   And really, they were trying to make flow apply everywhere.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   Like, it's all about flow, deliberate practice is flow, everything is flow.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.760]   The whole thing is to get into a state of flow.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720]   And I remember Anders talking about this at some point and saying, like, "No, no, no.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.320]   Like, the state of practice that makes you better, it's the opposite of flow, right?
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   In flow, you lose track of time.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   When you're practicing like that professional guitar player, you know every second that
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720]   passes by because it's, like, incredibly difficult.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.400]   Like, what you're doing, your mind is rebelling.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.400]   It's not natural.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.860]   You know, it's not fun.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's not the skier going down the hill and it's all instinct.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   It's all you thinking about exactly what you're trying to do."
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.480]   And so, you know, I began to push this point out here, it's like, it's not all about flow.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.560]   Like, actually getting better at things is really painful sometimes.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   Deliberate practice is not the same as flow.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.560]   And there was a lot of fights about this for a while.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.960]   I think there was a lot of flow advocates that just wanted life to be flow all the time.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   But I think Anders was right because I watched these professionals practice, like, that's
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   what it is.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   It's not fun.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.720]   So everything we know about neuroplasticity, which of course is the nervous system's ability
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.860]   to change in response to experience, says that there needs to be some neurochemical
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.880]   or electrical condition that changes in the nervous system in order to cue up plasticity.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.920]   And to my knowledge, one of the most robust of those is the release of the so-called catecholamines,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.240]   dopamine epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.320]   And because it's involved in so many things, it can be a little bit of a distractor.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.880]   So let's just say epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, create in the body
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.200]   and mind to some extent a state of alertness and often a state of agitation.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.320]   But if you think about it, in the absence of some neuromodulators like those that change
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.160]   the conditions for wiring of neurons, you know, everyone loves fire together, wire together.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.080]   A beautiful statement by Carla Schatz, not Donald Hebb, Dr. Carla Schatz said that, not
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.840]   Donald Hebb.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.240]   But why would neurons need to change their patterns of connectivity if you can complete
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240]   the operation?
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   The nervous system needs to, it doesn't feel discomfort, it creates discomfort, but the
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.200]   nervous system needs a cue to like, okay, this is different, I'm failing.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.280]   And it's the failures that actually trigger the plasticity, it's the discomfort that cues
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.680]   that conditions are different now.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.440]   Otherwise, there's simply no reason to devote energetic resources to rewiring neurons.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.640]   And I feel like we don't learn this when we're kids.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.600]   And I think as kids, we can learn so much without that feeling of agitation.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.760]   We get into these modes of looking for flow.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.220]   And I have respect for the research on flow and the people who are involved, but I'd like
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.460]   to talk about flow a little bit.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.240]   The only thing I really know about flow for sure is that backwards, it spells wolf.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.360]   So what of flow?
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.680]   It's such an attractive idea, right?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.760]   It's like Star Wars.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.400]   It's like you have the force and you're doing things without thinking and awesome.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.680]   But I can't flow myself through a paper and extract the critical data.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.120]   I can't create a podcast in flow, but when it's done, it feels great, especially if you
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.600]   nail the key metrics.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.120]   So what do you think about flow?
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.480]   I'm not trying to beat up on it, I just want to understand how you place it in the framework
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.180]   of learning and deep work, if it belongs there at all.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.920]   It doesn't have a big place in it, in the deep work framework, and this was what the
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.480]   controversy was for a while.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.820]   And I knew Mahaley a little bit.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.820]   We corresponded some.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.820]   And I knew Anders a little bit.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.820]   We corresponded some.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.360]   So I sort of felt like I was-- and both of them actually tragically have died in the
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.820]   last three or four years, I think.
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.320]   Oh, that's very sad.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.820]   Yeah, I think both recently.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.420]   Flow doesn't play a big role in the deep work framework, right?
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.120]   So when I was trying to justify deep work, so why focusing without distraction was important,
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.640]   I was drawing a lot more for Anders' work, right?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   Because why is focusing without distraction important?
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.640]   Well, you have to quiet the neural circuitry so you can isolate the circuit that's actually
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.080]   relevant to the thing that you're doing, right?
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.680]   You're not going to get better at something if you have noisy circuitry.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.280]   And that requires a really intense concentration.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.640]   So it was one of the big advantages of deep work was if you're used to that cognitive
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   state, you're going to learn things faster.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.200]   And I think it was all Anders to understand why.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.220]   So if you're not distracted, I'm really focusing hard on what I'm doing, trying to learn this
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.360]   new thing, you're giving the right mental conditions.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   But it's not a flow state.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.420]   And I always used to say, OK, when your deep work is not flow because of this.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.280]   Like a lot of deep work is you're trying to do something that is beyond your comfort zone,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.400]   and that's going to be difficult.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.240]   That's a state of deliberate practice.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.920]   And there's a famous paper about this where Anders actually explicitly says deliberate
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.240]   practice and flow are very different.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.480]   And I wrote an essay years ago called The Father of Deliberate Practice Disowns Flow.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.240]   And again, people are really flow partisans out there.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   It's interesting.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.040]   I think people just like the idea because it feels good.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.960]   But I mean, flow is the feeling of performance is the way I think about it.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.840]   Like it's really hard to train for certain sports.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   But then when you're actually performing, you're in the game, you can fall in the flow,
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   right?
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.840]   Because then everything is-- and it's really hard to train guitar.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.640]   But like when you're performing in front of a big crowd, you probably-- maybe you fall
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   in the flow.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   I mean, you could, right?
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.000]   But it's the performance state, not the practicing getting better state.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.720]   So to me, flow has very little role in how I think about what I do as a cognitive professional.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.560]   It's just not something that comes up that often.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   I agree that we learn through focused work and that flow does manifest itself during
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.920]   performance, and sometimes so much so that people exhibit virtuosity.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.280]   They're surprising themselves even with what's in there, and that's kind of-- I always think
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.240]   of it as what is unskilled, skilled, mastery, virtuosity.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.320]   Virtuosity seems to incorporate some sort of random elements of maybe even the performer
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.000]   has not done that before and they surprise themselves or something like that.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Who knows?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   These are words for something that isn't easily quantified in the first place.
