[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.920]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.040]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.820]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today is an Ask Me Anything or AMA episode,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.860]   which is part of our premium subscriber content.
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.360]   Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast channel,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.180]   which still comes out once a week, every Monday,
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.460]   and of course is zero cost to consumer.
[00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.180]   The premium channel is also designed
[00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.280]   to support exciting research being done
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.940]   at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.960]   research that's done on humans that should lead
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   to protocols for mental health, physical health,
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000]   and performance in the near future.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.080]   If you'd like to check out
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.500]   the premium channel subscription model,

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.760]   you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.500]   of this episode, and hopefully that will allow you
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.040]   to discern whether or not you would like
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.780]   to become a premium subscriber.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.760]   Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.120]   as thorough as possible, and yet as concise as possible.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   The first question today is about adaptogens.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.020]   Some of you may have heard of adaptogens.
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.940]   I'm guessing many of you have not heard of adaptogens.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.560]   The strict definition of adaptogens is still evolving,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.540]   meaning no one really knows what adaptogens mean
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.560]   and what's included in adaptogens
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.800]   and what's excluded from adaptogens.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.100]   But the most common definition of an adaptogen is a compound
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.880]   that is typically a supplement or a drug,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.280]   although it could be a behavior,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.680]   if you really think about it,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.440]   that helps you adapt to and buffer stress.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   So when you hear about adaptogens,
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.700]   there are three main categories of adaptogens
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.880]   that come to mind.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.000]   The first are things that are contained in food.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.400]   So these would be vitamins or micronutrients
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800]   that one could easily find in food,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.240]   but one would have to consume a fairly restricted number
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.760]   or type of foods in order to obtain those things,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.600]   or consume a lot of those foods
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.160]   in order to get sufficient dosages
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120]   of those adaptogen compounds in order to buffer stress.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.360]   Some good examples of these would be any kind of vitamin,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.600]   either water-soluble or fat-soluble that can adjust
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.400]   or reduce what are so-called reactive oxygen species.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.080]   And then that's what gives rise to this idea
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.520]   that antioxidants are good for us.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.840]   Now, over the last 10 years or so, there's been a shift.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   What shift has occurred?
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.880]   Well, about 10 years ago,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.600]   you often heard about antioxidants, antioxidants,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.620]   antioxidants and vitamins,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.840]   antioxidants in this food, this superfood, et cetera.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.120]   And why were people talking about antioxidants?
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.560]   Well, just to remind you, reactive oxygen species
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.960]   are types of reactions and molecules that occur in cells
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   when cells get stressed and/or age,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.920]   and antioxidants are the compounds
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.080]   that reduce those reactive oxygen species.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.360]   Reactive oxygen species are bad for cells
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.140]   because they tend to hinder the function of mitochondria,
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.000]   which are associated with energy production in those cells.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.440]   So what do we know for sure?
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.800]   We know that as cells get older
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.120]   or as any cell or biological system,
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.400]   organ, tissue, et cetera, gets stressed a lot over time,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.160]   the number of reactive oxygen species
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.800]   increases in those cells and tissues and organs,
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.560]   and antioxidants, which can include certain vitamins
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.640]   but also some micronutrients,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.140]   are effective in reducing those reactive oxygen species.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.680]   Now, what's occurred over the last 10 years
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.640]   is that we know that reactive oxygen species
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.320]   are a major source of depleting cellular function
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.480]   by way of depleting mitochondrial function,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.360]   but they are just one of many mechanisms
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.300]   that can deplete cellular function, mitochondrial function.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.240]   So nowadays, you'll hear about reactive oxygen species
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.920]   and antioxidants, but not as much as you used to.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.980]   Now you hear a lot more about inflammatory responses,
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.280]   and inflammatory cytokines also be an issue.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.900]   And the truth is all of these things are an issue.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.760]   So going back to this question about adaptogens,
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.160]   adaptogens include these three categories,
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.000]   I've told you the first,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.400]   which are the vitamins and micronutrients
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.600]   that are contained in food
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.500]   that can reduce reactive oxygen species
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.880]   and other aspects of cellular stress,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.500]   such as inflammatory cytokines.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.800]   What are some of those things that occur in foods?
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.680]   Well, in order to answer that,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.000]   let's just think about what sorts of foods themselves
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.680]   can act as adaptogens.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.320]   It's commonly held that the dark leafy greens type foods,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.440]   for those of you that eat plants,
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.460]   and I think the majority of people out there do eat plants.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.620]   I know that the carnivore diet and lion diet
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.960]   and some other diets tend to exclude plants.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.880]   We'll address that briefly at some point
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.760]   in today's discussion.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.240]   But dark leafy greens are known to contain
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.440]   a number of compounds in the form of vitamins
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   and micronutrients that are very effective
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.680]   in reducing reactive oxygen species
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.700]   and inflammatory cytokines.
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.480]   So if you're somebody who's interested in adaptogens
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.160]   and adaptogenic processes,
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.560]   reducing stress and buffering stress,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.620]   which of course has its role in buffering daily stress
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.820]   in order to help you sleep better,
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.820]   to improve cellular function for longevity,
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.920]   sports performance, cognitive performance,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.340]   that is all good and it makes sense
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.960]   why people would be interested in adaptogens.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.040]   But remember that the two main adaptogens
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.160]   that you should think to first
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.100]   are going to be behaviors and nutrition.
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.400]   I've started with nutrition on purpose.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.260]   As I mentioned, we'll get to behaviors in a moment.
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.240]   So if you're interested in adaptogens at all,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   I highly recommend that you include
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.520]   at least two to four servings of dark leafy greens
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.960]   and/or cruciferous vegetables per day.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.960]   I think that'd be highly advantageous.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.800]   And just be aware that excessively heating
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.920]   dark leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.680]   can actually destroy the very nutrients and micronutrients
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.580]   that act in an adaptogenic way.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.680]   That does not mean that you need to eat raw broccoli
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.600]   or cauliflower.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.160]   Just the thought of that makes me nauseous.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   It's very hard to digest.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.300]   Some people might like that or can digest it more easily
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.140]   than others.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.280]   So it's perfectly fine to cook your cruciferous vegetables
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.420]   and dark leafy greens,
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.140]   but you don't want to overcook them.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.700]   What's overcooking and what's under cooking?
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.680]   There's no strict cutoff in terms of temperature,
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.100]   but basically what the literature says
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.140]   is that if you heat vegetables to the point
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.740]   where the colored fluid is leaching out of them
[00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.160]   into a broth type, into water,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.820]   whatever fluid surrounds them,
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.560]   well then you would be well off to ingest that fluid as well
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.320]   because it contained in the water
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.860]   or the fluid that's leaching out
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.320]   from the cruciferous vegetables
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.580]   or from the dark leafy greens
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.860]   are going to be a lot of those very adaptogenic molecules
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.620]   that you're interested in the first place.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.140]   Okay, so I probably surprised some people
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.720]   by starting off my answer to the question
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.940]   of what are adaptogens?
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.000]   Are they worth thinking about and pursuing?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.820]   And if so, how can I get them?
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.240]   By talking about food.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.720]   But I think it is important to understand
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.480]   that you can get a lot of adaptogens from food.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.260]   And indeed some of the best adaptogens
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.060]   do come from dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.200]   So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.700]   The other two categories of adaptogens
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.100]   are going to be supplement-based adaptogens
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.900]   and then behavioral adaptogens.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.300]   Again, here adaptogen defined as anything
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.200]   that can buffer stress in a substantial or meaningful way
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.220]   in order to support cellular health, organ health,
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.680]   and overall daily living and functioning,
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.140]   including sleep and performance and mental health.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.380]   So the second category of adaptogen
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.500]   are going to be supplements.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.540]   And here again, I just want to take a step back
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.760]   and make sure that we are clear
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.340]   about our operational definition about what a supplement is.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.220]   We had an episode all about
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.680]   how to design a rational guide to supplementation,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.500]   which included, for example,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.980]   the idea that for some people,
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.020]   the optimal dosage of many supplements is going to be zero.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.360]   And for other people, the dosage will be something else.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.660]   But to really pinpoint the key message from that episode
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.540]   that I'd like to reiterate now,
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.040]   but a key message from that episode
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.740]   that I'd like to reiterate now
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.240]   is that many people think of supplements
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.020]   as just vitamin supplements.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.700]   And for that reason, you'll often hear the argument,
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.020]   oh, well, aren't supplements just expensive urine?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.540]   Couldn't you get all of that from food?
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.600]   Aren't you just urinating out all the water soluble vitamins
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320]   and maybe even storing excess amounts
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.540]   of the fat soluble vitamins in a way that's unhealthy
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.340]   or not cost-effective and so on.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.680]   When we talk about supplements,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.340]   yes, it can include vitamin supplements.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.120]   However, there are many compounds
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   that we would describe as supplements
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.780]   that are not vitamin supplements
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.620]   and that you could not obtain from food
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.380]   or that you could never obtain from food
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.700]   in sufficient enough qualities
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.700]   to have a robust positive biological effect
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.920]   without consuming an enormous number of calories
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.940]   or overriding your gut mechanically.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.780]   For instance, if there were say a herb,
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.500]   and we'll talk about such herbs in a moment,
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.180]   that contained an effective adaptogen,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.340]   but you would never want to eat the plant itself
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.720]   or include that herb in any kind of recipe,
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.380]   well, then chances are this herb,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.820]   which we'll define in a moment, is not a vitamin supplement.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.000]   It is probably not even best thought of as a supplement.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.420]   It's best thought of as a compound
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.600]   that's sold over the counter,
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.320]   much like a prescription drug,
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   although it's not prescription.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.240]   It doesn't require a prescription to get it.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.520]   So there are a lot of things like that
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.600]   that we include under the umbrella of this word supplements.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.800]   And unfortunately, because of that,
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.620]   a lot of people think, oh, you don't need supplements.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.960]   And of course you don't need supplements per se,
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.680]   but many people do derive tremendous benefit from them.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.060]   In the context of adaptogens,
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.780]   there are two or three in particular
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.620]   that can be very beneficial
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.140]   for buffering the stress response,
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.740]   especially over short periods of time
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.600]   of about two to three weeks.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.120]   So when would you use these?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.960]   Well, for instance,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.280]   if you are in a particularly stressful mode of life,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.680]   either because of family or relational or school
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   or work demands or new kid in the house
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.020]   or any number of different things,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.820]   or you've been ill or you're recovering from injury,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.120]   taking an adaptogen in the form of supplement
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.560]   can actually be very useful for buffering this hormone
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.720]   and the general systems it's associated with called cortisol.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.480]   It's very healthy to have high levels of cortisol
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.640]   early in the day, shortly after you wake up,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.480]   and then that ought to taper off
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.860]   toward the afternoon and evening.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.400]   However, if cortisol is chronically elevated
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.220]   throughout the day,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.000]   or if that peak in cortisol is arriving too late in the day,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.280]   that is known to be associated
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.040]   with mental health and physical health issues
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.400]   has been shown by labs at Stanford and elsewhere.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.440]   It's been shown in animal models and in humans.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.840]   Talked many times before, and I'll just remind you again,
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.800]   that one of the best ways to restrict that cortisol peak
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   to the early part of the day
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.340]   is to get morning sunlight in your eyes as soon as you can,
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.640]   once the sun is up, get outside,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.900]   facing the direction of the sun, even on overcast days,
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.720]   don't wear sunglasses, look at it for five to 30 minutes,
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.000]   definitely blink so you don't damage your eyes,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.760]   so on and so forth.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.380]   Why five minutes or 30 minutes?
[00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.440]   Well, five minutes on a clear day should be sufficient,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.460]   longer would be fine.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.480]   Again, blink so that you protect your eyes,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.200]   blink as needed, facing the general direction of the sun.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.920]   On days when you have a lot of overcast
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   or it's really dark, dense cloud cover,
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.920]   well, then you'd want to be outside longer,
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.640]   and if you don't have access to sunlight
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.320]   for whatever reason, then you want to do the same thing
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.680]   with bright artificial lights indoors,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.560]   either so-called sad lamp or otherwise.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.920]   That's a great way to restrict that cortisol peak
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.600]   to early in the day, but even if you're doing that,
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.760]   if you have a stressful life for whatever reason,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.200]   even if you're getting that morning sunlight,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   which I hope you are, you're getting your exercise,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.980]   you're trying to sleep better and more,
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980]   as we all should most of the time,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.120]   well, then you may be somebody
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.120]   who wants to take a adaptogen in the form of a supplement,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.420]   and the three supplements that can be very effective
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.120]   in buffering cortisol are ashwagandha,
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.720]   which I'll talk about first, lion's mane, and chaga.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.520]   Lion's mane and chaga are in the fungi group,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   so they count as mushrooms.
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.940]   They are not psychedelic mushrooms.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.560]   Let's talk about ashwagandha first.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.080]   Ashwagandha is at the top of the list
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.720]   because it is indeed a very potent adaptogen.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.600]   How can I say that?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.600]   Well, there are a number of studies now,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.040]   including several excellent ones in humans,
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.500]   that report that taking two doses of 300 milligrams
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.360]   of ashwagandha per day
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.720]   can very dramatically buffer cortisol.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.320]   So this is something that you would have
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.300]   a near impossible time accessing from food.
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.000]   I can't imagine that unless you're cooking
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.240]   with the very sources of ashwagandha
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.960]   and extracting exact amounts that you'd be able to get this
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.600]   in any other form except a supplement form.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.760]   So here, I'm going to just briefly reference a paper
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.180]   and we can provide a reference link to this.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.600]   That is, this is a paper from 2012
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.740]   that's had a lot of excellent follow-up papers
[00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:48.580]   that support it.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.420]   The title of the paper is
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.680]   "A Perspective Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.360]   Study of Safety and Efficacy of High Concentration
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.480]   of Full-Spectrum Extract of Ashwagandha Root
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.760]   in Reducing Stress and Anxiety in Adults."
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.400]   And it's a really nice study, not a huge subject pool,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.020]   but both men and women, and it's carried out for long enough
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.960]   that they got to see some really interesting results.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.620]   And I think that the most interesting result
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.560]   is that taking 300 milligrams of ashwagandha twice a day
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.300]   led to enormous, I mean, just enormous changes
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.140]   in serum cortisol.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.400]   The statistical significance that they observed
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.900]   in the study was really fantastic,
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.920]   fantastically high statistical significance.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.980]   They saw the effects of ashwagandha on day 15,
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.380]   having initiated the ashwagandha consumption
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.480]   on day one, of course, day 30 and day 45.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.300]   And again, this was dramatic reductions in stress
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.500]   as perceived by people.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.780]   So subjective stress and cortisol levels.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.400]   So ashwagandha is very potent at reducing cortisol.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.520]   How would you recapitulate this
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.860]   if you wanted to use ashwagandha to buffer stress?
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.320]   Well, a couple of key points.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.060]   Mentioned earlier that you want your cortisol peak
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.840]   to come earlier in the day.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.980]   Therefore, you would not want to buffer cortisol
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.820]   early in the day.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.700]   In fact, cortisol peaking early in the day
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.700]   provides an anti-inflammatory, immune-supporting focus
[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.220]   and mood-supporting effect all day long.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.820]   So I would recommend that people take their first dose
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.020]   of ashwagandha of anywhere from 250 to 300 milligrams
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.500]   sometime in the early afternoon.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.560]   And again, in the evening,
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.460]   as opposed to taking a morning dose and an afternoon dose.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.180]   Also, if you're somebody who's exercising
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:35.380]   for sake of trying to induce adaptations like hypertrophy,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.020]   the growth of muscles or strength,
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.600]   or improve your endurance in any way, muscular endurance
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.660]   or more traditional cardiovascular endurance,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.900]   then I recommend that you not take your ashwagandha
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.300]   prior to exercise because part of the adaptation response
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.980]   is triggered by increases in cortisol during exercise.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.320]   Sort of in the same way that some of the best adaptations
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.180]   to exercise are reductions in blood pressure
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.380]   and resting heart rate.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.860]   And those are stimulated by increases in blood pressure
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.980]   and increases in heart rate during exercise.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.800]   That's just how these biological systems work.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.720]   So the takeaway is pretty simple.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.780]   If you're interested in using ashwagandha as an adaptogen,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.760]   I would restrict it to later in the day if you can
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.280]   and not before exercise.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.060]   Divide it into two doses of 250 to 300 milligrams.
[00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.200]   That's what this paper and other papers like it
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.040]   seem to indicate.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.380]   And then a very important final point about ashwagandha,
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.280]   which is that if you're going to take ashwagandha,
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.920]   I recommend not taking it for longer than a month and a half
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.880]   as they did in this study.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.760]   In fact, I would suggest that you only take ashwagandha
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.040]   around periods of kind of moderate to extreme stress.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.080]   What's moderate, what's extreme is going to depend
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.360]   on what you're going through.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.800]   Only you know how much stress
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.280]   and life events you can tolerate.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.400]   So if you've had trouble sleeping and that's unusual for you
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.360]   or you're dealing with a very difficult life circumstances
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   or excessive work demand or a new kid,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.080]   as I mentioned before,
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.360]   well then buffering stress with ashwagandha,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.800]   buffering cortisol in the afternoon and evening
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.100]   can be very beneficial for you.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.060]   But then I would say after about 30 days maximum,
[00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.900]   I would take at least two to four weeks off.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.620]   Two weeks is probably enough, but four weeks off
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.520]   because you don't want to chronically buffer cortisol.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.940]   It's just not a good idea.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.780]   But that said,
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.260]   I think ashwagandha is a very powerful adaptogen.
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.180]   I would place at the top of the list
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.940]   of supplement-based adaptogens.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.180]   But keep in mind that even if you're taking
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.400]   a supplement-based adaptogen,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.440]   that's no reason to abandon the nutrition
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.860]   and behavioral type adaptogenic effects
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.800]   that you can create through eating dark leafy greens,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.740]   cruciferous vegetables.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.420]   Then we'll talk about the behaviors in a moment.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.940]   The other two supplement-based adaptogens, as I mentioned,
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.300]   are lion's mane mushroom and chaga.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.900]   And I get asked a lot about lion's mane and chaga
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.900]   for sake of their purported roles in acting as nootropics,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.520]   as quote unquote, smart drugs.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.260]   There are fewer data on the beneficial roles
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.760]   of lion's mane and chaga for sake of nootropic effects.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.280]   We'll do an entire episode on nootropics at some point,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.740]   but there have been a few studies showing
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.560]   that lion's mane and supplementation
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.580]   and chaga supplementation can improve memory
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.400]   and maybe even divergent thinking associated with creativity
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.240]   and things of that sort.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.880]   Again, these are not psychedelic mushrooms.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.600]   That said, there are good data showing
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   that 1,000 milligrams,
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.000]   that is one gram of lion's mane per day,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.240]   and/or, okay, these,
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.480]   we'll talk about the and/or portion in a moment,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   and/or chaga mushroom at 500 to 1500 milligrams per day
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.360]   can act as adaptogens in, again, reducing cortisol,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.240]   but also and mainly reducing
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.200]   some of the anti-inflammatory cytokines
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.560]   that are known to circulate in high abundance
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.360]   when you're under a lot of psychological
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.760]   and/or physical stress,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.360]   things like interleukin-6 and some related molecules.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.920]   So here's what I would recommend.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.680]   If you are interested in exploring adaptogens,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.680]   I'm a big fan, as some of you probably know,
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.980]   if you heard that episode
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.640]   on "Rational Guide to Supplementation,"
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.440]   I'm a big fan of mainly focusing on taking supplements
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.580]   in single ingredient formulations
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.080]   so that you can figure out what dosages are best for you
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.960]   and so that you can toggle in and out
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   those adaptogens as needed.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.720]   So I, of course, am a fan of taking certain blends
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.800]   and mixes, the one that we talk about a lot on this podcast,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.420]   and I've been a sponsor from the beginning,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.120]   I've taken for a decade now,
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.680]   long before I ever had a podcast,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.080]   is Athletic Greens, which some of you might note
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.600]   does contain some ashwagandha,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.140]   although the levels of ashwagandha
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.440]   that are contained in Athletic Greens are low enough
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.600]   that I don't see any issue
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.580]   with taking Athletic Greens consistently,
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.280]   day to day, every day,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.680]   because you're not getting anywhere near
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.580]   that 600 milligram dosage.
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.200]   But the idea is that if you are going to take any adaptogen,
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.500]   forsake a buffering stress over the short term,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.120]   say for a week or two weeks or a month,
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.280]   and then taking that recommended time off,
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.320]   I would start with ashwagandha,
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.600]   and then if you feel you need something else
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.080]   to buffer stress, keeping in mind, of course,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.000]   that you're doing the behavioral and the nutritional things
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.560]   to buffer stress as well, you can never abandon those, right?
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.080]   Well, then I would suggest adding 1,000 milligrams
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.820]   or 1,000 milligrams of chaga per day
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.920]   and seeing how that further benefits your system
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.020]   in terms of buffering stress.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.320]   How would you measure if your stress is being reduced?
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.420]   Well, you're going to be sleeping better at night,
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.080]   you're going to feel subjectively better,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.400]   lower levels of anxiety,
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.320]   all the things that are measured in the types of studies
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.000]   I described before.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.540]   Now, of course, there's nothing preventing you
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.760]   from taking 600 milligrams of ashwagandha,
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.800]   a gram of lion's mane and a gram of chaga.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.400]   I know some people like to just kind of go full tilt
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.480]   into everything, but I am a big believer
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.680]   in really trying to isolate which supplements
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.880]   and molecules work best for you and which ones don't.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.280]   Do you need to cycle on and off lion's mane and chaga?
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.520]   I'm not aware of any data showing that you do.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.840]   If, however, you're taking them every day,
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.560]   I recommend that you cycle off them
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.080]   after a period of 30 days or so.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.640]   And I want to be very clear about this,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:02.840]   just because I said cycle off
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.200]   after a period of 30 days or so
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.280]   does not mean that you can't take them
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.840]   for a shorter period of time.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.640]   So for instance, if you know that you're coming up
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.820]   on a big week of stress,
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.760]   well then you could take ashwagandha and/or lion's mane
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.920]   and/or chaga for that week or just that week
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.600]   or heading into that week or in the following week
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.440]   and then stop.
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.320]   There's no reason why you couldn't take them
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.280]   even just for one day,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.200]   although the effects tend to be a bit cumulative,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.860]   at least when we're talking about buffering anxiety.
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.000]   In terms of buffering cortisol,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.200]   that's a very potent effect that as far as we know
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.740]   is going to take place on day one.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.140]   Again, keep that cortisol buffering effect
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.200]   away from exercise.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   At least don't take it before exercise
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.440]   and try and buffer your cortisol
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.760]   in the afternoon and evening.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.000]   And this is assuming that you're working
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.320]   a conventional shift and you're not up all night
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.120]   and sleeping all day for sake of shift work.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.980]   Okay, so hopefully that clarifies things
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.380]   about what adaptogens are.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.800]   In fact, I never actually read the specific question,
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.180]   but I think I've touched on a number of issues
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.680]   that relate to the specific question.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.100]   And then I'll answer the last portion
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.240]   of the answer to this question in a moment
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.820]   as it relates to behavioral tools
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.500]   that can act as adaptogens.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.160]   The question itself was there's a lot of mixed information
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.220]   out there about adaptogens like ashwagandha.
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.600]   I think that relates to what I said earlier,
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.760]   which is that the definition of an adaptogen
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.660]   has not really been cemented in various communities.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.200]   It's different in different communities
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.740]   and it's generally used as a matter of convenience
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.800]   rather than really strictly defining what it is.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.040]   And hopefully we've defined it accurately
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:38.160]   and broadly enough today as something that buffers stress.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.520]   The second part of the question was
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   what does the scientific evidence say about adaptogens
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.100]   and their ability to mediate body stress response?
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.760]   They say quite a lot and they say that the stress response
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.280]   can be buffered substantially by certain adaptogens,
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.680]   mainly dark leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.860]   ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga,
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.440]   and of course all the behavioral things
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.420]   that are critical to what we'll list off in a moment.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.960]   And then the third portion of the question is
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.620]   is there any solid evidence that has an effect
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.200]   on neurotransmitters or the HPA,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.460]   which is part of the stress modulation axis?
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.540]   The best evidence is that adaptogens
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.300]   can reduce cortisol itself.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.820]   There is very little evidence that adaptogens
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.420]   can directly modulate neurotransmitters
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.680]   or neuromodulators like dopamine, serotonin, et cetera.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.500]   But by adjusting the timing and levels of cortisol,
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.580]   especially in the afternoon and evening,
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.240]   that is going to have indirect effects
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.100]   on levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, et cetera,
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.620]   and serotonin, but not direct effects.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.880]   So the general contour that makes
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.780]   for an ideal diurnal schedule, you heard of nocturnal?
[00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.260]   Well, the opposite is diurnal,
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.900]   being awake during the daytime and asleep at night.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.720]   The ideal kind of landscape of neurotransmitters
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.880]   is higher levels of dopamine, norepinephrine,
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.500]   and epinephrine in the early part of the day,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.700]   and cortisol, so-called catecholamines,
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.900]   dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine,
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.900]   and high levels of cortisol early in the day
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.780]   as directed by sunlight, exercise, caffeine,
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.740]   hydration, movement, all that stuff,
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.280]   being awake and busy and outside
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.980]   or indoors with bright lights
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.860]   and moving about in the early part of the day
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.860]   and into the early afternoon.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.360]   That's the best possible way that we are aware of
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.180]   to try and get those catecholamines released
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.980]   at the highest levels in the early part of the day.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.040]   And then the ideal contour of a 24-hour cycle
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.400]   will be in the later half of the day,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.960]   the evening and nighttime,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.800]   you have higher levels of things like serotonin,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.860]   the GABAergic system,
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.720]   all the things that are somewhat sedative
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.380]   in preparing you for sleep,
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.660]   and lower levels of the catecholamines and cortisol,
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.840]   as I described before.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.460]   So to directly answer the question,
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.020]   is there any evidence that adaptogens
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.240]   can alter your neurotransmitters?
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.420]   Yes, but only indirectly.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.520]   And yet that indirect control over neurotransmitters
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.720]   is substantial and is important.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.200]   And if you do what I described,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.440]   such as getting morning sunlight,
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.880]   and ideally you'd get a little bit
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.620]   of deliberate cold water exposure, by the way,
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.620]   to boost adrenaline and norepinephrine and dopamine,
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.480]   those catecholamines, early in the day.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   So quick one-minute cold shower even,
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.200]   or three-minute cold shower,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.220]   if you have access to an ice bath early in the day,
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.740]   plus some sunlight, doesn't matter which one you do first,
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.680]   doing that early in the day
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   is really going to create that peak
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.120]   of cortisol, dopamine, epinephrine early in the day.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.000]   I can't emphasize how beneficial all of that can be.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.620]   And exercise, if you can, early in the day.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.320]   Some people can't exercise till later in the day.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.420]   I'd rather see people exercise later in the day
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.640]   than not at all, provided it does not disrupt
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.560]   their nighttime sleep, which of course,
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.160]   sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.280]   So yes, there's modulation of neurotransmitters,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.560]   but most of those are downstream of the effects on cortisol
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.680]   that we've been talking about.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.280]   So we've defined nutritional adaptogens,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.920]   supplement-based adaptogens,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.520]   although I don't really like the word supplements anymore,
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.280]   unless we're talking about vitamin supplements
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.960]   for reasons we talked about earlier.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.020]   And then there's the third category of adaptogens,
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.120]   which are the behavioral tools that you can use
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   to buffer stress, which qualifies those as an adaptogen.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.600]   And I think it's really important
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.080]   that we always keep in mind that yes, there are supplements.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.520]   Yes, there are prescription drugs out there.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.360]   In fact, there are prescription drugs
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.400]   that you can get from a doctor
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.040]   that will potently zero out your cortisol.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.700]   But most doctors are very reluctant
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.540]   to prescribe those drugs because cortisol provides
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.040]   a very important and functional role early in the day.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.020]   Behaviors are very effective at reducing cortisol.
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.620]   What are the most effective behaviors to reduce cortisol?
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.840]   Well, we talked about one,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.460]   to restrict cortisol the early part of the day,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.240]   which is viewing morning sunlight,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.960]   but how would you buffer cortisol in the late afternoon?
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.660]   It's going to be all the things associated
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.980]   with reducing stress.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.340]   For instance, 10 minutes, or even my laboratory
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.580]   and other laboratories have shown
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.740]   it's even five minutes a day of just what would be called
[00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.520]   mindfulness meditation, very simple.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.820]   You don't need to over-complicate this.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.100]   You could use a great app like the Waking Up app
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.800]   or another app of that sort,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.960]   or you can simply sit down, eyes closed,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.800]   breathe through your nose
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.120]   and just concentrate on your breathing
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.840]   every time your mind drifts to something else,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.320]   bring it back to your breathing.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.520]   That's shown to reduce stress.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.320]   You could do a five minute deliberate breath work practice.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.280]   My laboratory has published some work related to that.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.600]   The breath work practice could be any number of things.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.680]   The two that I recommend the most would be double inhale,
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   followed by a full exhale,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.800]   and then repeat for a period of five minutes,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.540]   known to substantially reduce anxiety, stress,
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.220]   and the various physiological systems
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.560]   associated with arousal.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.160]   You could also use box breathing.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.860]   Inhale, hold, exhale, hold for equal durations
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.240]   for a period of five minutes
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.040]   will substantially reduce stress.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.440]   I'm a big fan, as many of you know, of yoga nidra,
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.800]   which involves no movement.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.840]   It involves just lying there, listening to a script,
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.580]   lots of yoga nidra scripts available online.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.780]   If you're not interested in the intentions
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.220]   and other things, including yoga nidra,
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.940]   you can buffer stress using an adaptogen
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.060]   like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.540]   If you're interested in trying these sorts of things,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.460]   there's a NSDR protocol that's 10 minutes long.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.740]   Just put my name, Huberman, and NSDR
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.540]   into the search browser on YouTube,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.720]   and Virtusan has provided an NSDR
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.080]   that's completely zero cost
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.100]   and works very well for reducing stress.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.080]   It will also help teach your system
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   and teach you how to learn to fall asleep better at night.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.520]   So any of those practices,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.440]   five to 10 minute breathing practice or meditation
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.880]   or a NSDR or yoga nidra.
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.800]   I mean, if you can do longer,
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.280]   20 or 30 minutes in the afternoon,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   that's known to buffer cortisol substantially as well.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.480]   Anytime you're encountering stress in real time,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.960]   I highly recommend a tool over and over
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.940]   because it's so effective.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.440]   The fastest way we know to buffer stress and calm down
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.520]   is the so-called physiological sigh.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.400]   Big inhale through the nose until your lungs are empty,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.320]   but then sneak in a little bit more air by a second inhale,
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.380]   maximally inflate the lungs,
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.600]   then a long exhale until your lungs are empty.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.200]   One to three of those will reduce your stress substantially.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.540]   Over time, that should reduce, that is,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:50.040]   buffer your cortisol acting as an adaptogen.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.880]   There are a lot of things.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.360]   You could take a hot bath, you could take a hot shower,
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   you can listen to some pleasant music.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.940]   Anything that reduces your stress
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.320]   technically is an adaptogen.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.080]   So I hope I've thoroughly answered your question.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.800]   By yours, I mean, of course,
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.040]   this answer is going out to all of you.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   This is a question that was asked by Justine Bevilacqua.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.040]   I hope I pronounced that correctly, Justine.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.200]   And thank you for that question.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.440]   I think there are a lot of people interested in adaptogens.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.560]   So now you know you can use nutrition,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.680]   such as cruciferous vegetables, dark leafy greens.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.000]   And I should also mention,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.360]   if you're not ingesting enough calories each day,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.900]   well, then you are going to be in a mild mode of stress.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.200]   That's not to say that some people
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.680]   shouldn't take in fewer calories than they burn
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.120]   in order to lose weight.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.860]   Some people really need to do that for their health
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.280]   or for whatever other reason.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:34.800]   But if you restrict calories too much,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.520]   you are going to increase cortisol output.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.840]   So keep that in mind.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.300]   So ingest sufficient calories for you and for your goals.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.080]   Aim to get dark leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.840]   Don't overcook them.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.400]   If you want to explore supplements,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.480]   the best supplements that act as adaptogens
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.800]   are going to be ashwagandha, lion's mane, and chaga.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.520]   One or two or three of those,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.200]   although if you're going to pick one,
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   I'd recommend ashwagandha at 600 milligrams per day,
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.120]   taken in the later half of the day.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.080]   And then there are the behavioral tools
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   that we just talked about now,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.580]   which are anything that reduces stress can reduce cortisol.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.460]   And in doing so are technically adaptogens.
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.800]   If you want to know more behavioral tools and other tools
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.160]   for adjusting stress and learn more about adaptogens,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.880]   we did a whole episode called Mastering Stress.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.960]   So you can look to that.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.380]   That episode also pretty clearly defines, I like to think,
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.740]   what short-term, medium-term, and long-term stress
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:28.580]   really are.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.880]   Keep in mind, stress is part of life.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.860]   Learning how to work with it, how to dance with it,
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.500]   how to buffer it is terrific,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.260]   but zeroing out cortisol is not the goal.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.940]   The goal is to learn to modulate and control your cortisol.
[00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.460]   And that's really what adaptogens are all about.
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.020]   Thank you for joining for the beginning
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.960]   of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.340]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:50.940]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.220]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.420]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.020]   Standard Channel and premium tools
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.440]   not released anywhere else,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.580]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.780]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.980]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.860]   it's really twofold.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.780]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.260]   for the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.300]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.980]   every Monday in full length.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.380]   We are not going to change the format
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.980]   or anything about the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.420]   and to fund research.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.460]   In particular, research done on human beings,
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.500]   so not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.300]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.500]   that we are most interested in.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.140]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.180]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.080]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.500]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.180]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.500]   and other media channels.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.080]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.260]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.460]   and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.200]   that provides those kinds of answers in the first place.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.540]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.500]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.860]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.780]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.380]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.340]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.420]   to further support research for science
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.180]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.700]   physical health, and performance.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.540]   If you'd like to sign up
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.300]   for the Huberman Lab Premium Channel,
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.380]   again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.140]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.480]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.380]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.980]   And you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.340]   that other people ask as well.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.280]   There will also be some premium content,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.100]   such as transcripts of the AMAs
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.000]   and various transcripts and protocols
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.220]   of Huberman Lab Podcast episodes not found elsewhere.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.540]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.900]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.300]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.980]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.860]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.720]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.880]   (upbeat music)
