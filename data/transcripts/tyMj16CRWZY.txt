[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.720]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles, in chapter 4.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.160]   And I feel I must read to you the entire section we are dealing with, namely from verse 13
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.440]   to verse 22.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.040]   I want particularly tonight to call your attention to two phrases.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.560]   One is found in verse 14.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   They could say nothing against it.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.040]   And the same really is said in verse 21.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   They let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:46.000]   And the other phrase is the phrase put by the Apostle Peter in the words, "Judge ye."
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.520]   They could say nothing against it.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.720]   "Judge ye."
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.160]   Now we are looking at this paragraph here for the fourth time, and we are looking at
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.400]   it still and have been looking at it for one great reason, and that is that it is an account
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.800]   of the early church and of something which happened in the early church.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.840]   It's the account, of course, of the first persecution that was suffered by the early
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.200]   infant Christian church.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.280]   But our real reason for looking at it is this, that here we are told exactly what the Christian
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.480]   message is, what the Christian church is, and what the business and function of the
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320]   Christian church is.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.120]   I do this, I say once more, because of the terrible confusion over this very matter.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.240]   What is the business of the Christian church?
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.200]   Now I've said that the last three Sunday nights, haven't I?
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.560]   And if it was necessary to say that in past weeks, how much more so is it necessary to
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.560]   say tonight?
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.480]   That's all I'm going to say about that, no more.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.440]   However, this is, I say, the reason why I'm calling attention to this whole matter.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.940]   There is not only confusion in the world outside as to what Christianity is, there is obviously
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.440]   confusion inside the church with regard to what it is.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.840]   And my argument is this, that if we're really honest, and we really do want to know what
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.760]   Christianity is, what this message is, well then, we are in honor bound to come back to
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   this record.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.440]   It's no use taking up a book written by some modern man in which he tells you what
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.480]   he thinks it ought to be.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.440]   This after all is something that has been going for nearly two thousand years.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.240]   And if you want to know what it is, you've got to go back to its origin, to its beginning.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   And here is the only authentic account that we have.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.760]   Here it is, as evidenced by the speech, conduct, and behavior of these two leading apostles
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   and representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, Peter and John.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.440]   But why should we be concerned about this at all?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.600]   Somebody may say, "Christianity is an anachronism.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.760]   It's got nothing to say to this modern world."
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.040]   Our reply to that is this, that it is the only thing that holds out any hope at all
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.640]   for the modern world.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.080]   Isn't it obvious that everything else is failing?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.120]   All the schemes and the devices of men, all the propositions of your philosophers, where
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.440]   are they and what are they doing for us?
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.440]   No, no.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.560]   This remains, as it has always been, the only hope for this world.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.160]   And that is why we are calling your attention to it.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160]   Now then, what have we found?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   Well, let me summarize it.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.680]   We've found something like this.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.600]   We've looked at the general nature and character of this thing.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.960]   It cuts right across all the world's ideas.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.560]   The world thinks that you arrive at saving truth by using your mind.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.840]   Well we are told here that that's obviously not the way.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.320]   The leaders are unlearned and ignorant men.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.760]   The preachers of the gospel are not Greek philosophers.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.480]   They are Palestinian fishermen.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.120]   That doesn't put any premium on ignorance.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.680]   That doesn't put any premium on lack of ability.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.480]   But it does show this, that it is not primarily and essentially something in men.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.160]   It is what God makes of men.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.920]   And he can do it as well with unlearned and ignorant men as he can with the great and
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   the learned.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.720]   There was that first general view we took of the whole subject.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.520]   Then we looked at the essential message.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.400]   It's all in the name of Christ, by the authority of Christ, and it's about him.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.240]   The things that they have seen and heard, not philosophy but facts, seen and heard,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.800]   these mighty acts and events which are recorded in the pages of the gospel.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.080]   And then we went on last Sunday night to look at the effect that this message has on those
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.520]   who believe it.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.600]   And we saw that it leads them into a state and condition in which they say we cannot
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.960]   but speak of the things which we have seen and heard.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.320]   It changes them and it fills them with a sense of joy, a desire to tell everybody about it,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.920]   and a desire that everybody else may experience it.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.800]   But now I want to take another and a last view of this paragraph this evening, and it's
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.360]   a very vital one.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.640]   I've been putting it like this, that what's so wonderful about this paragraph is that
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:45.440]   it enables us to look at the same truth from different standpoints, different angles, different
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.280]   perspectives, if you like, and they're all very valuable.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   And the one we're going to look at tonight is equally valuable, because what we are told
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.000]   here, the thing I'm emphasizing this evening is this, that this message, this truth, this
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.560]   thing committed by the Lord to the Christian Church, this deposit, this message, this thing
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.040]   that the Christian Church is talking about and preaching, this is something we are reminded
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.400]   here that always calls for a decision.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   I go beyond that.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.880]   It is something that always produces a decision.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.880]   Isn't that obvious in this paragraph?
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.480]   Have you noticed the division in people here?
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.040]   Peter and John, the apostles, the Christians, that's one side.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.560]   The other side, these rulers, the Sanhedrin, this collection of priests and captains of
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.160]   the temple and the Sadducees and Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.960]   and the kindred of the high priest, they're on the other side.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.800]   And what has divided them is this message.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.120]   But you notice there was another division also, comparable to this.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.560]   On the one hand, we have these authorities, the members of the Sanhedrin, but this is
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.760]   what I read in verse 21, "When they had further threatened them, they let them go,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.620]   For all men glorified God for that which was done."
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.320]   The common people glorified God for that which was done, the Sanhedrin didn't.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.840]   They were annoyed about it, and they're trying to put a stop to it.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.560]   So here you see, this is obvious, isn't it, about this message.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.040]   It always calls for a decision, and it always gets one.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.440]   It divides mankind into two groups, those who are for it, those who are against it.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.480]   And we're, every one of us, in that kind of position.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.080]   You see, it's put here very dramatically, these men themselves, they betray themselves,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   beholding the men which was healed standing with them.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720]   They could say nothing against it, and they've got to admit that.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.080]   What shall we do to these men?
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.360]   They're the problem.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.960]   What shall we do to these men?
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.640]   Now I say that this message always produces that reaction.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   You've got to do something about it.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.400]   What shall we do with these men?
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.840]   "For indeed that a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.120]   dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it."
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.840]   Very well, we've got to do something about it.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   They saw that.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.280]   They were driven to do something about it.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.960]   And the Apostle Peter, of course, tells them the same thing.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   Here they are, issuing their edict, prohibiting any further preaching or teaching in the name
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   of Jesus.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.600]   And Peter says, "All right, whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   you more than unto God."
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.880]   "Judge ye!"
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.760]   He throws it back to them.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.400]   You've got to judge, you've got to decide.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.040]   So what they'd already realized themselves, the Apostle presses upon their minds and their
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.440]   hearts and upon their consciences.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.720]   And now I'm just trying to show you this evening that this is something that is always
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.000]   inevitable with regard to this message.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.320]   You read the Gospels and you'll find that in the days of our Lord himself here on earth
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.720]   it always had this effect.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   He put it as a question, "What think ye of the Christ?"
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   That's it.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.960]   But then you see, they saw it again themselves.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.520]   What shall we do with this Jesus?
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.760]   What shall we do with him?
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760]   You've got to do something with him.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   He's there.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   You can't evade him.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.280]   And he demands and calls for this decision.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.960]   And I'm directing attention to this because, of course, it is still the same.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:56.760]   Here he stands still, here is the message concerning him, still confronting us.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.560]   And what I'm suggesting at this moment is this, that unless this message has forced
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.160]   us to a decision, it just means this, that we've never really heard it.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.880]   We've never heard it.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   You can be within earshot of it without hearing it.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.520]   But when this message truly comes, it always insists upon a decision.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.200]   And as I say, it always produces it.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.720]   To do nothing about it is a decision.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.800]   It means you reject it.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.560]   We're all either for or else we're automatically against.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   There's no middle position.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.760]   There is no mean between two opposites, as Aristotle put it.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.480]   You're either for or you're definitely against.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.360]   Passive resistance is resistance.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.960]   To do nothing is a form of resistance and sometimes the most effective of all.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.840]   And therefore I say we are all in one or the other of these two positions.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.520]   And so, my dear friends, I'm simply here tonight to put this great question to you.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.480]   What have you done with these men?
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.080]   You're in the same position exactly as the Sanhedrin.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.560]   I stand here and I present this message to you.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:11.720]   In my unworthy and small, infinitesimally small way by compass to these apostles, I'm
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.000]   nevertheless holding the same message before you.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.600]   And the question therefore comes to you.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   What shall you do and what are you doing?
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.720]   What have you done with these men, with this message?
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   What's your judgment?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.680]   You've arrived at some sort of judgment.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.800]   And the question I'm asking is, which is it?
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.960]   Now here is the great tragedy in the world.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   That there are so many people still who come to the same decision as these rulers.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.440]   They reject it.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.520]   They have come to a judgment that unfortunately is true of the vast majority of our fellow
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.720]   countrymen in this country at the present time.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Nothing in it, they say.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.840]   Nonsense, played out, rubbish, sob stuff, and all the rest of it.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   Or perhaps by now many of them not even saying anything at all about it.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.320]   Well, there it is.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.240]   They've rejected it.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   And our business is to discover why is it that men and women reject this gospel?
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.720]   What's the cause of unbelief?
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:26.040]   What explains this extraordinary rejection of this amazing message?
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.440]   That's what I'm concerned about.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.000]   There is nothing under heaven more important tonight, my friend, than the decision you
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.480]   come to about this message.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.840]   As I'm going to show you, this is not only something that will affect you while you're
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.520]   in this world, it'll affect you in the next.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.040]   And you can't say that about anything else.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.960]   I'm not here to say a word against political decisions.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   They're necessary.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   They must have government.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.040]   But, you know, your political decisions only last for this life.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.400]   They won't be of the slightest interest or value when you leave this world.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.720]   So it is with everything else.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.320]   What's your opinion about a certain painting?
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   What's your opinion about a certain bit of music?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.040]   All right, full of interest.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   We can do all that.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   Let's indulge it.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.120]   It's all excellent.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.120]   But what I'm saying is this.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.880]   It's only of interest and of value while you're in this world.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.840]   But here is something that will be of concern to you forever and forever and forever.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.920]   Nothing is more important, therefore, than that we should be right in our decision about
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   this matter.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.760]   There is no greater tragedy, I say, than to reject this message.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.960]   What makes men do it?
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.240]   Am I speaking to someone?
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.040]   I know I must be to many who have rejected this hitherto.
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.600]   Have you realized what you're doing, my friend?
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.520]   It is because of my concern for your soul and your eternal destiny that I'm addressing
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.080]   you with this evening and pleading with you.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.360]   And what I'm going to do is this.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:59.600]   I'm going to show you what unbelief is in terms of the members of the Sanhedrin here
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.280]   at Jerusalem.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   We can look on at them.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.440]   Why am I doing it like this?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.160]   Well, I'll tell you why I'm doing it like this.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:15.240]   I'm doing it like this because I know myself and I know human nature.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.880]   I know that we, all of us, when we are involved ourselves in something, tend to be prejudiced.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.000]   We're always on the defensive.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.640]   But when we look on something objectively, well, then we are more dispassionate and we
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.040]   give a better judgment.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.340]   In other words, I'm doing tonight exactly what Nathan the prophet did with King David.
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.520]   You remember the story.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:42.160]   David had committed adultery and then murder.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.480]   And Nathan the prophet was sent by God to him.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.400]   And what Nathan did, of course, was not immediately and directly to tackle David as it were and
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   what he'd done.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.840]   Nathan put a tale to him, put a problem to him, uttered a parable to him.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.800]   He said, "Now look here, something very bad has happened and I want to put it to you our
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.320]   judgment as the king."
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.400]   And in a parabolic form, he described to David the very thing David himself had done.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:12.320]   Not only it was in terms of sheep, and David heard the case and was filled with a sense
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   of righteous indignation.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.280]   This was a terrible thing for the men to have done and he must receive the punishment that
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.660]   he deserved.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.960]   And after he'd committed himself to an objective judgment, Nathan looked him in the eye and
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.080]   said, "Thou art the man."
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.080]   And David saw it.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.880]   And we're all like David.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.760]   We defend ourselves and our position.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:44.360]   But when we look on at the thing, the very same thing, we see it in others and we think
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   we can give a dispassionate judgment and we do.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.200]   And in doing so, we condemn ourselves.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:56.960]   Oh, may God grant that someone this evening listening to this exposition of the position
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:03.160]   and the tragedy of the members of the Sanhedrin so long ago may see himself or herself in
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:11.040]   the like position and seeing it may leave it forever and fall a willing captive to the
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.800]   pleadings of the Son of God.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   Very well then, let's look at it.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.360]   It's all here put before us in a very clear and in a very precise manner.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.080]   I've tried to reduce it to a number of principles so that you can remember it more conveniently.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.600]   The first thing that must engage our attention, obviously, is the spirit of these people,
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.960]   the spirit that animated them.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.160]   You notice you can't read the account without seeing it.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.200]   It's shouting at you.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:46.440]   The prejudice, the bias against.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.000]   Have you noticed the way in which these men are fighting for their position?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.880]   They've got no reason for that.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.160]   They even have to admit that, but still they're doing it.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.160]   Well, what's that?
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.280]   Well, that's nothing but sheer prejudice.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.720]   And here they are frantically trying to find reasons against, but can't find them, but
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   still they're against.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.200]   Now, you see, this is purely a matter of spirit.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.400]   Or did you notice it when I read to you out of that 23rd chapter of the Gospel according
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.400]   to St. Luke?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.760]   Didn't you feel it?
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:24.040]   As you read about that crowd in Pilate, the Roman governor was doing his best to disabuse
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.600]   their minds and to get them to see sense and to have an element of justice in their attitude.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.280]   But no, the more he pleaded with them and put the case to them, the more they shouted
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.120]   away with him, away with him, crucify him.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:44.120]   The violent bias and prejudice with no reason at all, as I'm going to show you.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:50.640]   But you see, this is entirely a matter of one's spirit.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.400]   These members of the Sanhedrin are determined to stop this at all costs and without any
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.920]   reason at all, blinded by a prejudice, by an antagonism.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.800]   And this is something which, of course, is ever a characteristic of unbelief.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.400]   I've already given you the most perfect illustration of it.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:21.800]   How anyone can read those last chapters of the four Gospels with their accounts of the
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:28.000]   treatment meted out to our Lord and not see at once that unbelief is a pure matter of
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.640]   prejudice and of bias, passes my comprehension.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.680]   There it is, the utter unreason of it all.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   And this bitterness, vehemence, that's the word that's used, they vehemently cried out,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.760]   the vehemence of it all, even as you see it here.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.400]   And of course it goes beyond that always.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.820]   It doesn't stop merely at not accepting the message, it persecutes it and it tries to
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   stop it.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.400]   That's what these men do.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:07.000]   They're just determined to stop it and they've got the power to do so and they exercise it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.440]   Now, you can read the story of the Christian Church throughout the running centuries and
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.920]   you'll find that this thing has been repeated and repeated and repeated.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.140]   Indeed it is very largely one whole side of the history of the Christian Church, the story
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.960]   of persecutions.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:33.280]   How princes and powers and potentates have persecuted God's simple faithful people
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.000]   with the same blind prejudice.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.440]   And they've used their power, they've used force, they've used their authority,
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.880]   they've done everything they can to destroy such people, to exterminate them and to silence
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   them completely.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.800]   All the result of this blind bias and prejudice.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.160]   But somebody is probably saying to himself or herself, "That's all right, that's the
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.960]   past, but there's nothing like that now, isn't there?"
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.360]   I suggest to you that there is a great deal of this at the present time.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.960]   And a great deal of this not merely amongst the common people as it were who are outside
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.960]   the church.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.840]   There is a great deal of this at the present time in some of the highest academic circles.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:28.040]   I was reading a few months back an article by an American scientist.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:33.000]   And he mentioned certain names and said that he could give others.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.680]   And this is what he was saying.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.920]   He was a teacher of science and he said he knew numbers of professors and lecturers in
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:47.320]   various colleges who held the view that he personally held with regard to the question
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   of evolution.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:53.640]   In other words, they didn't believe in it, but they dare not say so.
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   Why not?
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.280]   Well, if they did say so, they'd never get promotion.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.480]   They'd be up against the vested interest.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.160]   They'd be up against the bias.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.720]   Didn't matter how brilliant their academic qualifications, didn't matter how excellent
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.480]   their work was or the results they got through their students, if it became known that they
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:21.520]   didn't subscribe to this shibboleth, they would have to suffer for it.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:28.680]   And it took him any sort of exceptional courage to be prepared even to ask questions or to
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:34.800]   put any query to this controlling, prevailing theory.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.960]   Now you see, and I have known many such myself, there are many true Christian people today
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.400]   who are being persecuted in this form and manner.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.720]   I have known people who have been denied office in political circles because they were Christian.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.640]   I knew one man very well indeed who was becoming a leader in political circles.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.280]   The moment that man became a Christian, he was a marked man.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:07.680]   And the powers that be politically in that area kept him in the smallest and the least
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:14.320]   important school belonging to the entire authority for no reason at all but that he had become
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   a Christian.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.800]   And I could multiply my examples and illustrations.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.400]   This is still the spirit, the bias, the prejudice, the assertion of authority, the use of power,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.240]   this bitterness against the thing and this determination to hold it down, come what may,
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.760]   and in spite of everything.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.840]   That's the truth about unbelief, my friend, in its spirit.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:45.320]   Of course, it represents to itself to us as openness.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:51.680]   It talks about free thought, the free thinker.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.520]   The man who rejects the gospel is the free thinker.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:59.120]   It is we who are Christians, we are told we are prejudiced and biased, we are just being
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:06.280]   held in captivity by some old tradition that we've inherited, but they've got free thought,
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:15.680]   open, uninfluenced, detached, indispassionate scientific outlook and attitude.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.560]   I'm sorry to have to put it like this, but there's only one thing to say to that kind
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   of talk.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:24.280]   It's just a simple lie.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:30.120]   There is as much bitterness and prejudice and bias in scientific circles as there is
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.200]   in any other circle.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:40.600]   It is based primarily upon this condition of spirit, and it's as true of the highest
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:46.440]   circles as it is of the lowest circles, as true of the intellectuals as it is of those
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   who are non-intellectual.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.120]   Very well, let's move from that.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.680]   Let me come to something more important even.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.720]   It's utter unreasonableness.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.840]   I want to establish this, because you see, people who are not Christians today are ever
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.000]   claiming that they're in that position because of their use of reason.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.160]   And we, the Christians, we are just the people who've swallowed the sob stuff.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.800]   We are just the unintelligent sentimentalists.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.560]   We are just the singers of the hymns and the choruses, the people who refuse to face the
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   facts of life.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.440]   But the man who reasons and thinks, he cannot possibly believe it.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:27.280]   I want to show you that there is nothing in the world tonight more unreasonable than the
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.960]   rejection of the gospel.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.440]   That's why I've selected this phrase in verse 14, "Beholding the men which was healed, standing
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   with them."
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.360]   They could say nothing against it, but they did say everything against it.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.800]   They couldn't, but they did.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.920]   That's unbelief.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.120]   It's utterly unreasonable.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.720]   Now this is the most important and vital thing.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.160]   What does it mean?
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.360]   Well, let me put it like this.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.520]   The man who rejects the gospel is not a man who's rejecting opinions.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.480]   He is rejecting facts.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.600]   And that is what is so frequently forgotten today.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   This is regarded as some sort of a point of view.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.400]   And so you can accept or reject a point of view.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.640]   But you know, when you're dealing with this, as I'm trying to point out every Sunday night,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.480]   you are dealing with facts.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.520]   This is about the things that have been seen and heard.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.520]   This is history.
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.800]   So you're dealing with hard facts.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:32.440]   And it's just when you realize that you see how completely unreasonable unbelief is.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.920]   It's put here in a very dramatic form.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:41.480]   "Beholding the men which was healed, standing with them."
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.120]   They could say nothing against it.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.120]   If they could have, they would have.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.080]   If they could have made that man lame again, they would have done it.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.440]   If they'd got an injection, they would have injected it into him and paralyzed him.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.560]   But they hadn't got it and they couldn't do it.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.120]   The wretched men were standing healed.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.480]   There he was before them.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:07.400]   And yet they're opposed and they reject and they try to put a ban on it and to silence it all.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.160]   Is there anybody who would try to argue that this is a reasonable procedure?
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.160]   Is there anybody who's trying to say that these Sanhedrin people were behaving in a
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.000]   irrational manner?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Is that rationality?
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.080]   Is this cold, calm, detached, scientific consideration of facts?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.240]   It's the exact opposite.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.840]   And they have to admit it themselves.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.480]   But you see, this is exactly what unbelief always does.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.240]   Now let me take all this and put it in a modern form to you.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.960]   Here, the people were confronted by the healed men, the fact.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   Facts are terrible things, aren't they?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.680]   If you're dealing with philosophies and theories and ideas, of course, it's all right.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.280]   You can go on arguing forever and forever and forever.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.640]   But a fact is a very stubborn thing.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.880]   And there was the fact standing before.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.560]   I want to use that in this way.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   Have you ever approached this problem, I wonder, like this?
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:10.320]   Tell me, what really can be said against this message?
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.240]   Have you ever thought of it like that?
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.120]   What can be said reasonably against this message?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.240]   Look at it like this.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:27.200]   What can you say against the person of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   Come along.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.840]   What have you got against him?
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.240]   Look at him.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.920]   Look at this blessed person that trod that land of Palestine.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.200]   Look at that young man acting as a carpenter.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.880]   Look at him at the age of 30 beginning to preach.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   Follow him along.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.120]   Look into his eyes.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   Come near him as these people did.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.400]   What's your objection to him?
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.000]   What's his defect?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.160]   What's lacking in him?
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.840]   What's wrong with him?
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.560]   Did he come into the world to blast it?
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.280]   Did he come into the world to destroy it?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.720]   He spends all his time in healing people, talking to the outcasts, sitting down and
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.760]   eating and drinking with the publicans and sinners.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   Look at him.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   Read his record.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.080]   Tell me in the name of reason, what have you got against him?
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:17.560]   Look at this person towering over the wrecks of Dain.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:23.360]   Look at this unique personality that is there dominating still the whole world, even the
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.880]   world that rejects him.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   They can't get rid of him.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   Look at him.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.240]   What's the objection to him?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.480]   What can be a possible objection to the Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:41.760]   I'd like to know on the grounds of reason what the objection is and then take his teaching.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.200]   Read his Sermon on the Mount, as we call it.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.600]   What's your objection to it?
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.960]   What's wrong with the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.440]   What's wrong with the sermon that tells you that you ought to be poor in spirit?
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.560]   If everybody in southern Rhodesia were poor in spirit, there'd be no problem there.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.840]   What's wrong with the man who says, "Blessed are the peacemakers.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.720]   Blessed are they that mourn.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.560]   Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness."
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.680]   What's wrong with this?
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   Come along.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.240]   If you say you're a reasonable person and you reject this gospel because you're a reasonable
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   person, I want you to adduce your reasons.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   Why?
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.720]   What's unreasonable about the Sermon on the Mount?
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.560]   Go right through with it.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.080]   His treatment of murder, his treatment of adultery, his treatment of arms giving, his
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.280]   treatment of everything.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.240]   What is the objection to it?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.120]   On the grounds of reason, I ask you, produce them.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.800]   Then go back to your Old Testament.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.800]   Read your Ten Commandments.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   What's wrong with them?
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.800]   What's your objection to the Ten Commandments?
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.320]   Do you object to a commandment which says, "Thou shalt not kill"?
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.360]   Do you object to a commandment which says, "Thou shalt not steal"?
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.520]   What are your rational objections to the commandment that says, "Thou shalt not commit adultery"?
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.360]   What's wrong with it?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.600]   Why is it unreasonable to believe something like that and to try to put it into practice?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.100]   What's wrong with a commandment that tells you that you mustn't bring a false testimony
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.160]   against anybody?
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.760]   What's wrong with a commandment that tells you you mustn't covet your neighbor's wife
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.520]   or his ox or his ass or his manservant or his maidservant?
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.960]   What's wrong with it in the name of reason?
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.600]   My dear friends, don't you realize this?
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.240]   If the whole world tonight and every individual in it was only living life according to the
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.840]   dictates of the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, this world would be paradise.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.680]   There'd be no need to argue about whether we should have armies east of Suez or whether
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.880]   we should be making bombs or doing this or that.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.280]   There'd be no problem if only the whole world lived according to this.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:57.600]   Well, why do you reject it then and claim that you're being reasonable as you do so?
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.400]   Can't you see that it's the opposite of reason?
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   And then let me go along.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.160]   Let me put before you this great message of salvation that is the heart of this message.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:17.080]   Here is a word that tells you that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:25.000]   Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.960]   Here is a message that tells you that the world is as it is because of its rebellion
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   against God and because of its fall from him, that it's brought all these calamities upon
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.560]   itself in its arrogant rebellion against God.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:48.240]   But that in spite of that, God has sent his only Son into the world.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.440]   Not prophets, not men raised up, he did that.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.160]   But now he has sent his only begotten Son from the courts of heaven and the unmixed
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.040]   bliss of eternity.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.440]   He has told him to humble himself and to be born as a man, to be born of the womb of a
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.880]   virgin and the Son has said, "Here I am, send me."
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.960]   And he humbled himself and came in the likeness of men and took upon him the form of a servant
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.600]   and he humbled himself even further.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.480]   You remember the story?
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.680]   This is a message that tells you that because of God's great love, because he was sorry
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.320]   for men and women in a state of sin and with all the calamities that they brought upon
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.960]   themselves, his love was so great that he sent his only Son into it and said, "Take
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.320]   humanity upon you, start a new human race, rescue them, deliver them."
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.720]   And he came saying, "The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost."
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.560]   He spoke, he taught, he gave an example, he revealed his divinity, his deity in his acts
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:56.680]   of healing and then he set his face deathlessly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:04.800]   He deliberately went to death because the only way whereby he could save any one of
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.680]   us was to bear our punishment.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:13.360]   And the message is one that tells us that he did so, that the Son of God loved me and
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.320]   gave himself for me.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.920]   God took my sins and laid them on him and he punished him with the punishment that I
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   deserve.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.600]   That's the message, that the innocent spotless Son of God against whom nobody could bring
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.160]   any charge at all for there was no charge to bring, they hadn't got a vestige of evidence
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.440]   against him, nothing at all, the authorities even have got to admit it at that point, and
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.880]   yet away he goes and he went willingly and he's doing it to bear the punishment of
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.960]   my sins that I may be forgiven, that I may be reconciled to God, that I may become a
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.840]   child of God and an heir of eternal bliss.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.520]   Here is a message that tells you that.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.560]   What's your objection to it?
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.480]   What's your objection to the love of God?
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.720]   That love which is so amazing, so divine?
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.400]   That love that spared not his own son but delivered him up from us all?
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.680]   What's your objection to it?
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.440]   Come, you reasonable men, what's your objection to this love of God sacrificing his only begotten
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   Son?
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   Reason.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:25.880]   It's the antithesis of reason.
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:33.160]   And especially when I remind you that this great message goes on to say this, that because
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:41.920]   of all that God has done for you in his Son, you have nothing to do but to believe the
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.800]   message and you're immediately forgiven and accepted of God.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.760]   You don't have to go and fast and sweat and pray, it's a free gift from God, it's all
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:59.120]   of grace and you can have it just as you are at this moment without any preparation at
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   all, without your doing anything.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.720]   You come as a pauper, you come empty-handed.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:09.800]   It tells you that, that just as you are, you can be forgiven, cleansed, renewed and made
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:15.560]   a new man and given a blessed hope that can never fade away.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.320]   What's your objection to it, my friends?
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.800]   What is your objection in terms of reason?
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.520]   Why do men reject this?
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.480]   I say it is the very opposite and antithesis of that which is reasonable and rational.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.000]   Accept it.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.960]   Think of the results of believing and accepting this message.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.280]   Look at its effect in individuals.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.040]   Look at them as you see them here in the Bible.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.920]   Look at them as you see them in the running history of the church throughout the centuries.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.520]   Oh, it's the most amazing story.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:55.760]   Vile and vile, desperate men suddenly changed, suddenly delivered from all that got them
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.800]   down, made happy and rejoicing.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.520]   Oh, it's been one of the most romantic stories of the whole of history.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   Reformation of character.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.600]   Thank God I've often been privileged to see it.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.960]   I've known men who were hopeless drunkards and wife-beaters and adulterers and who only
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.000]   stopped short of murder, slaves of sin.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.480]   I've known them as saints and as great gentlemen.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.640]   God produced the change.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.640]   The probation officer?
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   No, no.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.560]   They passed through his hands for years.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   Psychological treatment?
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.200]   Doesn't touch them.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:43.240]   The appeals of wife and children, fathers-in-law, mothers-in-law, fathers, brothers, sisters,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.000]   nothing could touch them.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.320]   But this message did, and completely changed them, made them saints of God, made them noble
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:00.480]   citizens, not only of the kingdom of God, but even of the kingdom of this world.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.040]   And so, you see, this is this great story.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   The power of the gospel unto salvation, to change men and to deliver them and to set
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   them free.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.480]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.440]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.640]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.280]   His blood availed for me.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.960]   What's your objection?
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.200]   Isn't this the greatest need of the hour?
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:32.800]   You see the misery and the unhappiness caused by drink and drugs and sex and adultery?
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.880]   Oh, the unhappiness in the world tonight because of these things.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.360]   And the men and women who are guilty of them are poor, helpless victims.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.640]   There are many of them who'd give the world if they could only be freed, but they can't.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.480]   Here's a message that delivers.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:56.240]   The man standing whole and there standing before you are the saints of the centuries.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.880]   And if you reject the gospel, you're rejecting it in the face of that evidence.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.920]   But come, let me put it like this.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.840]   Take the story of the church in general, if you like.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   How has she persisted?
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.160]   How has she kept going?
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.480]   Can you really dismiss the story of the revivals of history in the life of the church?
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.760]   No, no, you can't explain the church.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:22.320]   If mankind could put an end to the church, they'd have done so.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.200]   They'd have done so here at the beginning.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.720]   If it were in the power of men to put an end to this, if it were but a human institution,
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.800]   it would long since have been finished.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.180]   It would never have survived the first century.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:38.120]   But it's gone on in spite of these powers, in spite of princes and kings, in spite of
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   church councils, in spite of popes and bishops and archbishops, in spite of all their malignity
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.880]   and power and hatred, the church has gone on.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   Why?
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.320]   Well, because it's God acting in her.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.000]   And that is the only adequate explanation.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.800]   So you're running in the face of that.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   And then think of it like this.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.080]   Think of what the Christian church has done in this world.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.440]   I'm simply arguing facts with you.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.200]   I think any honest, dispassionate man, any true historian, has got to admit that the
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:21.920]   Christian church has been the greatest civilizing force that the world has ever known.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.200]   She has been the greatest benefactor that mankind has ever known.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.360]   We are boasting so much of our education today, and all the advantages of education.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Thank God for them.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.720]   Do you know who began educating poor people?
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.440]   The Christian church.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.400]   You'd never have had it but for the Christian church.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   And look at your hospitals.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.280]   National Health Scheme.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.480]   Who began treating the sick, and especially the poor, sick?
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.160]   The answer is still the same, the Christian church.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.880]   The oldest hospital in London tonight is St. Bartholomew's Hospital.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:03.480]   It was founded by a monk over eight centuries ago.
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.400]   Who started your poor law relief?
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   The Christian church.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   You see, that's what you're rejecting.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   Of course we think we're so clever.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.400]   Nothing in it we say, "Play it up."
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   But that's prejudice.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.400]   Why don't you face the facts?
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   Here's the man standing before you all.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   Look at these facts.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   Look at what the Christian church has done along all these lines throughout the running
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   centuries.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   There has been nothing comparable to what the church has achieved.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.400]   The saints of the Christian church stand out as the world's greatest and best benefactors.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   And I'm not saying that's the only way.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   I'm saying that the Christian church has been the greatest civilizing force that the
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   world has ever known.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.400]   And I'm not saying that the Christian church has been the greatest civilizing force that

[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.040]   My dear friend, do you see this?
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.120]   You're not rejecting a human theory.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.760]   You are rejecting what God, the eternal God, has actually done.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.040]   The acts of God.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.480]   The marvelous works of God.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.400]   Read of it here as you see it.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.000]   The only explanation of human history.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Look at these facts again.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.560]   You're resisting and rejecting God, not men.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.600]   It's a defiance of God.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.480]   And that's what makes it so terrible.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   Let me ask as I close therefore this question, what's the explanation of this?
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.120]   Why can men behave in such an utterly unreasonable manner?
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:54.240]   How does it come to pass that intelligent, able people can in this amazing, astonishing,
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:01.040]   prejudiced, blinded manner refuse to face the facts and just go on asserting their negative
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.000]   dogmatism?
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.760]   What makes a man do a thing like that?
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.320]   There's only one explanation.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.520]   It's the one given in the Bible.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:18.000]   When men disobeyed God and rebelled against him and fell, all his faculties were affected.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.640]   They all became twisted.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:22.040]   They were all perverted.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.200]   And the supreme tragedy of men is that he can no longer think straightly.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.640]   They are proving it.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:31.960]   There's nothing so unreasonable, so irrational.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.840]   Trying to twist and turn, trying to explain away, but can't do it, and then just asserting
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.200]   dogmatically and using their power.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:46.680]   I say there's only one thing that makes a human being behave like that, and that is
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:53.960]   the Bible tells us about him, that he has become the slave of the devil, the slave of
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.800]   lusts and passions and desires.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.120]   He hates God.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.640]   He doesn't want to live the life of God.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.560]   He prefers to go on as he is.
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.560]   He can't believe the gospel.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.120]   He's not allowed to believe the gospel.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.760]   "If our gospel be hid," says Paul, "it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:14.960]   God of this world hath blinded the eyes and the minds of them that believe not, lest they
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:15.960]   believe."
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   This is the most terrible thing.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:22.320]   A man who rejects the gospel is rejecting it because the devil will not allow him to
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   believe it.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:26.440]   He won't allow him to think straightly.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:32.680]   He's held in bondage and captivity by the God of this world, who blinds the mind and
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   the understanding.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.680]   It's the only explanation.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:37.200]   Is there any hope for such a creature?
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:42.920]   Ah, it is, you see, still in this old gospel.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:50.040]   The one you've rejected until this moment is the only one who can save you, and blessed
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.120]   be his name, he's still ready to do it.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.520]   He knows all about you.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:01.600]   He knows your pathetic, blinded, servile state.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.480]   That's why he came from heaven.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.880]   He'll take you still.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:10.920]   Though you've rejected him and arrogantly have dismissed him and spat upon him, you
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.000]   turn back to him.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.800]   He'll still receive you.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:19.400]   Oh, my dear friends, may I put the appeal to you in the words of Peter?
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   "Judge ye."
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.240]   "It's all right," said Peter.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.600]   Here's the Sanhedrin saying to Peter and John, "You mustn't do this."
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.040]   Peter replies saying, "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.360]   than unto God, judge ye."
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:38.400]   Now, I like a translation which puts it like this.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:46.240]   "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God is
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:53.280]   your decision, and you will have to answer him, not us."
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:54:00.360]   Or another translation, "Judge for yourselves and take the consequences of your decision."
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:05.120]   "As for us," said Peter, "we must obey God.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.520]   We dare not do anything else.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:11.440]   Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men, and we've got a message that has ravished
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.160]   our hearts and changed us.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.960]   We know it can do the same to others.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.480]   We've judged for ourselves.
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.600]   We've taken our decision, and we're prepared to abide by the consequences.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:24.480]   If the consequence of our decision is that you put us to death, well, that's all right.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   We're ready for it.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.040]   But as for us, we are going on.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.480]   We cannot stop speaking.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.560]   We must."
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:45.400]   And as for you, "Judge for yourselves and take the consequences of your decision."
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:49.080]   And I say that to you tonight in the name of God.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.960]   There's the man standing before you whole.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   It's a fact.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.800]   I've told you the facts.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.880]   Look at the man.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.920]   Look at the one who's put him on his feet.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.600]   Look at them.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:21.640]   "Judge for yourselves and bear in mind the consequences of your decision."
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.720]   You reject them, you'll probably be popular in the common room tomorrow morning, or in
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:35.280]   the bar parlor, or in the office of the work.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.280]   But they are not your judge.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:44.920]   God is your judge, and you'll have to reduce your reasons to him.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.160]   On the other hand, believe the fact.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.000]   Believe in the one who's done it, and give yourself to him.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.720]   The world will probably laugh at you, and deride you, or perhaps pity.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.680]   It doesn't matter.
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:05.320]   You will already have passed from judgment into life.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.040]   You will have no need to fear life.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.520]   You will have no need to fear death.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.440]   You will have no need to fear the judgment.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:20.080]   You will become a child of God, and an heir of eternal bliss.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:27.160]   And you, like Peter and John, will want to live henceforth to the glory and the praise
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:35.200]   of this blessed Son of God, who loved you and gave himself for you.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:46.080]   God is your judge.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   The closing hymn is hymn number 477.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   477.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:57.240]   Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:04.080]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which frow'd be of sin, the double cure,
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:19.760]   cleanse me from its guilt and power.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:39.880]   Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:59.560]   Let the water and the blood from thy riven side which frow'd be of sin, the double cure,
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:09.400]   cleanse me from its guilt and power.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:22.520]   Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   Rock of ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in thee.
