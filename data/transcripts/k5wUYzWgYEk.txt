[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   Let us pray. Almighty God, our Heavenly Father, we come to Thee once more. We
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.160]   thank Thee that Thou hast ever looked upon us and called us into Thy kingdom
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.600]   and called us to be preachers of Thy Word. We realize, O Lord, the greatness of
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.240]   this office and we realize our need of help and instruction. We therefore thank
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.960]   Thee that once more we come together to consider Thy Word and its teaching in
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.760]   these matters. We humbly pray Thee, therefore, to look upon us and to bless
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.520]   us. Take from us, O Lord, prejudices, preconceived ideas. Grant us all that
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.680]   humility of spirit that will enable us to realize the greatness of the task. It
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.840]   is indeed a high calling and we pray that we may realize this and so prepare
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   ourselves for it in every way that is open to us. We pray Thee, therefore, to
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.320]   bless our further consideration of these matters together. We ask it in the name
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   of Thy dear Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.160]   Well, now, we are still looking at this whole picture in general of a man
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.960]   standing in a pulpit and preaching to a number of people and we've arrived at
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.440]   the point when we've looked at the preacher and his preparation and what he
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.160]   has to do in general. But now it seems to me to be equally essential that we should
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.480]   look at the people who are listening to him, the people who are sitting in the
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   pews. After all, he is preaching to them. He's not just getting up there, as I've
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.520]   indicated, to voice certain of his own ideas and opinions, nor to give any kind
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.200]   of theoretical or academic disquisition on the teaching of the Scripture. He is
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.120]   there primarily to address the people who've come together in order to listen
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.240]   to him and to what he's got to say. So this raises the question, for me to put
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.200]   it in the form of a question, what is the relationship between the pew and the
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.560]   pulpit, between the people who listen and the men who is preaching? This, of
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   course, has become quite an acute problem at this present time and in a new way.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   The old traditional idea of this relationship seems to be going. It's
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.480]   being questioned, itinerated, and queried very seriously. And clearly this has
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.720]   reference to the last subject which we dealt with, which was the training of the
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.520]   preacher. Obviously the relationship between the pew and the pulpit is going
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.920]   to have its effect upon the training of the preacher, and this is something that
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.240]   is being manifested in practice at the present time. Now, there can be no doubt
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.160]   at all that the new factor in this matter is that the great emphasis today
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.000]   is being placed upon the pew. In the past, let's admit there may have been too
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.120]   much of a tendency for the pulpit to be almost independent of the pew, and the
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.200]   people in the pew perhaps revered the preacher, sometimes almost to the point
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   of idolatry. You remember the story perhaps of the poor woman going out of a
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.320]   service in the famous church in Edinburgh, where a great and learned
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.760]   professor had been preaching, and somebody asked her on the way out whether
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   she'd enjoyed the service, and she said she had, and then he asked her were you
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.560]   able to follow him. She said, "Far be it from me to presume to understand such a
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   great man as that." Now that was the old attitude, you see, but that has gone.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.520]   That's no longer the case, and we are now in a new position in which the pew is
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.000]   asserting itself, and I think more or less trying to dictate to the pulpit.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.920]   This is something which is stated in many different ways. I've got some
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.640]   statements of it here from different angles. One man, for instance, says, "The
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.480]   world is dying for want not of good preaching but of good hearing." That's a
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.840]   criticism of the listening of the pew, and so he feels that the great problem
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.360]   today is good hearing, not good preaching. But then the real emphasis is this
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.000]   emphasis upon modern men and the modern situation confronting us. Here are
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.640]   statements made by a theologian who is becoming popular, not to say notorious,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:07.240]   on the continent of Europe. He says, "Moreover, it is of no genuine help to a
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.800]   Christian trying to find his way through God's world of this day and this place."
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.160]   That's a criticism which he has of the traditional theology and the traditional
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.600]   type of preaching. "It is of no genuine help to a Christian trying to find his
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.160]   way through God's world of this day and this place." Or again, "A great many
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.000]   Christians, convinced that faith and works are inseparable, are nonetheless
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.760]   unable to discover for themselves how to focus this unity on the issues of our
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:53.600]   time." This is it. This is the emphasis. Or again, "We have to know the issues which
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.520]   which are at stake in our time and place. It is here and nowhere else that the
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.040]   truth must be done." You see the obvious emphasis. Here and now, the situation
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.560]   today, the men of today, and you're familiar with this emphasis in a man
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.080]   like Bultman, whose basic argument for demythologizing is that you cannot
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.760]   expect the modern men with a scientific background to believe the gospel, the
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.240]   message which he says he is anxious to convey, as long as it is tied up with a
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.600]   miraculous and so on, which the modern men cannot possibly accept. In other
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.800]   words, you see, it's what the modern men can accept that becomes the determining
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.960]   factor. And we're all familiar with this teaching about men come of age and so on.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:58.200]   Well now, I want to show how in practice this kind of attitude and mentality
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:06.760]   tends to express itself. It does so in the approach to what we may call the
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.840]   ordinary people. And concerning these we are told that today they can't think and
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:21.040]   follow reasoned statements. That they're so accustomed to the kind of outlook and
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.160]   mentality inculcated by newspapers and the television and the films and so on,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.840]   that they're incapable of following a reasoned argued statement. And that
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.040]   therefore we must give them films and film strips and get film stars to speak
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.200]   to them and give them more singing and brief addresses with just a word of
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.240]   gospel thrown in. You create your atmosphere, that's the great thing, and
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.040]   then just get a very brief word of gospel in at the end. But it also takes
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.120]   this form that we are told that these people cannot understand the biblical
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.960]   terminology. That to talk about justification and sanctification and
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.520]   glorification is meaningless to them. That we are living in a kind of
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.960]   post-christian era and that this is the greatest obstacle today, that people
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.000]   don't understand our terms. They sound archaic to them, they're not modern,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.880]   they're not up-to-date. So there is this great craze for new translations of the
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:35.760]   scriptures in familiar, ordinary, everyday language and a tendency no longer to
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:43.000]   address God as "thee" and "thou" but "you". This we are told is all-important. But to the
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.400]   modern man to hear "thee" and "thou" almost makes it impossible for him to listen to
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.840]   the gospel, even learn to believe it. So we've got to change our language and we
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.600]   do this in our translations of the scriptures and in our prayers and in
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.920]   general in all our preaching and religious activity. That's how all this
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.040]   modern attitude which emphasizes the pew as controlling the pulpit expresses
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.480]   itself with regard to the ordinary person. Then when you come to the
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.520]   intellectuals, what we are told about them is of course that they are now
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:26.760]   scientific. That they therefore accept the theory of evolution and so on and this
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.680]   whole scientific outlook as it's called and therefore that we must make it
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.160]   clear to them that the Bible only deals with matters of salvation or the
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.200]   religious life, that it doesn't touch anything else and that if we don't do
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.520]   this we'll offend this kind of modern intellectualist, this modern scientist
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.480]   type particularly and they won't listen to the gospel. So we've got to stop
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.240]   talking as we have in the past about the origin of the world and of men and so on
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.000]   and we've got to concentrate on this religious message. Of course there's
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.760]   nothing new about this in a sense. Richel did all this in the last century but
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.520]   it's now come up in a new form. Then another thing we are told is this,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.720]   that we've got to realize that the modern men, this intellectual type is
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.320]   sophisticated and that he thinks in terms of modern literature and modern
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.520]   art and modern drama, novels and so on and that unless we can address him in
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.200]   this idiom with which he is familiar we are not likely to make any impact on him
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.440]   at all, that this is what controls his thinking. We had an extraordinary
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:52.480]   illustration of this attitude in a review of a book not many months ago in
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.640]   a religious periodical in Great Britain where the man ended his review by saying
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.880]   that he thought now that if all preachers only read this book there would
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.680]   be a new hope for preaching because this book would force preachers to realize
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   that they had better spend their Saturday nights in watching what is
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.760]   called in our country Saturday night theater and then having watched Saturday
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.040]   night theater they'd know the mentality and the outlook and the jargon of the
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.720]   modern men and therefore they'd be able to preach to him in a better way on the
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.280]   Sunday. So this is the way you see in which you prepare Saturday night theater
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.920]   familiar with the modern outlook. And then the other form which it takes is
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   this, that this modern sophisticated men has a particular dislike of dogmatic
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:49.040]   assertions and that he will not have these dogmatic pulpit pronouncements, that
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.160]   he's a learned man, he's not to be talked down to, he's the equal of the men in the
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.960]   pulpit probably the superior, and that he believes in examining in things
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.320]   carefully and rationally and putting up the different sides. Indeed I read in a
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.480]   in a magazine belonging to an evangelical students organization not so
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:14.080]   long ago a plea to the effect that what the pulpit really should be doing now is
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.680]   to read out portions of scripture particularly in the newer translations
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.160]   and make a few comments and then invite questions and have a discussion and so
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.760]   you have an intelligent service. Instead of this one man standing up and laying
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.080]   down the laws it were and telling other people all about it. This participation
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.160]   on the part of the people. So the man in the pulpit really is just there to read
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.440]   the scriptures in an intelligent slow manner according to these different
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:52.720]   translations and then the discussion. There is the sort of statement of the
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.380]   mentality and the outlook. Then in a very practical way as regards the training of
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:06.520]   ministers it comes out in this form that there are those who say that a man is
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:14.680]   not rarely fit to preach to an industrial community unless he has had a
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.640]   certain amount of factory experience himself and there has been a proposal
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.880]   quite seriously that all ministers having finished their academic training
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.920]   should then go and work in a factory say for six months in order that they might
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.120]   get to understand the outlook and the mentality of the factory worker that
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.780]   they might get to understand his language and how he expresses himself
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.260]   and that it is well and I impossible for him to preach to them unless he has had
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:52.140]   this experience. Now there I've stated the position to you in general and the
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.340]   question before us is what are we to say to this to what extent is the pulpit is
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:04.000]   the pew to control the pulpit. Well I want to suggest to you that this new
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.720]   kind of thinking about these matters is entirely wrong completely wrong and I'll
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.560]   give you some reasons for that statement. Let me divide my answers into general
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:22.040]   and more particular. I say it's wrong in general in this way. I say first of all
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:30.080]   that it's wrong in fact. It is wrong in experience I mean by that. It is wrong in
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:37.480]   its whole psychological understanding of the situation. Let me elaborate that. I
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.800]   shall never forget and I put it in this form because I think it helps to make
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.000]   the point clear. I shall never forget preaching oh some 25 years ago I suppose
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.520]   if not more at a college chapel in the University of Oxford on a Sunday morning
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:04.500]   and I had preached in exactly the same way as I preach anywhere else. I want to
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.920]   take up this point I gather some of you are a bit troubled about this and when
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.880]   we come to discussion I should be very glad to have this out with you. It seems
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.440]   to me there's a lot of confusion just at this point. However I preached as I say
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.360]   as I would have preached anywhere else. The moment I'd finished before I'd had
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.040]   time to get down from the pulpit the wife of the principal came rushing on to
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:34.760]   me and said you know she said this is the most remarkable thing I've ever
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.960]   known in this chapel. I said what you mean? Well she said do you know that you
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.440]   are literally the first man I ever heard in this chapel who was preached to us as
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.880]   if we were sinners. She said all the people who come here because it's a
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.240]   college chapel in Oxford they come and they've obviously been taking
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.720]   exceptional pains to prepare learned intellectual sermons thinking we're all
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.680]   great intellect she said. She said to start with the poor fellows sure that
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.880]   they haven't too much intellect to start with but they've obviously been
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   straining and producing the last ounce that they can and she said we go away
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:21.120]   absolutely unfed. We've listened to these essays she said and our souls are left
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.920]   unfed. They don't seem to understand that though we live in Oxford that we are
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.800]   nevertheless sinners. Now that was a statement of fact. The wife of the
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.760]   principal of the college. I remember a poor man, good man he'd done good work in
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:46.520]   a sort of industrial church in an industrial area. He then got a call to a
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:53.680]   church in the suburb of another town and I remember noticing after a while he
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:58.340]   came into the presbytery that I happened to be in. I noticed after a while the men
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.440]   was beginning to look tired and strained. I talked to him about this we were
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.160]   talking together one day and he admitted that he was very strained. I said what's
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   the matter? I said you've had experience. He'd been a number of years in the other
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.600]   church and very successful. Ah well you see he says he said I've got I've got a
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.640]   different type of congregation now. I've got these people who are living in the
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.480]   suburbs. Some of them were professional people others were business people who
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.320]   had done well and had moved from living over their shop and gone out into these
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.640]   suburbs and here he was poor fellow trying to produce these great
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:42.120]   intellectual sermons. Well what actually happened was this that his people were
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:48.480]   complaining about the dryness of his preaching. It wasn't what they wanted and
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.080]   indeed I have very little hesitation in saying that the poor man ultimately
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.240]   killed himself. His health broke down and he died at a comparatively early age
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   through having this entirely wrong notion. It wasn't what the people
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:10.720]   expected at all and indeed one is constantly being given surprises. Take
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.320]   this inability that we are told of people today in general to listen to
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:22.240]   sermons and so on and long sermons. I was ill a year ago and received a number of
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.440]   letters during my illness but the letter that I shall always treasure more than
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.080]   any other is this and mark you I'm considered to be a not too easy a
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.000]   preacher to listen to. I tend to be long and I certainly don't spend my time in
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.940]   telling stories. However the letter that I prize was a letter from a little girl
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.800]   aged ten writing on behalf of herself and her brother unbeknown to their
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.560]   parents saying that they were praying for my recovery and hoping that I would
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.040]   soon be back in the pulpit and then she gave the reason which pleased me so much.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.920]   She said because you were the only preacher that we understand. Now that
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.720]   isn't the reputation I have in Great Britain. The average evangelical
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   in Great Britain would say that I am not an easy preacher that I'm too much of a
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:14.200]   teacher and that there's too much reason and they never take their newly
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.940]   converted friends to listen to me or advise somebody who seems to be under
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.900]   conviction to come to me to say it's been too much. They wouldn't be able to
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.280]   follow and so on. But here's a child aged ten. She says you are the only preacher
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.320]   that we understand. I'm sure she's right.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:37.720]   And then and then to to enforce this still further. I've had this experience I
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.440]   don't know how many times people have come to me who have been converted and
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.960]   have then gone on and have grown in the church and then somehow or another
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.160]   something some occasion has given them an opportunity of telling me what
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.960]   happened to them and this is what I've been told so often. They said you know
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.760]   when we first came we really didn't understand much of what you were talking
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.920]   about. Well then I said what made you come? They said there was something
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.480]   about the whole atmosphere that attracted us and made us feel that it
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:17.120]   was right. Then they said this made us come and we gradually began to find that
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.880]   we were absorbing it unconsciously. It began to get meaning for us more and
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.880]   more. Still they wouldn't get much out of a summer but they'd get something and
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.680]   that something was of great value and on and on they'd grown in their
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.520]   understanding until now they were able to enjoy the full service and the full
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.720]   message. This is this is a very common experience. People at different levels
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.640]   seem to be able to extract under the influence of the spirit what they need
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   and what is helpful to them and so you can preach like this to this mixed
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.320]   congregation of varying intellects and understanding and knowledge and so on.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.800]   But then I would say that this modern idea is also quite false to the
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.040]   tradition of the centuries. You see we are not the only people who have lived
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.000]   in this world. We tend to talk as if we were of course or that we are some
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.240]   peculiar special race but there have been people in this world always and
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.080]   you've always had these different types. But this is what Luther has to say about
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.440]   the subject. A preacher, says Luther, should have the skill to teach the
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   unlearned simply, roundly and plainly for teaching is of more importance than
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:40.480]   exhorting. Then he says when I preach I regard neither doctors nor magistrates
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.520]   of whom I have above 40 in the congregation. I have all my eyes on the
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.960]   servant maids and the children and if the learned men are not well pleased
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:59.040]   with what they hear well the door is open. Martin Luther and I think Luther
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:07.160]   was undoubtedly right. Some of you doctors perhaps have felt like that, that
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.200]   not sufficient attention was being paid to you when the preacher was in the
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.120]   pulpit. But the wise preacher he keeps his eye you see on the servant maids and
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.320]   the children and if this great learned man feels he doesn't get anything well
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:28.000]   he's condemning himself. He's condemning himself. He's not spiritually minded. He
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.720]   isn't able to receive spiritual truth. He's so puffed up and blown up with his
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.120]   head knowledge that he's forgotten that he's got a heart and he's got a soul. He
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   condemns himself and if he walks out well he is the loser. Let me again
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.640]   enforce this point by telling you of an incident which I had strangely enough
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.640]   again in that University of Oxford. I was invited to preach in a mission there in
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.720]   1941 and I did so and it fell to my lot to preach on the Sunday night the first
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.280]   service of the mission in the famous pulpit of Cardinal Newman, afterwards
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.840]   Cardinal Newman. St. Mary's Church where he preached when he was in the Church of
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:16.620]   England and of course it was a congregation chiefly of students. But
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.600]   again I preached to them as I had preached anywhere else and as I would
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:26.520]   have preached anywhere else and it had been arranged that if people had any
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:31.320]   questions to put that an opportunity would be given to them if they retired
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:38.240]   to another building at the back of the church after the service had ended. So we
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.020]   the vicar and I went along expecting just a few people but we found the place
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.440]   packed out and then he took the chair and he asked if there were any questions.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.280]   The bright young men sitting in the very front whom I discovered afterwards was
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.480]   going in for law and was one of the chief officials at the famous Oxford
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.400]   University Union Debating Society where the budding statesmen and so on learn
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.000]   the art of speech and of debate and so on. He's sitting in the front, he's very
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.080]   dressed, betrayed what he was, he got up immediately and said he'd got a question
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.720]   to put and he put it in a very charming manner. He tried to pay the preacher some
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.400]   compliments and so on and that he'd much enjoyed it but there was one great
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.400]   difficulty in his mind and the difficulty was this. He rarely couldn't see but that
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.880]   that sermon which he'd listened to, which he admitted was well constructed and
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:38.440]   well presented, he couldn't see really but that that sermon might equally well
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:45.800]   have been delivered to a congregation of farm labourers, agricultural workers and
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.520]   sat down and the place roared with laughter. So the chairman turned to me for my
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.760]   reply and the reply I gave was this and it's still the reply. I said that I was
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.960]   most interested in this question and really couldn't see his difficulty
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.600]   because I had to admit that I might be a heretic but I had to admit that until
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.240]   that moment I regarded the undergraduates and indeed the graduates
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.960]   of Oxford University as just being ordinary common human clay like
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:23.800]   everybody else and that their needs were precisely the same as the agricultural
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:30.640]   labourer so that I had done what I had done quite deliberately. Well this again
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.680]   provoked a good deal of mirth and laughter but the point was that they
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.200]   appreciated what I was saying and I was invited as the result of that to have
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.160]   the debate to which I referred in a previous lecture with the famous Dr.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.880]   Joan but that was how that occasion arose. You see this is the fallacy
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.840]   that you've got these special types. The facts have proved throughout the
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   centuries that what is needed by them all is this same kind of message, same
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.000]   kind of preaching and you get it coming out in the Ministry of Preachers like
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.680]   Spurgeon and people like that but I want in the third place to show you that this
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.560]   modern idea is really based on false thinking and this to me is very
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:23.000]   important. It seems to assume that the difficulty and the trouble with the
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.280]   modern men, the thing that prevents his believing the gospel, is almost entirely
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:37.720]   a problem of language and of terminology. This seems to be the reason behind much
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.400]   of this thinking. Now let me say at once of course we all must believe in having
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:47.940]   the best translations possible. We mustn't be obscurantist in these matters.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:56.680]   Let's have the best that the translators can give us but that you see is to miss
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:04.400]   the real point. This idea now that you've got to address God as you rather than
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.720]   thee or thou. If you don't do that that it's going to make the preaching almost
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.560]   impossible. The people won't be able to listen. You see the assumption here that
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   the reason these people don't believe in God and don't pray to him is this
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.680]   archaic language and if only that is put right well then a great difference would
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.400]   be made and they would be able to believe these things. But the answer is
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:35.440]   this. People have always found this language strange. This idea that people
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.820]   today don't understand justification, sanctification and all the rest of it.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.400]   The answer to that is when did they understand it? When did the unbeliever
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.160]   understand this language? The answer is never. This is something peculiar and
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:56.000]   special. It is our business to show that our gospel is essentially different and
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.320]   we are not talking about ordinary matters. We are talking about something
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:07.040]   unique and special and different and people are to expect this and we are to
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.480]   assert this and our business is to teach them the meaning of these terms. They
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.920]   don't determine. It's we. We've got the revelation and we've got to make this
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:22.360]   understood. You see that was the great principle of the Protestant reformers.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.240]   That's why they produced their new translations. They wanted the message as
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.160]   they put it to be understanded of the people. So you explain it. It is the
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.800]   business of preaching to do this. You shouldn't expect people to understand
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.400]   these terms. The whole point of your preaching is to give them this
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:50.600]   understanding. And then you see the other false bit of argument is this. This idea
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.920]   that we've got to know the exact condition of people before we can
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.000]   properly preach to them. And therefore as I say that you may have to go and work
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.720]   in a factory for six months before you can preach to factory workers. Well now
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.360]   this seems to me to be monstrous because if this is true and is pressed to its
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.960]   logical conclusion well then you are training will never have been finished.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.480]   Because if you're to preach to drunkards you'll have to spend six months in the
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.040]   drinking saloons and so on. You'll have to go around all the various grades and
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.520]   differences and departments and spend six months in each lot. And then and then
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:38.120]   only will you be ready to preach to them. But the thing I say is quite ridiculous.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.880]   Because if you press that it surely would lead to this. That you could never
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.920]   preach to a mixed general congregation. You would have to have one service, one
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:56.680]   congregation of the non-intellectuals. Then you'd have to have a special
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.640]   service for the intellectuals. Then you'd have to have one probably for those who
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.160]   are somewhere in between. And then you might have to have them for different
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.240]   ages. And then whether they're factory workers or professional people and so on.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   Well the result is you see you'd be dividing up and atomizing your
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.200]   congregation. You'd never have a public act of worship and a sermon preached to
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.680]   all. You'd have to be dividing yourself up in this way. And your work would be
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:27.640]   endless. And in any case it would be destructive of this great fundamental
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.800]   principle of the New Testament that we're all one. As there is neither Jew
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.840]   nor Gentile, barbarian or Scythian, bond nor free, male nor female. I add there is
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.760]   neither intellectual nor non-intellectual. Factory worker, professional men or
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   anything else. We are all one in sin, one in failure, one in hopelessness. It's to
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:58.120]   ignore all that. Well let me put that to you in this different form. Having spent
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:04.680]   the first part of my adult life as a physician in medicine, I've often been
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.520]   interested in the difference between the work of the physician and the work of
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.560]   the preacher. And there is a very striking difference. Of course there are
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.960]   similarities but the thing itself is essentially different. And the difference
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:28.000]   comes out in this way. What does the medical physician do? Well the first
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.600]   thing he does of course is to ask the patient to give him an account of his
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   symptoms and his troubles, his aches and his pains, where it was, how long he's had
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.040]   it, how it began, has it varied. All this he has to go into in great detail. Takes
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.280]   the history of the case. Having done that he takes the family history. It may throw
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:57.320]   considerable light upon this particular ailment. It may be a familial disease and
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:04.560]   so on. So the family history is also very important. And then of course he proceeds
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.280]   to make his examination. Now without this detailed, specific, special, personal
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:16.480]   knowledge, the physician cannot do his work. And it's at this point I say there
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:22.040]   is such a striking contrast between the work of the physician and that of the
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:30.720]   preacher. The preacher does not need to know these personal facts concerning his
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:38.960]   congregation. This is a point of course that comes up in another connection.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.120]   Because people who are interested in giving testimonies and to believe in the
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.280]   value of that and so on, they attach great significance to this. That and
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.920]   here's of somebody else who had his weakness and sin and so on, here's a man
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.360]   getting up and saying how he was delivered from that, he was helped and so
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.920]   forth. Well now I say the difference is this, the preacher doesn't need to know
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:07.560]   this. Why not? Well because he knows that all these people are suffering from the
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:14.200]   same disease, which is sin, every one of them. The symptoms may vary tremendously
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.840]   from case to case, but his job is not to medicate symptoms, it's to treat the
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:25.680]   disease. So that the preacher should not be over-interested in the particular form
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:31.640]   that the sin takes. Indeed I'm very concerned about this, it becomes a very
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.880]   important point not only in preaching but also when you give personal counseling
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.560]   and interviews to people at the end of your service. Some of these people will
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.320]   come in and talk to you and you will find almost invariably that they'll want
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.820]   to talk about their particular sin. They've got hold of the notion some of
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.400]   that if they got rid of this one thing all would be right. That's the thing that
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.040]   you and I have to correct. We have to show them that though they get rid of
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   that particular sin, they're still in as great a need as they were before. And
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.240]   that the business of salvation is not merely to get rid of particular problems,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:12.520]   it is to put the whole man right in his relationship to God. So the preacher, he
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:20.440]   doesn't need to know this specialized detailed facts about his people because
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.520]   he knows that there is this general, this common need. And it is a part of his
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:31.240]   preaching to reduce them to that common denominator. He's got to show your
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.080]   self-satisfied Pharisee that his need is terribly great, it's as great as that of
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.400]   the public and if not greater. He's got to show your great intellectualist who
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.640]   bursts of his knowledge and his understanding that he's guilty of a
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.680]   terrible form of intellectual pride which is one of the greatest sins of all.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:53.840]   Much worse than many sins of the flesh. This pride of men trusting to himself
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.640]   and his learning and his knowledge. The man who comes to listen as an inspector
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.920]   instead of listening as a sinner. He's got to be convicted, he's got to be
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:08.800]   reduced. So you see the preacher is in this position that he doesn't need to go
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   into these different sections. He knows the problem of the factory worker, he
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.600]   knows the problem of the professional men. It's exactly the same. One may get
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.040]   drunk on beer and the other on wine. The point is they both get drunk and so on
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:29.720]   with the various other manifestations. So I say suggest to you that this approach
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.200]   is based on entirely wrong thinking. Indeed it comes in the end to bad
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:41.240]   theology and it's a failure to realize the true nature of sin and that this is
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:47.080]   the problem and that this specialization on the particular forms and
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.920]   manifestations is irrelevant and is very largely a waste of time. The great
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.040]   history of the church and of preaching throughout the centuries, as I've
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:02.640]   already reminded you, substantiates this argument. This general preaching is
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.480]   applied in particular by the Holy Spirit to the particular cases and they're
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.320]   brought to see their same common fundamental need and they are converted
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.920]   and they're regenerated in the same way by the same spirit and so they mix
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.600]   together in the same church and if they can't, well then they're not regenerated.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.000]   It just comes to that. If they feel that they've been neglected perhaps because
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.840]   of their great intellects or something, it shows that there is a fundamental
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.160]   lack of humility. They haven't been humble as they should have been. The
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.240]   glory of the church is that she consists of all these types and kinds and all
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:48.280]   these varieties and variations and yet because they're sharing this common life
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:54.480]   they're able to participate together and enjoy the same preaching. Well there is
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.080]   the case in general but I can imagine someone putting a question at this point
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:06.120]   and saying but what about 1 Corinthians 9 verses 19 to 23? Let me read them to
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:12.000]   you. Paul describing his own ministry says "for though I be free from all men
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.200]   yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain them all and unto the
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.240]   as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.840]   without law as without law being not without law to God but under the law to
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.960]   Christ that I might gain them that are without law to the weak became I as weak
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.080]   that I might gain the weak. I made all things to all men that I might by all
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.600]   means save some and this I do for the gospel's sake that I might be partaker
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:59.880]   thereof with you." Now this I think is an important passage because looked at
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:05.000]   superficially it might seem to be the justification of much of this argumentation
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.440]   today which suggests that the pew should rarely be controlling the
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.400]   pulpit. The Apostle on the surface seems to be saying that what he does is
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.600]   determined by the people to whom he is speaking. Well now how do we deal with
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.960]   this? Well there can be no doubt that in the main the Apostle here was dealing
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.360]   with his conduct and his behavior rather than his actual preaching but I do
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   believe that at the same time he was also dealing with the method or the way
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:46.080]   in which he presented his truth and we can surely come to certain conclusions.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.960]   This Apostle of all Apostles but it was true of all the others also obviously
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:58.720]   does not mean that the content of the message there is with the people. He is
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:04.360]   only concerned here with the form of presentation. I think we'll all agree
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.720]   about that but now when we come to this matter of presentation which is the
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.760]   thing that we're dealing with what is the teaching? Well it's obvious that there
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:21.840]   is clear teaching here to this effect that we must be flexible as preachers. We
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:28.540]   mustn't be traditionalists. We mustn't be legalists in this matter. Now there's a
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:34.640]   grave danger to many of us to become traditionalists and legalists. There are
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.040]   some people who seem to delight in using archaic phrases and if you don't use
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.040]   them they doubt whether you're preaching the gospel at all. They're slaves to
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:51.080]   phrases. I've known certain young men who developed a new interest for instance
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:56.040]   in the Puritans who start speaking as if they lived in the 17th century and the
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.140]   thing is quite ludicrous. They use phrases that were current and common
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:09.080]   then and they even tried to affect a kind of stance and appearance which I
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.680]   imagine was characteristic of the Puritans but which is no longer
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:19.240]   characteristic of Christian people and they affect mannerisms. Now surely all
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:27.360]   this is entirely wrong. We should not be interested in the incidentals or the
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.640]   temporary or the passing things. We should be interested in the principles
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.080]   and the things that are permanent and that is what the apostle of course is
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.960]   saying. He had to fight a great fight over this whole matter as you know. He's
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.680]   been dealing with the question of meats offered to idols in the previous chapter.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:51.080]   He has to deal with it again in writing to the Romans in chapter 14. People were
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:58.000]   tied by traditions belonging to their unconverted existence and they were in
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.360]   genuine trouble about this. The Jews were in trouble, so were some of the Gentiles.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   Over these meats offered to Gentiles and so on. You remember the argumentation.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.760]   Now what the apostle is always saying is this, that while you hold on to the
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.480]   essentials you must be elastic with regard to things that are not essential.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.920]   Because he has to qualify this. He's concerned about the weaker brother. You
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:28.400]   don't trample on him. You try to help him and you even cease from doing things
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.560]   that are legitimate to you if they're an offense to your brother. Wherefore he
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.000]   says if meat make my brother to offend I will eat no flesh while the world
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.120]   standeth lest I make my brother to offend. Conscience not thine own but the
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.360]   other also and so on. But this is the thing that he is saying and saying very
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   plainly and clearly. That you mustn't allow prejudices to stand between people
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:59.840]   and your message. You mustn't allow your own personal fibles. You must be doing
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:05.320]   your utmost to help these people to whom you are preaching to come to a knowledge
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:15.200]   of the truth. So you don't when you're preaching to the Gentiles, you don't go
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.920]   and insist upon certain things which certain Jewish Christians are still
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:25.880]   insisting upon. They're insisting upon them wrongly. But there it is they are.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.640]   You mustn't do that. Now you remember Paul had to withstand Peter to the face
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.400]   at Antioch over this very matter. Peter had got into a muddle over all this and
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.880]   Paul had to correct him publicly. He tells you that in Galatians 2. That's the
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:43.200]   sort of thing with which is dealing here. I sum it up in modern terms by putting it
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:50.040]   like this. That it is always our business to be contemporary. Our object is to deal
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:54.920]   with the living people who are in front of us. I mustn't go into the pulpit with
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.240]   some wonderful picture which I may have and which to me is ideal of the Puritan
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:05.200]   preacher of 300 years ago and act as if I were that to these people who are in
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.000]   front of me. I'm doing harm if I do that. It would be an offense to them. It
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.640]   would be difficult. It's not essential to my message at all. I can learn from them
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.520]   but I mustn't be a slavish imitator of them. I am helped by their knowledge of the
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.560]   truth and their expositions but the things that were merely incidental, the
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   things that were passing and temporary. I mustn't hold on to those and make these
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:37.360]   almost as essential as the truth itself. You are familiar with the kind of thing
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.880]   I'm saying. Well now this is the argument surely of the Apostle. That we must have
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:52.040]   this elasticity in our actual mode of presentation. But let's be clear even here
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:58.800]   that there are certain limits even to this principle which we are granting. We
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.920]   mustn't be archaic and egoistic but there are limits. And one limit obviously
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:09.320]   is that the end does not justify the means. This is a very common argument
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.160]   today. They say but people are converted as the result of this. The end justifies
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.680]   the means. We don't accept that Jesuistical argument and we have good
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.000]   reasons for not doing so. The end does not determine the means nor justify
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.680]   them. Secondly our methods must always be consistent and compatible with our
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:40.480]   message and not contradict the message. Here I feel is the most important point
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:47.160]   at this present time. There are men who are quite sincere and genuine and honest
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.520]   and their motive is very good. Their concern is to bring people to salvation.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:45:00.320]   But this so runs away with them. That in their idea of being familiar and making
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.200]   it easy for the people. They do things which I suggest contradict their own
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:11.240]   message. Now the moment your method contradicts your message it has become
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:17.140]   bad. Less of elasticity but never to the point of contradicting your message.
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.880]   Now this is not only right of course in terms of biblical principles but it's
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:27.320]   even right in practice. And what always amazes me about these people who are so
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.760]   concerned about modern methods is their terrible psychological ignorance. They
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:39.720]   don't seem to know human nature. You know the world expects us to be different. And
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   this idea that you're going to win the world by showing that you are very
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.400]   similar to it. There's scarcely any difference at all but a very slight one.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:52.240]   It's basically wrong not only theologically but even psychologically.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:58.000]   Now I can put this in the terms again of a very well-known example of this thing.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.320]   At the end of the First World War in Britain there was a man who was very
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.360]   famous in religious circles and he was known as Woodbine Willie. I don't know
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.120]   whether any of you ever read of him. He's been dead a number of years. Why was he
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.960]   called Woodbine Willie? Well here was the answer. He was a chaplain in the army in
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   the First World War. And he was a great success as a chaplain. And apparently his
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.000]   success he thought and many thought with him was due to this. That he mixed with
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.760]   the men in a familiar manner. And he smoked with them and he not only smoked
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.560]   with them but he smoked their brand of cigarette. Now hence the name Woodbine.
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:48.800]   In England in those days, they may be still there for all I know, but they were
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.280]   certainly there then, there was a very cheap kind of cigarette which was known
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.360]   as Wild Woodbine. You were able to buy five of them for a penny before the
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:02.000]   First World War. To my shame I did so many times. Now this was a very cheap
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.880]   type of cigarette. Not the sort of cigarette that an officer would smoke
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:12.480]   but the ordinary soldier. He smoked Wild Woodbines. So this man in order to get
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   them to be at ease, in order that he could evangelize them, he smoked Woodbines.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.840]   Woodbine Willie. Well then you see he not only did that but he noticed that most
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.120]   of these men couldn't talk without swearing. So he would swear. He didn't
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.200]   want to swear. But of course if you want to win them you've got to use their
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   language and you've got to be like them. So he would swear and use expressions and
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.000]   language which he thought would go down well. Well up to a point this seems to, it
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.120]   certainly made him a popular figure. There's no doubt about that. But then you
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:47.960]   see he came back at the end of the war and he used to go around the country
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.960]   teaching this. All preachers must do this. And many tried to do it and began to do
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:48:00.480]   it. But the verdict of history on this was that it was a complete failure.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:08.440]   Complete failure. And so it's something that disappeared entirely from the
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.600]   thinking of the church. But it had a great work. This was the way to do it. You
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.400]   see the fallacy? Our Lord attracted sinners because he was different. They
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:27.040]   drew near to him. They felt something about him. The poor woman in her sin. She
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.000]   didn't draw nigh to the Pharisees and wash their feet with her tears and wipe
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:37.160]   them with the hairs of her head. No, no. She sensed something in him. This purity,
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:44.080]   this holiness, this love. And so she drew near to him. It was his difference that
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:49.480]   attracted. And the world expects us to be different. And this notion that you're
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.840]   going to win people by showing them how similar you are to them is
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.440]   theologically and psychologically a real blunder. And of course this is even
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.720]   happening in another sphere at the present time. There are foolish
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.640]   Protestants who seem to think that the way to win Roman Catholics is to show
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.680]   that there's practically no difference between us. Whereas the converted Roman
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.240]   Catholic will always tell you that what appealed to him was that we were so
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.720]   entirely different. It's wrong psychologically as well as
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:24.560]   theologically. And so I go on to point out that this must be wrong for the
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:29.360]   reason that the subject matter with which we're dealing with is so different. We
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:35.600]   are dealing with God and the knowledge of God and our relationship to God. So
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:41.560]   because the service is under God, it's got to be with reverence and godly fear.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:48.080]   We don't decide this. We are not in charge and control. It is God. It's his
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:54.800]   service and he has to be approached with reverence and with godly fear.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:00.520]   Furthermore, light entertainment, easy familiarity, jocularity is not
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.560]   compatible with the seriousness of the condition of the soul and its lost
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:13.440]   estate and its need of salvation. And not only that, such methods cannot bring out
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:20.880]   the truth. And our business is to preach the truth. These methods may
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:25.800]   affect people. They may lead to decisions. But our object is not merely to get
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:32.440]   decisions. It is to bring people to a knowledge of the truth. And beyond this,
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.560]   we must never give the impression that all that is needed is for people to make
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:42.960]   a little adjustment in their thinking and ideas and terminology. That is the
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:48.920]   militant against our message. Our message is that every man needs to be born again.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.640]   And that whatever may happen to him short of that is of no value whatsoever
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:51:00.280]   from this standpoint. The young believer is all wrong. It isn't merely his ideas
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:06.360]   of modern art or of drama that's wrong. Everything about him is wrong. And his
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:11.680]   particular views are wrong because his whole view is wrong. The rule is "Seek ye
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.960]   first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these other things
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:21.280]   shall be added unto you." But if you put all your emphasis on these other things
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:26.320]   instead of on seeking first the kingdom of God, well you're doomed to failure.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:32.640]   And you are doing despite to the message that has been committed to you. No one
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.840]   has ever been reasoned into the kingdom of God. It is impossible. It's never
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:44.320]   happened. It never will happen. We are all one. The whole world lieth guilty
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:50.040]   before God. We are in the same condition. And so I argue that all that passage in
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:59.080]   1 Corinthians 9 teaches is that we are to do our utmost to make ourselves clear
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:06.040]   and plain and understood. We are never to allow our own prejudices or foibles or
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.400]   things that are incidental to the message to be a hindrance to the message.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:17.880]   We are to be all things to all men in that sense and in that sense only. So I
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.720]   end by saying that the real trouble with this outlook is that it forgets the Holy
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:32.400]   Spirit and His power. We've become such experts as we think in psychological
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:37.160]   understanding, dividing people up into groups and nationalities and saying
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.320]   that's all right for one nationality and not for another. You know you deny the
[00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:46.040]   gospel when you say a thing like that. There is neither Jew nor Gentile,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.480]   barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. And if you think you can explain a thing
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   away in terms of nationality you are denying the gospel. This is the one
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:02.520]   gospel, the only gospel. It's for the whole world and the whole of humanity.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:09.400]   And mankind is one and we have fallen into the grievous error of adopting
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:14.440]   modern psychological ideas and in the end we use that to evade the truth,
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:20.760]   sometimes to protect ourselves from the message and certainly often to justify
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:27.440]   message methods that are not consistent and consonant with the message which we
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   are privileged to deliver. Very well, I leave it at that for this afternoon and
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.240]   will complete it, God willing, tomorrow afternoon.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.320]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
