[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Welcome back. On Monday we looked at whether or not life has morally neutral areas, those
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.560]   gray areas, areas in life where we make decisions that are not necessarily sinful or holy. And
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960]   in that first episode of the week, ABJ 1846, Pastor John defines sin for us. He defines
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.500]   sin with Romans 3.23, saying, "Sin is first the disposition of the human heart to prefer
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.080]   human glory, especially self-glory, over God's glory." We exchange God's glory for something
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:47.200]   we prefer more. We sin by exchanging the glory of God with another glory. That's verse 23.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.880]   Then verse 24 gives the solution to the sin that we must be "justified by His grace as
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:02.040]   a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." That's Romans 3.24. This pair of glorious
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.520]   verses, Romans 3.23, Romans 3.24, one verse defining sin, the other defining God's response
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.340]   to that sin, holds the key to how we become unshakable people in this world. Those verses
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.900]   are, according to Pastor John, more important than 10,000 books written by man to help you
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.040]   solve your problems. So much so, Pastor John says, if you build your life on these two
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.820]   verses, make them the foundation of your life, you will be strong and stable in a hundred
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.680]   crises of life. That's the bold testimony of John Piper, who makes those very claims
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.260]   in today's sermon clip, a clip from a 1999 sermon. Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:56.040]   Verse 23 describes the universal need of every human being, and verse 24 gives the all-sufficient
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.380]   remedy for that need. These two verses are more important than 10,000 books written by
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.420]   man about how to solve your problems and make your future better. These are the words of
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.700]   God through the Apostle Paul, and they tell us about our true condition, and they tell
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.940]   us about what God has done to remedy that condition. If you will build your life on
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.140]   these two verses, if you will make them the foundation of your life, you will be strong
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.020]   and stable in a hundred crises. If you will put these verses and the truth of them at
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.300]   the center of your life, like the sun at the center of the planets of the solar system
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:58.860]   of your life, then this truth will hold the orbiting planets of all the concerns and aspects
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:09.440]   of your life in place. But if you allow this truth of Romans 3, 23 and 24 to begin to marginalize
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.920]   and slip out to the rim, say where Neptune and Pluto are out there, you know what would
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.860]   happen if the sun moved from the center to the periphery of the solar system. Everything
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.540]   would be destroyed. Everything would be in chaos. Everything would be confusion and perplexity
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.620]   and weakness, which is why so many professing Christians coast and amble through life, wondering
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.860]   why their lives are so strangely perplexed, so out of sync and out of kilter and out of
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:55.140]   order and nothing seems to be working right. It's because the truth of this magnificent
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.980]   gospel that I'm going to try to articulate is not at the center anymore. It's not the
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.820]   sun that's holding everything in place. It doesn't have the weight of gravity to pull
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:17.940]   all things. Something else is at the center. You should be asking yourself right now, what's
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:27.660]   that in my life? Something really grips me in my life. Something I come back to again
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.060]   and again and again. I go there in the morning and I go there at noon and I go there at night
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:49.580]   and it pulls on me. What is it? Verse 23 says that the universal need in the world of every
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:04.340]   person has to do with sin. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. No exceptions.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.500]   There's no distinction. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. We saw that
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.180]   from verse 18 of chapter 1 to verse 20 of chapter 3. And now he tells us a little something
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.020]   about this condition by saying, if you've sinned, your present condition is that you
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:35.940]   are now falling short of the glory of God. Literally, the word is, you are now lacking
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:47.180]   the glory of God. What does that mean? All have sinned and are lacking the glory of God.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.340]   Does that mean that we were supposed to be as glorious as God and we fell short and didn't
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:03.820]   arrive at that divine glory and so we have fallen short? I don't think that's what it
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.220]   means. You were designed to be as glorious as God. The best way to put meat on the bones
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:16.660]   of this simple verse is to go back to Romans 1 and look at the discussion of glory in the
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:26.220]   context of sin and see what a lacking might mean in Romans. So if you notice in Romans
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:35.580]   1 verse 18, Paul said, they are suppressing the truth in unrighteousness. Everybody in
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:43.260]   the world is a truth suppressor until God gets a hold of us. We suppress the truth in
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:52.380]   our sin, in our unrighteousness. And then look at verse 23. They exchanged the glory
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:07:04.380]   of God, of the incorruptible God, for an image. In verse 28, they disapproved of having God
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:12.540]   in their knowledge. That's a literal translation. They disapproved of having God in their knowledge.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:22.340]   So the picture you get is that sin is a failure to embrace the glory of God and God Himself
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:31.940]   as our highest treasure and make Him the center and foundation and supreme value of our lives.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:43.100]   And thus to exchange that glory for some other treasure in this world and thus lack that
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:52.940]   glory as our treasure and thus bring great dishonor upon God. That's what sin is and
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:08:03.220]   does. Sin is mainly about God. It's not mainly about hurting people. Sin hurts people. Sin
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:09.460]   hurts people. It'll hurt you in the end. But it's not mainly about hurting people. It's
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:23.460]   mainly about God and trading, bartering, throwing away His supreme value and glory in order
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.340]   that we might put something else at the center and in the bank and in the treasury of our
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:38.460]   lives that we love and we lean on and we find satisfaction in. And thus He is belittled
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:48.020]   and despised, sometimes wittingly and sometimes unwittingly, with the same effect in both
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:56.420]   cases. Now that's a great guilt. That's a great guilt. The reason it's a great guilt
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:05.180]   is because God created this universe, the whole universe, to display His glory so that
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:16.420]   we might see it and value it and love it and enjoy it and reflect it in the world. That's
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:25.580]   why the universe and you were created. It should not, therefore, be surprising to us
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:36.580]   that the world will go haywire when the world is in rebellion against the design of the
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:46.900]   world. If God designed the world, according to Isaiah 43, 7, to display His glory and
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:54.260]   you are choosing to dispense with His glory, to put something else at the center of your
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:00.380]   life and love it and live for it and think about it and dwell on it and value it, it's
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.980]   not surprising that the design of God for a beautiful, holistic world would be destroyed
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:17.460]   in your life. There is dysfunction and chaos and misery all over the world because the
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:24.740]   whole world is in rebellion against valuing the glory of God above all things. That's
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:37.060]   why the world and your life is in the condition that it's in. Sin is contemplating God as
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:45.540]   the supreme value and rejecting Him as the supreme value and thus exchanging the glory
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:55.540]   of God for some kind of substitute image. Think of what it is. And thus lacking the
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:05.820]   glory and thus dishonoring the glory of God. And that is a great guilt. And that's the
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:15.140]   universal condition of humankind in verse 23. It's a massive problem now that we have.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:21.580]   And the problem is, since we've all done this, how can we get right with God when we
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:31.340]   have so belittled Him? And that's what verse 24 is about. This verse is so rich. A great
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.860]   turn has come in Romans in verse 21, "But now apart from the law, the righteousness
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.740]   of God has been manifested. Some great event has happened now." You hear that word now?
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:51.580]   But now, but now some great event has happened. And something new is happening in the world.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:12:04.140]   No other religion, no other religion knows of this great now. Because it's the now of
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:16.100]   the arrival of Jesus Christ and the redemption that is in Him. So let's read verse 24. "Being
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:28.700]   justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus."
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:35.100]   Glorious truth, profound text, and high reminder. This clip was taken from John Piper's sermon
