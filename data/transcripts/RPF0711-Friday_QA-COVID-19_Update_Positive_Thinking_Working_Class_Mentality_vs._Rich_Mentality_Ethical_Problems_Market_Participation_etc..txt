[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:52.660]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.900]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.420]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.860]   My name is Joshua. I am your host.
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.860]   And today it's Friday. We do live Q&A.
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.100]   Going to begin with a quick update on what I see happening with coronavirus and the economy.
[00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100]   Then I've got one, two, three, four, five, six callers on the line.
[00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.580]   And today we're going to be moving fast.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.380]   I got a busy day, but thank you for being here.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:25.700]   If you are new here to the Radical Personal Finance podcast, every Friday when I can arrange
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.580]   the details and the logistics of being able to record a live Q&A call-in show, I do that.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.660]   Today is Friday, March 27, 2020.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.860]   These shows are open to patrons of the show.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860]   Those who sign up at Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.540]   If you would like to gain access to these call-in shows, go to Patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.860]   It's one of the best ways to do a call-in and be able to talk about anything you want.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.500]   Gives you a chance to ask any question you like.
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260]   We can talk about things in general.
[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.100]   We could talk about anything in your particular life.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.700]   You can make any comment you'd like to make.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100]   Basically, if you want to chat with me, this is one of the best ways to do it.
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.420]   One of the cheapest ways to do it as well.
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.540]   So for all you deal hounds out there, this is one of your best ways to do it.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.340]   I want to begin with a brief update on what I see happening with coronavirus and what I see
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.500]   happening with the economy.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.340]   Obviously, we live in an interesting and frankly staggering time.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.180]   The headlines over the last few days have been that a third of the world's population is
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.620]   locked down due to coronavirus.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.020]   And that is certainly really amazing to think about the scope of this thing.
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.980]   So it's affecting all of our lives.
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.500]   You've had historic drops in the stock market, some massive increases the last few days.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.580]   You've also had just a massive, as the economic data starts to come out, unemployment in the
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.660]   United States, huge.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.660]   We've got stimulus packages all over the place, all over the world.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.260]   We'll talk about that later time.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.700]   We'll talk about in the United States.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.820]   But check in on that.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.780]   But here is what I see happening right now.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.180]   So right now, as I look at the data on coronavirus, it's unclear to me what is
[00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.700]   happening. What I see happening is an increasing geometric curve, but it doesn't seem to be
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.100]   as severe as was previously expected.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.780]   And so that's good news.
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260]   I'm hopeful. I have a few points of good news.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.340]   And so I'm more optimistic than I was recently.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.940]   And so I think that's hopefully you are as well.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.660]   That although you see a profusion of cases, although things are very difficult in many
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.460]   places in the world, some cities in the United States, it doesn't seem to be as severe as
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.260]   previously feared, which is great news.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.540]   Now, what's currently unclear to me is why it doesn't seem to be as severe as
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.420]   previously feared. And I want to emphasize that it's not that things are not severe.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.100]   There are very heart wrenching things from all over the world.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500]   And I expect more of those those things in the days to come.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500]   If you feel like we're out of the woods, I would caution you.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.580]   I don't I don't sense that at all.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.180]   But it's not as bad as previously thought.
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.620]   Now, again, what's unclear to me is why.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.820]   And I don't think the data is particularly compelling at the moment as far as for sure
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.580]   why. So here's what I see on the viral front going forward.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.060]   And then we'll talk about the economic front.
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.500]   I'm more optimistic this week based upon what I see.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.420]   And as I see it, the worst case scenario was to have this massive global pandemic that
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.620]   was on track to kill tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people.
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.820]   Now, the only absolutely guaranteed solution to that kind of spread is to just simply
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.180]   stay home and go nowhere.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.860]   A virus is something that you can understand how it works, even if it's the most
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.220]   severe, it's transmitted through aerosol, et cetera.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.220]   It's very contagious.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.300]   If you just simply stay home and if you're not infected and you don't go anywhere, then
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.500]   you don't have to be infected.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.380]   And so that's why the ultimate the only like truly guaranteed effective public policy
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.980]   solution is to lock everything down.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.740]   And you see that happening all throughout the world.
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.060]   Now, the lockdown, of course, has devastating economic consequences, as we are all
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.140]   experiencing today.
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.900]   But the lockdown is the only thing that's guaranteed to work.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980]   And that's why governments pursue it.
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.460]   But if you think about kind of what's been the bad scenario, we've assumed that the
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.740]   worst case scenario looking back has been a massive, very contagious, very deadly
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.340]   disease that spreads throughout the world.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.020]   And the answer to that is lockdown until or unless some kind of vaccine is developed in
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.140]   the timeline for that is 12 to 18 months.
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.580]   Now, as we've talked about the jumping off points, as I see it, there are three jumping
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.420]   off points to that worst case scenario.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.100]   And these three are all looking better.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.140]   The first jumping off point is the development of some kind of effective therapy, some
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.580]   some magical cure, some miracle cure.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.060]   The news over last week has especially been hot and heavy around the hydroxy chloroquine
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.020]   and Z-Pak.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.100]   I can't tell you that I'm not a biology guy.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.980]   I see increasing anecdotal evidence that that is possibly effective.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.860]   And there's doctors all over the world that are trying that.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.420]   And I haven't seen it disproven as a therapy.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.060]   So perhaps there's a really good solution there.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.740]   And that would be awesome because those drugs are inexpensive.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.740]   They're widely available.
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.940]   They're kind of old.
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.740]   If they were effective against that, that would be great.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.260]   And I'm sure there are other doctors around the world who are working on other
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.940]   therapies. That's been kind of one of the first things to improve things.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.820]   One of the first areas that we could look at to improve things.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.060]   The second area to look at to improve things would be the development of widespread
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.380]   testing. If a society can develop and implement widespread testing, then the society
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.660]   can just simply quarantine those who are sick.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.980]   And that would be really great.
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.060]   Now, the United States is far behind on this with such a huge population.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.540]   It's hard to see that happening quickly.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.180]   But all around the world, testing is ramping up.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.100]   They're kind of improving things, getting things faster and faster and faster.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.780]   Used to be it was going to be days to get a result for a test.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.180]   Now there are tests that are increasingly widely available and we're up to a day.
[00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.740]   So that's good. Once we can get tests down to a few hours and cheap and distributed
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.700]   all around the world, then that means that societies can do widespread testing and
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.380]   you can just quarantine the sick and those that have had contact with the sick.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.980]   And you see that happening very effectively in some countries in Asia that it seemed
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.940]   to have managed the outbreak more effectively.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.060]   So we're making progress on that front.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.740]   That could be good.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.020]   The most important progress, in my opinion, is the recent development of an antibody
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.820]   test. And if this antibody test proves to be effective and if it can be spread and
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:23.300]   used widely across a population, that I think has the potential of shortening this
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.980]   whole event, shortening this whole affair, which would be awesome.
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.420]   Because of the antibody, what the antibody test could prove is who has had the
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.500]   disease and who has not.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.740]   That can be helpful for a few reasons.
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.740]   Well, one obvious reason is if those who've had the disease actually find
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.940]   themselves to be immune to the disease, they can go back to work without much fear.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.940]   They can be useful in many situations without the worry of getting infected and
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.700]   possibly even spreading the infection.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.180]   But more importantly, as I see it, the antibody test could tell us the actual
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.140]   prevalence of the disease in a population so that we could better understand the
[00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.900]   people who have severe symptoms.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.900]   The guess and the debate about this particular strain of disease has been how
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.860]   long has it been here?
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.100]   Now, the timeline that most of us understand is that it developed in Wuhan.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.540]   It started in China.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.700]   It started to be spread from there.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.340]   Wuhan got really serious in December and then it got bad in January and then it
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.580]   started to spread throughout the world.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.660]   And then it spread throughout the world and we've got some cases.
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.700]   But along the way, there've been a lot of anecdotal reports of people saying, well,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.020]   I had something, I thought it was just a severe flu, but I had something like that
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.580]   back in December or I had something like that back in January.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.260]   And so one of the suspicions is that the disease is actually much more widespread
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:44.860]   than previously thought and that it's just simply less catastrophic with its
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.740]   medical impact than previously thought.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.300]   But the only way to know that for certain is to develop and then implement a
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.220]   widespread antibody testing.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.580]   And so that's the development that I'm excited about and looking to see what
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.820]   happens over the next week or two.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.300]   Because if it did prove, if we could prove that there were actually a lot of
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.460]   people tested, then, sorry, a lot of people with the disease and just a smaller
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.300]   number than previously feared are actually sick all the time, that would be
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.180]   fantastic because then that would allow society to open up a little bit.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.740]   So there's the optimistic case, at least that I'm hoping for.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.620]   At the moment, it's unclear to me personally what's actually happening.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.060]   I'm confused by the reports I read.
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.140]   I'm confused by the data that I see, and I'm just simply not competent to assess
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:33.620]   it, and so I'm waiting and watching and letting the epidemiologists do their thing.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.140]   Note of important news is that some of the most dire predictions have been rolled
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.820]   back significantly in the last week, and so that's great news.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.140]   Now let's flip this now and talk about the economic impact because here's
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.100]   what I've thought a lot about.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.420]   Obviously, we're hurting massively.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.420]   I've spoken to so many listeners and clients who are just going through
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.860]   catastrophic change.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.500]   The unemployment claims huge all around the world.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.820]   Businesses just, you know, kind of waiting to see.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.820]   We're all waiting to see.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:11.060]   So we're all desperate for a better understanding of what the actual data is
[00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.660]   telling us.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.460]   On the worst case scenario, we've got catastrophe, right?
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.180]   Total catastrophe.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:17.700]   We know that.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.780]   But on the best case scenario, I've thought, well, does this all just go back
[00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.300]   to normal?
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.300]   Obviously, that's what we would all hope for.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.660]   And it's interesting thing about something like a flu pandemic is that maybe
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.660]   maybe the whole thing is exposed a few weeks from now.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.300]   It's just a total overreaction.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   It was a giant scare, but we got it wrong.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   And so can everything just go back to normal?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.260]   That's one of the interesting things about a flu pandemic, because if you had a job
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.180]   and there was a functioning business a couple of weeks ago, let's say that a few
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:50.140]   weeks from now we find out that our worst fears were unfounded
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.380]   and we can all go back to work.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.820]   Well, all the infrastructure still exists.
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.660]   Everything still exists.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.380]   So maybe we should just go ahead and get back to work.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.340]   I think it's possible that could happen to some degree, and that would help to
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.260]   avoid some of the worst case scenarios.
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:09.700]   You know, 50% unemployment kind of thing, 50% drop in GDP, which is it's hard to
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.620]   even say those numbers.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.900]   But I still can't see an immediate return.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.020]   And that's one of the desperately difficult things about a flu pandemic.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.260]   My life, because of my lifestyle, doesn't look that different today than it did a
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.460]   few weeks ago and then it did a few months ago.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.940]   And I wouldn't expect it to look that different a few months from now.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.780]   But I am so tired of this thing.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.900]   It feels like it just goes on and on and on.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.780]   I've been paying attention to it since January.
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.660]   Here we are in March.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.820]   And so a flu pandemic is awful because it's so long.
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:49.860]   It's probably years in terms of before everything is fully understood or fully
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.100]   handled. And so you just get so tired of it.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.660]   And I think that that is being expressed.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.540]   I feel that way.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.780]   And I think I see that same thing being expressed in so many other people where
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.260]   I've been sitting at home for a week.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.980]   I'm done. Let's get on with life here.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.980]   And so we feel that.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.260]   But the problem is that nothing would rapidly go back.
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:18.540]   And so even in a best case scenario, for example, I just was talking with my wife
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.860]   about this morning, I said, let's go through the best case scenario.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.900]   Let's assume that we get widespread antibody testing.
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.860]   Let's assume that it proves that our worst fears were unfounded.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.180]   It's not as deadly as previously thought.
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.180]   Would we go immediately back and just say, let's go to it?
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.380]   I wouldn't. I'm not going to.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.900]   I would continue to stay largely isolated.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.300]   I would add in some activities again, but I wouldn't just go right back to it.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.940]   I wouldn't just go to public places, start going to public gatherings, start going
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.580]   to conventions and things like that, even if it were just the common flu.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.020]   Right. The flu itself is an awful thing.
[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.780]   Most people don't go out to places where they know people have the flu.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.260]   Many people are very cautious and careful, as they should be, to protect
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.220]   themselves against that. So even if we just said, you know what, the people who
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.380]   said it's just the flu were right.
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.620]   I don't think they were right.
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.220]   But maybe they are.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.220]   It's just the flu.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:21.100]   Well, even still, I would adjust my own life and still maintain safety and be
[00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.300]   careful until time goes on.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.100]   And so even if that were the case or even if some kind of vaccine were developed,
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.060]   you know, I was talking to my wife about that.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.740]   Would we take some kind of vaccine?
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.940]   I wouldn't. Not in the short term, at least.
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:40.260]   Now, just because I don't trust things that are rushed to market, I don't trust
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.140]   the way that this kind of emergency footing, you get bad data, you get bad
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.980]   testing. There's such a press to like get the economy going that I would just, I
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.060]   know that I'm safe if I stay home and I minimize my contact.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.460]   And so I would continue that for a period of time.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.020]   Now, I don't think that most people are like me.
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.780]   I think most people would just say, let's get back to it.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.060]   But I think there's enough people like me that would keep things constrained that
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.580]   I still expect, even in the best flu case now, I still expect significant economic
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:14.140]   recession, possibly depression just simply due to the change in behavior.
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:20.860]   So I say that to say I'm cautiously optimistic today about the virus.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.620]   I still don't think that there's a reason to think that we're all just going to
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.980]   get back to normal in a few weeks, even in the best case scenarios.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.140]   And I still think that some of the really difficult scenarios are possible.
[00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.940]   And so I'm just waiting and seeing.
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.460]   I don't know what any of us can do except wait and see, do the best we can in our
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.620]   personal finances, do the best we can to care for our families and kind of watch
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.380]   for more evidence to develop.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.940]   I think the last week was really important and the next couple of weeks will be
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.380]   really important because if the worst case scenarios don't very quickly start to
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.820]   be seen, then I think we can look and say that, you know what, it wasn't as bad as
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.340]   we feared.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.660]   Now, that doesn't bode well for the future.
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.900]   Anytime you make big warnings about people, people generally don't want to
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.500]   overreact.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.940]   There's a big political argument about we're overreacting and this was crazy,
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.460]   et cetera.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:14.580]   I see it as I see overreaction in the early stage of a flu outbreak is the only
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.580]   rational response.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.500]   It's the only rational response until you get more data.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.740]   And unfortunately, though, that doesn't work well in today's soundbite world.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.940]   And so I'm hoping for the best, but still kind of watching day by day and see what
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.380]   happens.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.580]   So that's my update for you.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:34.860]   Last week on the Q&A show, I talked significantly about the need for, or I
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.700]   talked about the value of being concerned about financial stability in the banks,
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.500]   et cetera.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.940]   I encouraged you to withdraw an appropriate amount of physical currency from the
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.260]   bank.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.460]   I still stand by that recommendation.
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.900]   I have not seen any evidence this last week of any widespread panic, which I'm
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.820]   thrilled about.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.100]   I have continued to get reports from listeners that they have a hard time
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.260]   getting much money out of the bank.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.580]   I think if you've never tried to do business in cash, you have no concept of
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.140]   how hard it is.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.980]   If you've never tried to do a wire transfer, you have no concept of how the
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:08.540]   bank treats you like a crook until you have to prove to them 10 ways otherwise.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.020]   It's not your money in that situation.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.900]   It's insane.
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:18.420]   And so I'm still concerned about that, but thankfully I've seen no major risk
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.060]   factors emerge over the next week, and I'm hoping that we don't get any more risk
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.980]   factors over the coming weeks.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.100]   But I still am concerned about the potential of those risk factors.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.020]   On Monday morning, the FDIC released a video saying you don't need to get money
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.500]   out of the bank.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.300]   You can trust an FDIC insured account.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.820]   That tells me that a lot of people are concerned and taking money out of the
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.100]   bank.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.900]   And so the key thing I would just encourage you to remember is that the
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.460]   hardest thing about a flu pandemic is you're going to get tired of it.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.860]   I'm tired of it.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.340]   I'm tired of talking about it on the show.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.180]   I'm tired of it.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.260]   We're all tired of it.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.460]   But this kind of disaster is very slow moving.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.420]   There's not a quick answer to it.
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.500]   It's very slow moving.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.740]   And these risks continue.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.220]   So I would not rush down to the bank and deposit all my money and say, "Hey,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.500]   look, we're getting into it."
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.060]   That's woefully premature.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.380]   I'm still concerned about longer term events.
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.980]   On Monday night, I did a special presentation with students of my How to
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:17.020]   Survive and Thrive During the Coming Economic Crisis course, and we talked
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.940]   about protecting your money from worst case scenarios like hyperinflation.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.140]   I don't predict hyperinflation in the United States.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.620]   I still think the U.S.
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.620]   dollar, as evidenced by the data, is the strongest currency in the world.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.660]   But I'm watching the numbers every single day, watching very carefully.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:41.260]   We are in historic times, and the actual impact of those events is not apparent.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.820]   But I've taken steps to protect my savings from those events.
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:49.460]   So that's my summary statement of where we stand as of Friday, March 27, 2020.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.700]   I hope that's helpful to you.
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.340]   And now let's go to the phones and answer some questions.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.260]   We begin with Anne in Maryland.
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:56.980]   Anne, welcome to the show.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.820]   How can I serve you today?
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:01.300]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.100]   Thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.660]   I have a reflection that I would like to share, not necessarily a question, and I
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.660]   obviously would be very interested in your response.
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:21.140]   But before I tell you about the reflection and my observations, I just want to caveat
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:28.340]   it by saying that I work in drug development business, and I do understand where to read
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.420]   the right information and what's bullshit and what's not.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:31.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.100]   You probably have forgot this.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:39.260]   So, first of all, I have to apologize.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.740]   I haven't listened to all of your releases recently.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.900]   And this has to do with my first observation of information fatigue.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.780]   I realized that at some point there's so much information coming in, even for a person
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:58.460]   like me who can sort through the information, get the right one.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:06.620]   And I observed that when I stopped, really, I just took basic care of my family, of
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:12.300]   myself. I decided what I need to do every day and how I need to live every day.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.540]   And I stopped consuming the information.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.660]   The days are wonderful.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.380]   The weather is wonderful.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.380]   And it's just the life is wonderful.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:28.820]   So the second thing that I noticed is that I noticed that there is a huge, there is
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.100]   value in morale.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:35.260]   So there is so much fear about what the virus would do to us and the economics and
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:40.380]   everything. And I think that there is a huge value in morale.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:48.020]   And that is like we are trying to pay enormous price for something we don't know the
[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:55.540]   price of, which is the virus and pandemic, by sacrificing something that also has huge
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.980]   value. And so I decided that morale of myself and my family is very important.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.260]   And I took steps to boost that.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:10.580]   And then by also helping people around, offering them to bring them groceries to their
[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.660]   porches and all other things, sharing what I have.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:20.820]   The other day I was in the store and I was getting some of the food and the cashier asked
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:27.500]   me if I could, if it's OK, if instead of six cans, I only take three cans of something.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.780]   And I said, oh, of course, do you want all of them?
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.620]   And she was so surprised because everyone else was fighting for their cans.
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.460]   And I said, no, no, no. If you really need those cans, you can keep them.
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.340]   And she just, she almost cried and said, thank you very much.
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.420]   People usually don't give back those cans.
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.020]   I said, are you kidding me?
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:54.140]   This is. And so it takes me to the next point is that this is probably the biggest event
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.380]   that I experienced since the collapse of Soviet Union, which I personally experienced
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:05.580]   for myself. And I know and when I was a child during the collapse of Soviet Union, so I
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.500]   had a little bit different impression of that.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.580]   But I remember very well my grandparents and my parents, what it did to them.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:21.740]   And right now, as an adult, I was surprised that I have no fear that, you know, that the
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.540]   market is falling or anything.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.620]   I have a feeling of wanting to help.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:36.620]   So the only way I can keep my kind of my sanity, my dignity, my morale, my sorry, my
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:42.220]   voice breaks up, but is by is by giving back.
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:48.340]   So if I'm hearing the tests are missing, right, I try to contact all my friends, doctors
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.660]   and ask what's missing, why tests are not there.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.340]   Is it because there are no reagents?
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.820]   Is it because there are not enough PCR machines?
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.900]   Can we get together?
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   There are so many researchers who can donate.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.940]   I contacted a local health health authorities.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.540]   I know they're doing contact tracing of patients.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.740]   And I said, I have experience experience in medical industry.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.780]   Can I can at least volunteer?
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.260]   We could do contact tracing.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.140]   And I really don't.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.580]   And I I'm just telling you what I'm observing.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:24.060]   I'm observing that I'm not worried about the future because I feel like it's it gives me
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.500]   meaning in life if I help to solve it.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   Like my brain goes to the place where we should solve it, not hide, not.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:42.740]   And I think that people are generally very good people and I'm OK to die if it's
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.620]   these people. And I'm sorry.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.940]   OK. All right.
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:55.540]   I just want to say that it's like imagine wars that our grandparents took part in.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.780]   Imagine soldiers.
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.580]   They go, for instance, and die.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.900]   And you ask them how is it possible that they're not afraid?
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:05.940]   And of course, they're afraid.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:12.260]   But I think something kicks in in our system that's bigger than us.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.540]   And this pandemic is such a silly thing compared, let's say, to World War Two or one
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.460]   when people were actually dying and infrastructure was destroyed and so forth.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.580]   And you see your children dying here.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.580]   We're children are at least safe, more or less.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   And so I'm I just I did not expect it.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.540]   It will make me so so.
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.500]   I wanted to share the fact that.
[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:42.580]   That giving back and participating and fixing it actually can give you so much, so
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.380]   much strength and optimism because you feel like your life is full of meaning and
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.620]   cool. Sorry about that.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.540]   Thank you, Josh.
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:58.060]   Amen. Yeah, I think that that's definitely if you study any tragedy, any disaster, it's
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.900]   a time when so many people can step forward and shine and you appreciate people and
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.300]   you appreciate things in a way that you often don't.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.020]   It's neat to see in all over the United States.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:14.500]   It's neat to see in a with a shortage of PPE, protective equipment.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.100]   It's it's neat to see people stepping up and getting out sewing machines and doing
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.340]   those things. I used to talk to my grandparents some about World War Two and try to
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.460]   understand what life was like in World War Two, because I would I would study.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.740]   You read about it in the history books.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.140]   You read about, you know, people planning victory gardens and making up collections
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.220]   and you read about shortages.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.780]   You couldn't get tires for your cars and all this stuff and factories being
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:47.500]   repurposed. And as I grew up, it was just a sense of unified common purpose that I
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.220]   could not imagine.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.860]   It was just a sense that I could not imagine.
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.940]   And I would talk to them about it.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.740]   And I have often wondered, could that ever come back?
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.740]   You know, you look at the United States and so many countries around the world, you
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.180]   look at the United States and it just seems so entirely fractured.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.100]   And you wonder, can things come back?
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.540]   And on a national level, I don't think so.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.700]   But in your local community, when you recognize that your neighbors are on the left
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.220]   and the right of you and you go down to your local hospital or you look in the local
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:22.860]   community, then you can still have that sense of let's work together and let's beat
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.420]   this thing. And it's exciting to see that experience.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.100]   I know many people reflect on events like 9/11 and they appreciate that sense of
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.740]   camaraderie, that sense of unity that was hard to find in previous times.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.260]   And so I agree.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.540]   I think it's great to have that.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:46.460]   And to your overall point about ignoring the information and not watching the news,
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.380]   it was fascinating. The World Health Organization came out with an official advisory
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.860]   last couple of days. Don't watch the news or you'll feel it'll be something like
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.580]   that. Don't watch the news. It'll depress you.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.420]   And I think that's generally good advice.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:04.780]   I try to pay attention to it because I feel like a responsibility to filter it and
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.380]   to share with others. But at the end of the day, the only reason you really need
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.660]   information is to affect your behavior.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.500]   And so you need enough information to affect your behavior and then go from there.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.060]   And in a time like this, you don't need all that much.
[00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.300]   And there is a real beauty to day to day life.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.380]   There is a beauty to playing with your children.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.500]   There is a beauty to taking a walk outside.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.060]   And I see a lot of people enjoying those things.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:33.380]   And so may we all do that and engage with that more and more.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.580]   So thank you for contributing, Anne.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.100]   Did you have a question or any other comments before I go on to the next caller, Anne?
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.260]   No, just thought I'll share it and maybe someone out there who is listening or
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.300]   participating in the call feel the same way.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.700]   And I hope that they know that there are many people like us.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.660]   Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.220]   And I do thank you for sharing that.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:27:00.140]   And I've thought I've hoped that I did an okay job talking about,
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:05.620]   you know, talking about things without getting too, you know, too
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.420]   depressed. I felt bad last week going away from the show, but I do feel like
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.380]   there's a sense of realism that is important.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:17.260]   But in the midst of realism, it's important to maintain an optimistic attitude.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:21.220]   And I'll do my best in the future to do that, to be realistic,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:25.260]   but also optimistic at the same time. We go now to Indiana. Welcome to the show.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.100]   How can I serve you today?
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.860]   Hi, Joshua. Thanks for taking my call quickly. Anne, thank you for that call.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.820]   I appreciate it. If no one but me and Joshua, at least there's two of us.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   But Joshua, my question was about, I called in last week and
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.820]   was kind of on the wrong topic. It was COVID day.
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.260]   But I feel like I have what for lack of a better term,
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.420]   I would call a working class mentality. Grew up with, you know,
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.420]   most of my family and relatives have been hourly workers of one sort
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.180]   or another, or very low level managers,
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.340]   not a lot of professionals, doctors, lawyers, et cetera.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.660]   And I feel like there is something that I am maybe missing in that,
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.140]   in my mentality, as opposed to
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.660]   having a mentality where I've been more exposed to that.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.540]   So just curious of your thoughts on that and how to, how to change that.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.660]   Yeah. So I thought about this last week and I thank you for calling back.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.460]   It is nice to get away from COVID and talk about something else.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:29.660]   So first I don't have a perfect answer because this is a change that I've,
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.860]   I've had to make myself. And I'll tell you just a short story.
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.980]   When I was a financial advisor, I, I started when I was 23 years old.
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:42.660]   I didn't come from a wealthy family. We were middle-class.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.060]   We were culturally upper middle-class, but financially middle-class.
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.940]   We had a one income family. My dad was an engineer, but he didn't,
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.180]   he didn't work. He didn't make tons and tons of money.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:58.260]   And we always had our needs met, but we didn't live the high lifestyle that we
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.460]   didn't live a high consumption lifestyle. We, we had, we weren't poor.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.020]   We didn't have cars that were breaking down all the time.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.980]   We didn't worry about,
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.060]   I didn't ever worry about getting evicted out of an apartment like so many
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.780]   people do. My, my, my, my dad had a lot of flexibility. You know,
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.380]   he worked from home before that was even popular.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.260]   He had, he traveled all over the world.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.740]   But we, I didn't grow up in, in kind of the glitterati. I didn't grow up.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.340]   We didn't have a boat. We didn't go out on the weekends on the boat. I did.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.820]   We didn't go to the country club. You know, our vacations were,
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.740]   were rather modest. We didn't go out to eat a lot. And so I came from, from,
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.820]   from more humble financial background.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.820]   And I never really thought much about it until I became a financial advisor.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.940]   And when I was a financial advisor, I worked hard,
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.980]   but what I focused on was I focused on technical expertise.
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.100]   I studied hard to, to know how to give people good answers on,
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.460]   on tax planning or on financial planning. That was where my skillset was.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:01.020]   Then along the way somebody else joined my firm and this young man who joined
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.620]   the firm, he joined right out of college and it was his first,
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.420]   it was his first job right out of college.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.620]   He had never worked all throughout college, all throughout high school.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.620]   I had worked jobs, all kinds of jobs all throughout college and high school.
[00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   He'd never had a job. His dad was a very wealthy attorney,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.900]   extremely highly paid, I think a litigator, but I'm not sure,
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.340]   but extremely highly paid from the upper Northeast, kind of from that, that,
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.060]   that culture in the upper North, upper,
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.380]   and I can't remember if it was New York or Boston and I don't remember exactly,
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.380]   but it was from that culture. They had a place in Florida. He had a big,
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:42.740]   a huge fishing boat, you know, a $300,000 fishing boat.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.740]   And here was this young man who was 21 years old and or 22 years old gets this
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.140]   new job as a financial advisor. You know,
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.300]   he drives a BMW that his dad had given to him. He's got the boat,
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.620]   he's out on the boat every weekend, which in South Florida is of course a big,
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.420]   a big thing. And as I watched him, I was fascinated because from a, from a,
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:09.500]   from a, from a technical perspective, he was as a financial planner,
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.820]   in the beginning he was technically incompetent.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.660]   Now he was a smart man, but he was technically incompetent.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.700]   He didn't know what he was talking about. He didn't have an idea of the law.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.260]   He didn't have an idea of things. And I would do, I would go on,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.740]   I would go on appointments with him and you know, he, he,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.980]   he didn't know what a Roth IRA was. And yet here he is,
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.580]   here he is with a financial advisor.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.300]   He couldn't even explain the basics to people. And so I thought,
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.180]   there's no way this guy makes it, you know, there's no way that he,
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.300]   that he makes it in this business. Well, fast forward,
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.460]   not only did he make it,
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.820]   but he was one of the biggest producers that I ever knew.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.620]   And to this day, he's still in the, the, the business.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.140]   He's still in the financial business.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.020]   He's sold millions and millions of dollars of premium of life insurance.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   And he is just massively successful.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.340]   Now he studied over time. I left that business.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.780]   I haven't kept contact with him. I've watched him from afar.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.220]   He studied a little bit over time and I bet he's a little bit more technically
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.060]   competent.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.780]   But the thing that I observed is that he had something that I never had.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.980]   He had a comfort in he came from a different class of
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.940]   different financial class. And he looked at the world a different way.
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.780]   And he had a comfort of, of talking about money that I didn't have.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.820]   I remember the first time I, I was showing a life insurance policy to a guy
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.500]   with a hundred thousand dollars of annual premium. And I did this thing and I was
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.900]   inside, I'm shaking in my boots because I couldn't imagine somebody, you know,
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.740]   paying a hundred thousand dollars a year for their life insurance policy.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.180]   And this guy that I, that I showed it to was an entirely appropriate
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.940]   recommendation for him. It was,
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.940]   it was something that certainly could work out really well.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.740]   As far as it was a good fit for him. It was, it was ideal in, in so many ways,
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.940]   but I was scared in my boots because I couldn't imagine somebody paying a
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.700]   hundred thousand dollars a year for life insurance. But this guy, you know, my,
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.180]   my, my client, I think he made five or $6 million a year. And it was,
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.380]   it was an entirely reasonable thing given the financial plan that we had.
[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:16.660]   And my, my friend, he, he fit in that world.
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:20.420]   And so he didn't know anything about life insurance. I was bothered by,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.860]   I was totally bothered by all the technical things.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:25.380]   I'm usually buy term insurance and, and,
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.140]   and all the arguments about, well, this is superior and that's superior.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.740]   My friend was ignorant of all of that,
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.220]   but he flowed in that world in a way that I didn't have a clue how to flow.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.660]   And he sold so much insurance left, right, and center.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:39.940]   He had all his, his, his parents' contacts and,
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.580]   and he was a huge producer and is still today a huge producer,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.820]   even though his technical knowledge is, I hope this doesn't sound arrogant,
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.500]   but probably, you know, a 10th of mine. And I've, I've,
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:54.620]   I've pondered that over the years and I thought, what, why?
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.180]   Like, why does the world work that way?
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.500]   Why is it that some people have this, this experience and this,
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.820]   this mindset and why is it so hard for some of the rest of us to learn?
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.140]   And you, and when you, when you go and you start studying the,
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.220]   the mindset of money I have observed that there are those who,
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.220]   who have a hard time adapting to the mindset of money.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.820]   And there is those who don't.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.300]   And you can't deny the impact of your upbringing on yourself.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.300]   You can't deny the fact that the circumstances that you were raised in make it
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:32.780]   give you a different perspective. Now I still, you know,
[00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.660]   there are a lot of people who are raised in very wealthy families that are
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.460]   wonderful human beings. There are a lot of parents, though they be wealthy,
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:43.940]   who, who have, have succeeded in raising wonderful humans.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.900]   And I love, you love being around those people.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.740]   There are people who are warm that are generous, that are kind, et cetera.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.020]   And then of course, as with anything, there are people who are not.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:57.420]   So I don't think that money has to be the key in terms of that.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.340]   You can't raise a great kid. If you're, if you're rich, you obviously can.
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.460]   And then I think that often people are overly critical just simply through the
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.460]   jealousy of the wealthy. But I do also often appreciate the,
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:14.580]   the appreciate those who have started with humble beginnings and who've become
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.980]   very wealthy because they often have a kind of a different sense.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.420]   They appreciate it, but they also have had to learn new things.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.820]   And I've been learning over the years.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.540]   I've learned some of those things for myself. And so here's,
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.540]   so that was kind of a backstory to say,
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.900]   I don't know exactly the answer cause I'm still learning it.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.860]   But as I have grown in my personal wealth,
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.100]   as I have grown in my money making ability,
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:44.220]   I've realized how hard it is for me to imagine just simple things like money
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.100]   flowing easily.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.580]   You can earn money in a hard way and you can earn money in an easy way.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.060]   And depending on your history and your background,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.940]   you often look at these different solutions.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.500]   And yet there are lots of people who earn money very easily.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.580]   And you can earn a lot of money.
[00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.580]   One of the things that I've taken to doing it for myself and for others is I've
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.580]   realized that one of the most valuable things that I can do is to help somebody
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.940]   extend their vision. Now I'm growing increasingly confident of this,
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.740]   but I still can't even do it for myself.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.420]   I have to have friends and coaches and people who come alongside me who say,
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:23.180]   Joshua, you're thinking small. Why are you thinking so small? Why?
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.500]   Because in a lot of times we have these, I hate the term, I hate the term,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.420]   but it is true. We have these limiting beliefs, these ideas,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.540]   these scripts that are put within us
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.180]   based upon our experience.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.100]   And I think the important thing is to look at that and study and say,
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.740]   you know what? There's no reason why this has to be that way. You know,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:49.220]   I don't have to believe this limited idea. And that's where,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.140]   I don't know how to teach it because I'm still learning it.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:57.060]   But I'll tell you some things that have been helpful for me,
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.420]   specific tactics now. Number one,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.540]   is I've always found it helpful to learn from the experiences of others.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.580]   Now when I was growing up, I did that through reading,
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.180]   and I think you could still do it through reading.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.980]   But one of the major improvements in our modern world is the ability for one
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.980]   person on one side of the world to access someone on the other side of the world.
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.380]   And you can find people that have a very different experience and look at the
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.180]   world differently. You can listen to them and you can kind of learn from their
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.420]   idea and from their mentality. And so I find that to be useful.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.620]   Number two is by association. One of the big, most valuable things,
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.420]   it's just somebody to associate with people who have a different understanding
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.700]   of life. When I was a financial advisor,
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.900]   I used to have a group of friends who were financial advisors and we would talk
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.500]   about the fact that we could really only hang out with each other.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.660]   We could really only vacation with each other because we had a different
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.100]   experience of the world because of our time
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.060]   independence and our lifestyle independence.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:01.300]   And because we had a high income and because we
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.940]   had total control of our time,
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.340]   conversations would go something like this. It's like, "Hey,
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.900]   do you want to go hunting next week?" Or, "Let's take a trip.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.580]   Do you want to go fishing next week?" Or whatever it is.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.100]   Or, "Would you like to go out tomorrow?" It's like, "Hey,
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:19.340]   it's a Tuesday and would you like to go fishing with me tomorrow?" "Sure.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:20.860]   I'll just cancel all my appointments." Right?
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.220]   And you cancel all your appointments, move them around and renegotiate.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.580]   Half the time you don't even have to do that. You just say,
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.180]   you call your staff and you say, "Please cancel all my appointments." It's
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:33.900]   simple. And we would talk about how blessed we were to have that.
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.500]   But the fact that it was hard to associate with people who didn't because most
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.220]   people wouldn't look at the next week and say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.780]   You got an extra spot on the boat.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.340]   Let's go to the Bahamas and fish for a few days. I'll go. Absolutely.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.740]   I don't even need to check my schedule. I don't need to check.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.500]   I can renegotiate everything." And there was a difference.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.580]   That was a different lifestyle than a lot of people experienced.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.420]   But being around those kinds of people starts to change you.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.540]   And so it's one of those things where you're affected by it because you're part
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:00.740]   of it,
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.820]   but you're also become more and more part of it because you're affected by it.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.900]   So choosing carefully the kind of people that you associate with.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.820]   If you associate with business owners,
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.060]   you associate with people who are financially productive,
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:16.820]   they look at the world in a different way. And this is where I'm very
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.260]   sympathetic to people who are just getting started because I know so clearly
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.620]   what that's like. And I want to be the kind of person who gets excited with
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.460]   somebody all along the way. But many business owners just look at the world in a
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.860]   way that, for example, with you, hourly employees can't even imagine.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.340]   A business owner looks at the world and says, "If I do this,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.300]   I can make another half a million dollars next year." And that's doable.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.820]   But an hourly employee says, "I've got to make a raise by 5% and that's going to
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.020]   be my ticket to freedom." So association is really,
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.180]   really important. And then I think you can really very clearly,
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.500]   you can direct and change your mind.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.820]   You can change what you create in the world based upon what you see.
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.460]   And that's where I've worked hard over the years to change kind of what I see
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.180]   over the world. And sometimes you have to identify beliefs.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.020]   So I'll give you one for me.
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:12.580]   One of the biggest things for me in not being able to create kind of a really
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.940]   big future has always been the question of risk.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.700]   You know, risk. I don't want to risk something. And for me,
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.300]   it often comes down to just seeing and having worked with people who are in
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.180]   difficult circumstances, seeing how impactful risk can be in lives, right?
[00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.340]   When somebody goes bankrupt, it can destroy a family.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.660]   And since I consider family to be sacrosanct,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.300]   I consider marriage and my children to be one of my highest priorities in life,
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.620]   I wouldn't want to risk something for my children based upon that.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.220]   And so I've often been much more conservative. Meanwhile,
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.420]   there's people out there that just don't even consider risk.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.900]   I think the right solution is somewhere in the middle, right?
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.460]   Where you consider risk and you plan for it.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.260]   But what I've done is I've imagined different scenarios.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.620]   And then I think about how do I protect the downside?
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.340]   So why do I teach so much about asset protection planning?
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.220]   Because if you understand asset protection planning,
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.580]   you understand that if your business fails or you go bankrupt,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.740]   you don't have to be destitute. There's no reason for it.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:12.020]   And that's something that most people don't grasp is that you can use the
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.100]   laws to your effect. And so I found just by reading,
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:21.420]   by association, by intentionally feeding my head different
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.700]   pictures, that there's a real value to it.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.460]   One of the hardest things for me to let go has just simply been not being cheap
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.700]   in everything. And I think this is a common experience that many people face.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.380]   But that you have to learn at some point not to be cheap.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.500]   Now frugality is important at every stage.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.100]   If you are earning $7.50 an hour, you can't, I don't believe,
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:49.380]   maybe I'm wrong, right? But I don't believe you can just say, well,
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.500]   I'm just not going to be cheap. I'm going to be spendy.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.540]   And I'm going to create the reality. Well, I've never seen that work.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.540]   I've never heard of that working.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.060]   Somebody goes out and gets a credit card and starts buying a bunch of stuff.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:01.900]   So they look fancy.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.060]   I was talking with a young man recently about a cell phone.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.020]   He was like, my goal is to have a fancy cell phone.
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.100]   And I said, well, you know, I appreciate that.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.340]   And I tossed him my thousand dollar cell phone.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.140]   And I said, here's a thousand dollar cell phone.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.020]   I said, when I bought this, it was expensive and it was fancy.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.260]   But let me tell you that that kind of just consumption is not the key to
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.460]   happiness or anything. I said, it's a phone.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.340]   And as soon as you buy it,
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.420]   you think right now that having this fancy phone is going to fulfill you.
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   It's not. I said that if you keep with that mindset,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.060]   it just continues to, I got to have one more thing that's going to fulfill me.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.020]   And then I talked with him about some of the things that I have found to be
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:41.180]   helpful. And I said, you can have a thousand dollar phone,
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.980]   but the biggest mistake that a 17 year old makes is going out and spending a
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.580]   thousand dollar phone after tax.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.820]   You should know your business should own every single phone you ever use.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.780]   Every single computer should always be bought by your business.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.620]   Like you're a fool if you're paying for that stuff out of your personal checking
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.020]   account. And I said,
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.460]   you need to look at the world a little bit differently and back to kind of being
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.300]   cheap versus frugal.
[00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.900]   You realize at some point that you've got to change what you're doing.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.620]   And if you're not in change is uncomfortable.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.740]   So if you can't look back at the last year and say, you know what,
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.260]   that doesn't serve me anymore.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.820]   I've got to level up to this other belief or this other practice. You know,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.540]   for me, I made a commitment a few years ago. I was like, I'm not,
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:21.900]   I'm not staying in cheap hotels anymore. I'm not going to do it.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:27.540]   Because it's so destructive to my productivity that even though it's the
[00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.740]   greatest deal in the world, I'm not going to do it.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.220]   And I think you get there more and more in your life where as you start to earn
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.620]   more and you intentionally adjust that and you intentionally, you know,
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.180]   change where you are, you better be throwing away the things that didn't serve
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.660]   you. I was talking with a client of mine last week and we were talking about,
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.340]   you know, things like mowing your lawn. And it's like, you know,
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.500]   on the one hand I have children. I want my children to see me mowing my lawn.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.780]   I want them to know that I'm, I don't want,
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.180]   I don't want them to be detached from the things of life,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.860]   but I'm not going to risk my life and my brain.
[00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.460]   And this client I was speaking with, he's a surgeon. He's like,
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:07.740]   I cannot risk my livelihood that makes me a huge amount of money by going in and
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.940]   mowing a lawn. Same thing as like with going skiing, right?
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.340]   It's like, I'm not going to risk going on a ski vacation. I have to have, you know,
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:20.340]   these hands and these feet and this body makes me millions and millions of
[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.260]   dollars. I have to have that in first case.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.620]   So I'm not going to do the mow the lawn.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.420]   And what I've found over the years is I've found one of the most helpful things
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.700]   for me was some of Dan Sullivan's coaching on just simply time.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.780]   As an entrepreneur,
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:38.460]   one of the things that I have found is that there's no real connection to the
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.300]   amount of work that I put in versus the amount of output that I get out.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.300]   Years ago, I, and so I've learned to prioritize play.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.740]   I've learned to prioritize relaxation because that keeps my creativity flowing
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.940]   so that I can help more people more effectively.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.340]   The way I learned this was years ago with a podcast episode.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.820]   I was sitting and I was just wrestling and wrestling and wrestling with
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.660]   something and I was trying to grind it out.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.180]   I was trying to sit at my desk and just work, work, work, work, work, work, work,
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.580]   because that's the, that's kind of the working man's mentality.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.380]   I'm going to sit at my desk and I'm going to work, work, work, work, work.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.540]   And I couldn't, I couldn't even create the outline.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.100]   I turned the microphone on and nothing worked, nothing worked.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.740]   And finally I said, that's it. And I just quit. I said, I'm done.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.580]   I don't, I'm not going to do a show today. I'm done.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.580]   And I went for a walk with my children around the neighborhood.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.220]   And while I was on the walk in about five minutes,
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.420]   I instantly, I instantly, while I was playing with my kids,
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.940]   I instantly had a blinding, like clarity around the topic,
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:38.100]   instantly in my head, the entire thing organized itself. I came back home.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.660]   I spent three minutes writing down what was in my head.
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.940]   And then the next morning when I went back to my desk,
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:47.340]   I turned on the microphone and I recorded the show and it was a great show.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.220]   And I learned that I cannot force things to happen.
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.620]   And so I've learned to play, to relax. And even with regard to money,
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.540]   I've had to change my mindset around it,
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.500]   which brings me to my final recommendation.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:04.980]   I think the most effective way to change it is to set goals
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:09.660]   and to set big goals. I've taken again and again and again to advising people.
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.580]   It's like, why do you not have a 10 X goal for your income?
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.420]   And this is where if you come from a working class, I hate that term.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.740]   Everybody works, but I, you know, the pot, poorer class,
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.340]   an hourly wage kind of thing. Many people's goals is,
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:27.460]   is to make another dollar on your income,
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.580]   which is awesome, right? That's great.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.660]   But your goal needs to be to 10 X your income because that forces you to think
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.180]   differently. If you're making $20 an hour,
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.500]   the question is how can you make $200 an hour?
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.620]   Well, you can't do it by working harder.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.660]   You can't do it by doing it just a little bit more.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.060]   You have to do it by completely going in a different direction.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:50.980]   And that was one of the things that in my own life that's been helpful is I can't,
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.060]   I can't force experience onto myself that I,
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.860]   that I don't have.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:02.180]   I can't force a change of mind or change of beliefs if I'm lying to myself,
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.620]   I have to learn something where I actually believe it. I can't,
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:06.100]   I will not lie to myself.
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:10.900]   But what I can do is I can set goals that are aggressive, that are large.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.380]   And then those goals in time, when you set them and you think about them,
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.860]   and you work on them, even if you don't know how to achieve them,
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.620]   they generally will pull you forward into the future because you'll start to
[00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.300]   adjust things. You'll start to take different opportunities.
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.940]   You'll start to move in a different direction in a way that you wouldn't have
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   previously. And so if you're trying to figure out how do I change my money
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.900]   consciousness? How do I change these limiting beliefs?
[00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:40.900]   Reading, associating with different people, directing your mindset, analyzing,
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.780]   I think is good.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.380]   But I think the simplest place to start is just by simply setting goals,
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:49.660]   goals that scare you. And so don't set a goal of making 10% more,
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.340]   set a goal of making a thousand percent more and recognize that I don't have any
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.860]   idea how to do this. But in time, you know,
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:00.260]   my brain will direct me towards the opportunities that are here.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.380]   And so set the goal, think about it, think about what it would mean,
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.660]   even if you have no clue how to achieve it.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:09.900]   And in time that path will start to open up. That's the best I got for you.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.020]   So I'll give you the last word on that one.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.500]   Thanks Joshua. I appreciate that. And I,
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:20.580]   I read the goals book that was the first on your reading list and that was very
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.300]   helpful in thinking that way. So thank you for that recommendation. Um,
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.060]   I guess if you have time for one short followup,
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.220]   I think one of my biggest hangups is I'm sensitive to the criticism.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:36.900]   I feel I can just imagine a lot of my relatives listening to what you just said
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.740]   and saying, well, yeah, that's fine for those old fat cats. And you know,
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.340]   those wealthy guys that take somebody that changed the tires and somebody who's
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.220]   got to grow the food and we're never going to make that kind of money.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.140]   So blah, blah, blah, screw them. Um,
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.020]   have you experienced that sort of, I just, cause you know,
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.980]   if I go home and I talk to my parents about my goals and they respond that way,
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.420]   that's going to be very disheartening.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   You have any experience with that sort of thing?
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:02.260]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.900]   I think the first thing is I would never talk about my goals with people who are
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:09.140]   going to make fun of them. Um, there are people, and especially like,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.460]   you don't get to choose the family that you're part of. Um,
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.780]   you don't choose where you're planted,
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.940]   but I don't talk about my goals that I have with people who are going to make
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.860]   fun of them. Right. I, I, just a simple thing, right? Right. Like I,
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:24.860]   I like to, I sometimes enjoy studying languages and I have an ambition to be a
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:26.900]   polyglot. That's one of my personal goals.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.620]   If I go to a group of polyglots and I tell them my ambition, they tell me,
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:34.020]   this is great, man. That's easy. Yeah. Last year I learned German. Um, you know,
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:38.060]   right now this quarter I'm working on, uh, on Russian and then I'm going to pick
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.220]   up Mandarin, uh, Chinese in the fourth quarter.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.660]   And so you just get this totally different idea versus where you go to the
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.380]   average person and say, you know, I'd like to learn six languages.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.540]   I've got a list of eight. My personal, the languages I want are eight. Uh,
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.860]   those, that's what I'm, I'm, I'm working on. And so you go to a polyglot and I'm
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.740]   like, yeah, man, that's great. It might take you four or five years,
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.660]   but you'll get there. Um, then you're going to, it's going to be great.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.540]   But you tell most people I want to learn eight languages and they laugh at you.
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.900]   So that's a non-financial thing. And, but it's, it's really serious. Now with
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.420]   money, same thing is that if you have an ambition to make a million dollars a
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.980]   year, don't tell that to somebody who's making $30,000 a year. Um,
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.100]   but if you go to somebody who's making, um,
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.780]   half a million dollars a year or a million dollars a year or a few million
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.060]   dollars a year, and you say, I have an ambition to make a million dollars a
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.020]   year. Say, absolutely. So tell your goals to people who are going to encourage
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.380]   you. Same thing with like being fat, right? Um,
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:26.500]   if you go to a personal trainer and you're really fat and you say,
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.140]   I don't want to be fat anymore, they're going to say, you can do it.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.780]   Absolutely. Because they've worked with people and help people not be fat
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.260]   anymore. Whereas if you go to a fat person, they're going to tear you down.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.940]   And so don't tell your goals to people who are going to make fun of them.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:41.860]   You've got to protect that until you've developed the personal confidence to
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.940]   just look them in the face and say, okay, you don't have to believe it.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.580]   But practically speaking,
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.100]   I would say also you've got to work through some of the ethical issues.
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:54.540]   And this is where people, many people have a real flawed ideology,
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.220]   especially around money. Um,
[00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.780]   if you see money as something that you get based upon exploitation,
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.980]   you'll never feel comfortable with earning a lot of money or with having a lot
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   of money. And so that's one of the most destructive things that when somebody
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:16.020]   has this idea that billionaires should not exist, uh,
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.900]   they, they, they're,
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.180]   they're totally destructive to themselves and to society in general. Um,
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:25.900]   whereas my ideology, my philosophy is very simple.
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:30.820]   Money comes through service. And so if I can serve more people,
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.860]   then I can earn more money.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:38.620]   And so for me that's entirely congruent with my ideology. Um, now that of course,
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:43.140]   comes out of Christian theology. The scripture is crystal clear as far as, um,
[00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.300]   the, the economic systems, et cetera.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.180]   But I've known a lot of people who believe that the more money you have,
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.740]   the more people you've exploited. Now, I think simultaneously,
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:55.700]   you've got to, to, um, uh, watch out for those other, those other sides of it.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.220]   For example, when I do the, I'm,
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.620]   I am furious about the stimulus and the bailout and whatnot happening
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.460]   in the United States,
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.780]   because what I see happening is a complete and total moral travesty where people
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.940]   are getting rich based upon exploitation.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.980]   And so you need an ethical system that brings these things together.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.660]   So if you're concerned about these things first, don't tell anybody,
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:20.180]   but then you have to build an ideology or an F and an ethical system, uh,
[00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   in your, in your experience that allows you to know where does success
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.500]   come from and then allows you to work through that. So set the goals,
[00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.020]   work on it, and I'll continue to, uh, to try to help you with it, uh, here,
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:36.900]   um, on the show as we proceed forward. All right, Daniel in Florida,
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.340]   welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.900]   Hey, Joshua, thank you for taking my call.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:46.180]   And I was really glad to hear your coronavirus update in the beginning. Uh,
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.900]   not least of all, because it exactly mirrors the way I'm thinking.
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.780]   So confirmation bias makes me happy.
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.100]   You're right. Absolutely. You're exactly right about all of it. You're a smart man.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:00.100]   Along those lines, um, I,
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:04.220]   I have maybe an ethical question would be the best way to pose it. Um,
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.860]   and while I don't expect necessarily an ethical guidance out of you, um,
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:13.220]   I know that you and I think very similarly, um, with regard to,
[00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:18.300]   uh, politics and, and maybe, maybe you can use yourself as a proxy here.
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.460]   And hopefully this is interesting to members of the audience who I know kind of
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.380]   fall into the same category. Um, but part of this disastrous, uh,
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:31.740]   wealth transfer bailout is, um, the expansion of some,
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:38.500]   um, sorry, brain fart here, uh, of some, some unemployment insurance,
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.980]   which I think is probably the least odious portion of it. Um,
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.060]   and I am self-employed. I work in the service industry. Uh,
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.340]   business is dried up.
[00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.740]   I'm either refunding a lot of business or business is getting kicked down the
[00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:51.660]   road until next year.
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:56.060]   And I'm not concerned because I'm early as a result of listening to the show
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.140]   since the beginning, uh, I have months and months of runway,
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:00.740]   so there's no concern here.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.740]   But what I'm wondering is I'm technically unemployed and I understand from,
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.500]   uh, some people in my industry who,
[00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.700]   who aren't in a similar financial position that that is now being extended to
[00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:17.340]   business owners who are in a similar situation. Is it
[00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:23.580]   unethical of me to, you know, to be cashing these checks? Um,
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:27.340]   the way that I typically look at stuff like this is even though I'm not
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:31.700]   currently paying or assume I'm not currently paying unemployment insurance
[00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:35.180]   premiums I have in the past as a W2 employee, um, you know,
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:39.500]   my money and my children's money is being given to Boeing and to the cheesecake
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.060]   factory and all other sorts of things that I don't feel it should be going to is
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.580]   this just me kind of clawing my own money back, uh, so to speak. And, you know,
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.780]   if this thing does go on for a year, um, I'm, I'm going to be hurting too.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.020]   So I guess the too long didn't read version is,
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:55:00.220]   am I gaming the system by, uh,
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.700]   getting benefits that I'm not necessarily currently in need of?
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:09.700]   I hate this question. Um, because it's, it has,
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.740]   it's so difficult and it's so fraught. Um,
[00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:18.980]   in 2008 I was laid off from a job.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.020]   I was working for a marketing and brand management consulting company and they
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.580]   laid me off. I don't think it was, it was right.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.500]   It was just a little bit before the recession happened.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:33.140]   And so I don't think they laid me off because of the recession as I understood
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:34.140]   it and think to be true.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.660]   They laid me off just simply because they chose to reorganize the company.
[00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.140]   I had been hired into the job.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.740]   It was kind of a middle level job and the company,
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.860]   it just wasn't really working.
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:46.060]   And so they got rid of me and several of my coworkers simultaneously.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:50.660]   Now prior to that time I had worked really hard to stabilize my personal
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.540]   finances. I was out of debt. I was doing the Dave Ramsey plan.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:57.060]   I was out of debt. I was at a six month emergency fund in the bank and I was,
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:00.020]   I worked hard to make that happen. I paid off all my student loans.
[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:03.500]   I was just out of college. I had, uh, I'd worked really hard and I,
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:07.820]   I felt really good and I felt confident about the work that I had done in my own
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.500]   personal finances. And, um,
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:15.020]   I was given a, a severance pay. I forget how much now,
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.740]   but I had some severance pay from the company, which was also nice.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.780]   It was the first time I'd ever experienced kind of the benefit of working in the
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:23.700]   corporate world where they give you a nice severance package when you leave
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.220]   instead of just, Hey, here's your last paycheck and get out the door. Um,
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:31.740]   but I didn't file for unemployment and I didn't file for unemployment even though
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:36.740]   I was eligible because I, I felt like I didn't need it.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:41.140]   I felt I've always had this, I've wanted to be congruent,
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:46.140]   ethically congruent with the fact that I, uh, you know,
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:50.300]   that, that I can take care of myself. I believe in personal responsibility.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.580]   I believe in not being a burden to others. I believe that,
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.780]   that needs should go, that money should go to people who need it.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.220]   And I believe that money should go to people who need it voluntarily based upon
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.580]   the charity of other people. But I have, um, I have,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.780]   but I didn't need it. Right. I'm an able-bodied man. I can work.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.500]   And I just felt like it was, there was no need for me to do it.
[00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:13.100]   So I never went and filed for unemployment.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:15.820]   Now in the middle of that 2008 crisis,
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:18.620]   they kept on extending unemployment and fast forward.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.060]   I lived on my savings for a couple of years for a couple of months. I worked,
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.900]   looked around and that was when I started working as a financial advisor.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:29.980]   Then here I am as a financial advisor and I started in the fall of 2008 and
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.580]   unemployment benefits went on, I think all through 2009.
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.620]   The timeline is a little fuzzy in my head,
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.980]   but they extended it for a significant amount of time.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.060]   And here I go as a financial advisor and I had run out of money. I was,
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:45.300]   I burned through my emergency fund little by little over time.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   And then as a financial advisor, I was completely underpaid.
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.780]   I didn't make money right in the beginning.
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:52.940]   And so I was going through my savings and I ran out of money.
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:58.020]   And yet here I am working with people who are living on unemployment and they
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.340]   weren't trying to find a job.
[00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:02.940]   They were just sitting back and collecting unemployment. And as I,
[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:06.300]   as I'm here, I'm trying to tell them about money. I'm totally broke.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.940]   And here they are living on the beach in Florida,
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.660]   living on unemployment because they got laid off from their job nine months ago.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:17.260]   And I got so frustrated with that. And I just thought, what a sucker I am.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:18.780]   You know, why didn't I do that?
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:23.740]   Because if I had taken that time and I had spent that time focused on
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:28.940]   something else instead of focused on, on, you know,
[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:33.580]   what's happening here, basically I was, I felt like a sucker. And I said,
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.780]   you know what, that's it. Never again. I'm always going to take,
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.500]   I'm always going to take it. Then I went back and I,
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.380]   and I looked at the ethics of, of unemployment.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:44.420]   So my employer paid for unemployment insurance, not by choice.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:48.420]   It was an insurance program and insurance policy that they paid into and they
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.660]   were given no option for it.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.100]   They were coerced by the government into participating in that.
[00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:57.220]   I was laid off under all the terms of, of, uh, of the,
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:02.100]   the whole scenario. And in that situation, I thought, you know,
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.700]   why would I, um, why would I,
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:08.260]   why shouldn't I have taken it? And so I came to the perspective.
[00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.620]   I was like, I'm just gonna take it from now on. Uh, and then the same,
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.780]   I've had the same thing with social security. Like I don't like social security,
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.180]   but am I not going to cash my social security checks?
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.020]   And I had the same thing with basically all government benefits where I don't
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:25.220]   get a choice. And so if I don't get a choice, then why shouldn't I take it?
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.620]   And then the vindictive side of my personality comes out where I'm like,
[00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.900]   ah, you know what, this whole thing is going to collapse.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.340]   I'm going to hasten the collapse and I'm going to screw the whole system over.
[00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.100]   I've for years, I've thought about, you know,
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.500]   I'm going to do a whole show on how to exploit all of the government systems.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.740]   And I've just never wanted to do that ethically.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:45.740]   And then all of a sudden I turn around and I see these trillions of dollars
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.900]   over the last day or two being given to these companies. And I'm furious.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:54.540]   It infuriates me that they would, that they would do that.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.500]   And I think that's it. Like,
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.780]   why am I trying to live this ethical life of not,
[00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.860]   not taking from other people, not still like, why don't I just get, get what,
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.860]   get me some and why don't I actually help individuals? Cause you know,
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.340]   Boeing doesn't need this money.
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.420]   Boeing needs to go bankrupt is what they need to do.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:12.820]   Why am I sitting here worrying about, well, maybe I'm, you know,
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:14.420]   maybe if I create this content,
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.820]   maybe I would be unethical because I'm helping somebody who is,
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.140]   who is a broke to, to, to figure out how to,
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:28.340]   maybe I'm, you know, worrying about Daniel.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:32.460]   What if I help Daniel sit back and live on, on, on unemployment? It's just,
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.340]   it's infuriating when you see the numbers.
[01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:39.740]   And so how I've solved it is just by largely walking away.
[01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.660]   And by walking away, I feel a lot freer,
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.740]   but I don't expect many people to do that. You can't, you know,
[01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.540]   you don't get an option if you're in the United States.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.060]   And so I've walked away to two cultures that are freer than the United States.
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.140]   And that's helped me to do it. But you know, I still pay taxes.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.980]   And so I intend to cash my check if they give me a check.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.700]   So that's the background of the story is that I came to the conclusion that
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.820]   since I didn't have a choice in the law,
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:10.180]   that I didn't have a choice in them passing unemployment insurance,
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.500]   I didn't have a choice in it that I should have taken it.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.980]   And I was a sucker in 2008 for not taking it.
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.580]   I could have done so many better things with my life and with my finances.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.380]   If I had taken it, then just simply spending all my savings down,
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.260]   it would have been a lot easier for me to,
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.620]   to have lived on unemployment for a few months until I found a job and then had
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.700]   still had my savings to,
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:36.780]   than it was for me to spend down my savings and then be totally broke starting
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.940]   a job. Cause that was, that was really hard. It was really hard.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.420]   And so I've, the ethics of it are,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:47.460]   are generally unclear as far as like, I don't think that there's an,
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.380]   I don't think that since you didn't have a choice in the law,
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.460]   you didn't have a choice in establishing the law.
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:57.380]   You didn't have a choice in the coercion. All of your neighbors, right?
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.260]   If you voted for it, well, that's, that's an ethical problem,
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.540]   but all of your neighbors had voted for this, this coercive state.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.780]   And so if you didn't have a choice,
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:10.060]   you're following the law along the way by paying your taxes and doing what's
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.140]   expected of you. You didn't have a choice in these
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:19.020]   representatives and what they have passed. And so I say cash the checks,
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.940]   cash the checks and then use them for yourself.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:24.540]   And then if you have the opportunity to be free of the system,
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.380]   be free of the system. If not save the money,
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:30.100]   just put the money in the bank and save it and spend it on something else.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:32.980]   And if you want to do something that's ideologically pure,
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.260]   then leverage it for something that's going to make the difference.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:38.940]   So if you don't need the money just put it into your giving account and go give
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.420]   it to somebody who needs it more than you.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:45.420]   If you want to invest the money into building a website that,
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.060]   that full of screeds against unemployment insurance, then go ahead.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.780]   But I say if you're eligible for the checks while,
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:55.940]   while following the law so that you don't hurt your conscience,
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.340]   I say cash them and use the money.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.740]   But I understand the dilemma that you're in. It's a really frustrating one.
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:08.660]   All right. I guess I'm two for two with confirmation bias today.
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.300]   So I appreciate that answer.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.780]   You should call in every week and then we'll be,
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.260]   then you can get it every week.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:17.100]   That's a good plan.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.740]   All right. Thanks Daniel. All right.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.220]   We go to, I don't know, seven two Oh area code. Welcome to the show.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.540]   How can I serve you today? Denver, Colorado. Go ahead, please.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:34.100]   All right. Denver, Colorado. We'll come back to you. It looks like Dave,
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.260]   you're up Dave. Welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, please?
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.780]   Hey Josh. Thank you.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.860]   Thank you for your thoughts and comments over the past couple of weeks.
[01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.980]   Question for you about the way you're thinking about
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.820]   investing in this opportunity.
[01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:54.300]   You've said that you've been waiting for this in terms of an opportunity to get
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:54.860]   back in.
[01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:59.620]   And how do you think about doing that if it's into stocks
[01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:04.220]   in terms of actually deploying assets that are on the side and that now is the
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.060]   chance.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:08.340]   So I don't intend to invest in stocks.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.420]   I am disgusted personally by the stock market.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.420]   I know that's a strong word. I'm not,
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.420]   I'm not asking anybody to believe what I believe,
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:21.780]   but even just the last this bailout I consider it just a giant wall street
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.620]   giveaway.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:27.180]   I walked away from stocks and mutual funds a number of years ago,
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.500]   not because of any problem with owning stock, right?
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.540]   I own stock in my own companies and I'm happy to buy stock,
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:36.580]   but I walked away from wall street just because of the broad,
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.660]   complete immorality in the industry. As far as I see it,
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.820]   it's one of the most corrupt places on the world.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:47.860]   If you look at the crony capitalism, what wall street,
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:53.820]   what wall street does is basically the most important person in a modern
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   large company is the lobbyists who,
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.300]   who you have seen in full force this last week.
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.980]   They don't even make any pretense at this point in time of,
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.700]   of taking care of their company.
[01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:08.140]   And the U S representatives don't even make a pretense of pretending that
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:09.980]   there's any sense of personal responsibility.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:12.060]   There's any risk whatsoever for a stockholder.
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.500]   And so I see it as a, as an incredibly immoral world with people within it,
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.580]   certainly trying to do the best, but in general,
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.340]   the system rewards unethical and immoral behavior.
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:29.540]   I also have a very deep concern about many of the industries that the companies
[01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:33.900]   are involved in their promulgation of violence around the world with many of the
[01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.060]   large companies that really bothers me.
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:40.460]   I have a deep concern about a lot of the ethics inside the companies.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:45.820]   And I just came to a point four or five, three or four years ago where I said,
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:51.220]   I'm not gonna, I can't do this anymore.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.420]   I can't have this on my conscience. So kind of the ethical thing,
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.580]   just like the previous question,
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:06:00.300]   I can't change the law about my requirement to participate in, in,
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.460]   in unemployment insurance. I'm coerced to do that,
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.340]   but nobody is coercing me to buy stock in a company like Boeing.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.820]   Nobody is coercing me to buy stock in a company like Northrop Grumman, right?
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:16.180]   Nobody is coercing me into owning these companies.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.860]   And so I don't want that on my conscience.
[01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:20.100]   Now I understand that's an extreme position. I'm,
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.020]   I'm expressing it very clearly here because I'm furious at what has happened over
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.980]   the last couple of days. I'm furious at the US government,
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:34.140]   taking money that has been extracted with threats of violence from individuals
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.740]   and from companies all around the country,
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:41.140]   and then turning around and writing huge checks to basically bail out Wall
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.180]   Street,
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.940]   both the financial players in Wall Street and the stockholders of these
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.780]   companies.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.620]   And I consider that to be an absolute violation of the principles of,
[01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:57.300]   of the free market and completely destructive.
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:58.620]   And I don't want to be involved in it.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:03.540]   So I have no interest or intention of going back to you know,
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:07.180]   the stock market. I have no interest in investing broadly in that system.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.420]   I'm interested in investments that help people and not that harm people.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.940]   So I can talk about it in a detached way of, okay,
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.100]   well let's talk about the market. You know, is it a good time to get in?
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.420]   But for me, I'm not, I'm not going into that again.
[01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.540]   Just because I don't want to be in, I don't,
[01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:24.340]   I don't want to arrive at the end of my life and yeah,
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.500]   I've got an extra couple of million bucks here, but it came at this,
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.220]   at this cost to me. Now I'm, again, I'm not saying you're wrong or that you,
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.620]   you behaved immorally. Those are my opinions.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:36.140]   Those are my convictions and the reasons behind them.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:40.100]   And I think that we're all free to do in a situation like this,
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:40.980]   what you need to do.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:46.260]   So the technical answer just from a detached observer is I would say that a lot
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.380]   of it comes down to your time perspective.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:54.060]   If you are looking to grab the exact bottom of, of the stock market,
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:58.420]   is this it? I don't think so. But it doesn't really matter.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.060]   If you've got a list of companies that you're interested in,
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.460]   that you think you'd like to own, you know, 10, 15, 20 years from now,
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.340]   it's hard to believe that these companies that are so big and so influential
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.620]   will not be worth more in the future. And they're,
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.980]   they're in many ways fairly valued today. Could they still fall more? Maybe,
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.940]   but I've always been attracted to the longterm value investing proposition and
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:24.340]   to just simply buying companies that are strong and that, that are,
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.780]   that are good. And so I think there are some,
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:28.260]   some companies that are fairly priced at the moment.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:30.820]   And so if you believe that they're fairly priced, I think that,
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:36.340]   I think that it's fine to get in. If, but, but I'm not predicting the bottom.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.060]   I'm not putting the top.
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:40.020]   A lot of it depends on what I led the show out with of this analysis.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.780]   And we just simply don't know what's going to happen here in the coming days.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:48.140]   And so the market's going to, to respond to that. I am in the days to come,
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.740]   I am going to talk about though the market in general. And I've,
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.660]   I've spoken with some,
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:56.500]   some of my private clients just about this that I increasingly wonder because of
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.220]   some of these ethical issues, some of the monetary issues, et cetera,
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:02.740]   I do increasingly wonder about the longterm value of the stock market.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:07.700]   The basic, the basic idea is always don't say this time is different.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:12.500]   Right. And don't say, don't bet against America. But I, I, I, at this point,
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.380]   I reject those, those, those statements. They're logical fallacies.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.180]   You can say,
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:21.340]   you can acknowledge the fact that the United States of America has been
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:26.020]   historically strong while also recognizing that there are lots of
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.860]   historically strong countries, cultures, et cetera,
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:33.620]   throughout history that have changed and are no longer so historically strong.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:39.220]   You can look at that and you can say that this time you can say,
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.820]   don't think that this time is different,
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:44.380]   but you have to also acknowledge that this time could be different,
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.940]   that there could be changes.
[01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:50.340]   And I think that there are major systemic headwinds at the very least,
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:51.820]   but they need to be called headwinds,
[01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:57.220]   if not major opportunities for disaster in the future in the United States of
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.220]   America and for many of these companies.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.500]   Now to the extent that things can continue to run as normal,
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.300]   where Wall Street rewards these companies for taking huge risks,
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:10.860]   where the companies pay no attention to thrift,
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.740]   pay no attention to preparing themselves for market downturns,
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:19.060]   but they just simply spend like crazy. Don't, you know,
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.060]   buy their stock back to enrich all of their directors and managers.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:27.300]   And then to the extent that they are bailed out by the US taxpayer and by the
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:31.780]   Federal Reserve and the tax to the extent that the US citizens don't care,
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.100]   but just simply rejoice that the money's there in their 401k,
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.700]   maybe this will go on. You know, maybe it will,
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.620]   maybe it'll go on for my entire lifetime and it'll never collapse. But I,
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.660]   I really,
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:45.420]   I really wonder about how you can have a system that's so clearly unethical that
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.900]   rewards such, such terrible business behavior.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.140]   I don't see how that continues with the same,
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:55.540]   the same sense of strength over time.
[01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.100]   And that's where we get back to this moral hazard question.
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.020]   I'll try to cover this philosophically, but the moral hazard is real.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.540]   I just compared 2008 to 2020. 2008,
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:09.220]   everyone said don't bail out the companies because it'll create moral hazard.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.900]   And those arguments were largely ignored.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.180]   Now at first they were listened to and then they were largely ignored because
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.100]   all the US congressional representatives got scared when they said,
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.060]   "Oh, the whole world's going to collapse." Well, David Stockman's book,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:24.580]   The Great Deformation, that convinced me that it was unnecessary.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.020]   Now maybe Stockman is not agreed on by everybody,
[01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.420]   but he convinced me that it was entirely unnecessary and that the people that at
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.380]   that point cried out to their representatives and said,
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.060]   "Don't bail these people out." They were right.
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.500]   And the representatives were wrong. Well, now in 2020, what do you see?
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:39.620]   You of course see a historic economic change,
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.580]   but these companies don't even bother to,
[01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.340]   they don't even make a pretense anymore. It's like,
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.580]   "Oh, let's go send our lobbyist and get some money." It's, to me,
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.740]   I find it disgusting. So I don't,
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.980]   I'm disinterested in the subject except from a trading perspective and I'll let
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.580]   other people do that. What I am,
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.380]   I do think that there will be opportunities in the real estate market.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.820]   I consider private business and real estate to be less ethically troublesome
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.860]   for me personally than those large companies.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.420]   And so I'm actively looking for,
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.940]   I've been waiting for a recession so that I can build a real estate portfolio at
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:13.820]   reasonable prices.
[01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:16.580]   I've been hoarding cash and watching for that.
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.380]   And so that's what I'm looking for.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.460]   But the problem is it's just simply too soon right now to be engaged in any kind
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.060]   of real estate discussion.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:29.060]   The path ahead is so unclear and real estate is such a long
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.700]   timeframe that there's no immediate opportunity that's clear at the
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:36.380]   moment. So that's my answer Dave, probably not the answer you're expecting,
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.220]   but that's my answer.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.420]   Yep, no, I follow and thanks for your thoughts on it.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.300]   All right. My pleasure. We go now to, looks like Darson. Darson,
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.620]   welcome to the show. How can I serve you today, sir?
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:55.420]   Lost him. All right. We go back to Denver. Let's see if Denver is here.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:57.060]   Denver, welcome to the show. How can I serve you today?
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.620]   Hey Josh, I'm here in Denver. I actually just logged in to listen.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.420]   So no question today.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.860]   No question today. Well, I think that wraps us up on terms of callers.
[01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.300]   So I am glad that, glad that you all called in.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.220]   I hope I wasn't too strong with my language. I do, I do wrestle with that.
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:19.580]   Sometimes I'm prone to hyperbole just in my own thinking.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:23.460]   I try to control that, but I've been forthright.
[01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:28.940]   I'll try to, as soon as the details become clear of this bill and the mechanism,
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.180]   I'll try to serve you with some information on that as far as the stimulus bill
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.620]   and how you can, how you can do that. But I guess in closing,
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.500]   as I create a little closing speech here, I would say
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:45.500]   one of the most important things to learn right now in this current economic
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:51.340]   crisis is just simply what a total house of cards we are.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:56.580]   A little bit of vulgar language warning ahead, but I saw this,
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:02.580]   I saw this tweet by some random guy on, on Twitter and he wrote,
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   he wrote this tweet. He says,
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.380]   "LOL we're a bunch of paycheck to paycheck employees living in apartments owned
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:12.220]   by paycheck to paycheck landlords and working for paycheck to paycheck
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.740]   corporations. LMAO whole economy full of broke bitches.
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:21.180]   Whose idea was this?" I just thought I couldn't set it better myself.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.220]   I would have of course used less vulgar language,
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.980]   but so there's a truth in that that's pretty clearly expressed is if you
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.420]   thought that all of a sudden we're strong, just look around the world right now.
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.460]   What I thought I was, I've always thought, okay, Josh,
[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:38.260]   you're too much of a catastrophist. You're too negative.
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.260]   Why are you being so pessimistic? Be positive, right? Everything go better.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:47.900]   We're barely two weeks into this thing and I acknowledge the widespread in the
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:53.100]   United States. I mean, we're barely two weeks into like the shutdowns,
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:57.380]   the lockdowns, et cetera. I acknowledge the widespread hurt.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.660]   I feel that deeply emotionally,
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:03.700]   I'm very filled with empathy for those who are hurting.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.940]   I want to serve you if you're hurting. I know that we're all hurting.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.260]   We all know people who are losing their jobs.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:14.260]   I have a lot of listeners in this audience who've had to lay off huge staff
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.980]   and that's distinctly painful.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.580]   I remember the first time I laid somebody off and I just thought like this is
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:24.660]   huge. I remember just the weight of that. I never had a lot of employees.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:29.060]   You think about the weight of an entrepreneur who's supporting dozens or
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.460]   hundreds of families with their business and they have to go and lay people off.
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.220]   It's difficult. It's awful for the employees. It's awful for the employers.
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.420]   It's terrible.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:43.060]   But we're not even two weeks into these widespread shutdowns and lockdowns.
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:50.540]   And yet in the middle of that, everyone's got to come running for,
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.180]   everyone's got to come running for money.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.020]   I expect this to get worse economically.
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.100]   I'm optimistic and hoping for the best in the virus and I'm hoping that this
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:03.500]   cannot be, you know, one of those generation defining events like previous
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.740]   depressions, like previous flu outbreaks, et cetera. I'm hoping it's not that.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:12.020]   I'm prepared for it, but hoping it's not that. But at the end of the day,
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.660]   even if we get things better, look around.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.780]   If this turns out to be a short term scenario,
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:22.660]   we're a bunch of paycheck to paycheck employees living in apartments owned by
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.660]   paycheck to paycheck landlords and working for paycheck to paycheck to
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:30.740]   corporations. Whole economy from top to bottom,
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:34.940]   full of broke people. That doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in me.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:40.380]   When in less than two weeks of a shutdown, you have to have what seems like,
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:43.860]   which is certainly it's an overstatement, but what seems like every company,
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.060]   every big company in your S&P 500 saying, we need money, you know, give us money.
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.140]   Now, of course that's an overstatement and exaggeration,
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.220]   but that's kind of the feeling that you get. It's like,
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.100]   well let's send our lobbyists and let's go get some money.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:00.060]   Where's that money come from? Right? It's all made up. It's all fake.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.500]   It's all printed. $2 trillion stimulus bill.
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.820]   You didn't earn that. You didn't pay for it.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.780]   Government was already a trillion dollars in debt. Sorry, trillion dollar deficit,
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.140]   already a trillion dollar deficit.
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:17.100]   So it was add another 2 trillion on it while simultaneously the GDP declines by,
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.500]   you know, whatever percent, 20%, 30%, who knows.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.900]   And tax revenue is going to go down. So I mean,
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.580]   the deficit this year is going to be horrendous.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.940]   And that's in addition to the trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.380]   made up by the federal reserve. Now,
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.460]   I don't want to end on a catastrophic note. I want to be a voice of optimism,
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.420]   of positivity. I really do.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.820]   But I think we've got to recognize what a nightmare,
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.860]   what an absolute nightmare.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:46.220]   Now I'm grateful that personally I'm doing pretty well.
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.100]   And I'm grateful that I've received so many messages from you that have told me
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.660]   I'm doing well. You heard earlier, Daniel said, you know, I'm doing well.
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:58.460]   It doesn't take that much to be prepared for most
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:02.100]   catastrophes. You know, it's not that hard to have two weeks of savings.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.740]   Anybody can have two weeks of savings.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.780]   It's not that hard for most companies to have a few weeks of savings.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.780]   Anybody can do that. Now, just because a company is laying people off,
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.820]   doesn't mean they don't have savings,
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.220]   but it's pretty shocking to see how fast things can change.
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.900]   So the key is preparation works. Financial prudence works.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.060]   Being conservative with your money works. Planning ahead works.
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:25.740]   Choosing quality investments works. Everything works,
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.620]   but we're surrounded by people who,
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.420]   and a system that rewards the worst of behaviors.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.580]   Those are my long-term concerns. Now,
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.100]   there's going to be opportunity left, right, and center through this thing.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:41.500]   There's opportunity right now, possibly in the investing markets.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:45.020]   I know there's a lot of people who've been waiting for a decline in market
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.340]   values to be able to get in. I don't think you'd be a big mistake.
[01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.100]   If you've got a, you know, 15 years and you're saying, what is 2035 look like?
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.860]   I'm not convinced that the world is going to fall apart and all these companies
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.980]   are going to collapse. Everything is still there. I don't,
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:02.900]   I'm not that catastrophic right now. I really not. So maybe this is, you know,
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.620]   if you're young and you want to invest in the markets, probably a good plan.
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:10.620]   It's hard to see, especially given the current scenario,
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.620]   it's hard to see those things not working.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.420]   And when you've got the government backing up your investment,
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.180]   you got to say it's pretty good investment, right?
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:19.780]   Kind of like government backed mortgage loans, right?
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.380]   If the government's going to backstop you and you can't lose money and you know
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.340]   that your shares in Boeing corporation are never going to go to zero because the
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.540]   government will step in and bail them out. Well, you can't,
[01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.820]   you're not stupid for investing in those markets.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:33.660]   And so it's probably a good thing.
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:37.340]   I think there's going to be opportunities increasing for new businesses,
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.900]   new business adjustments. There's going to be big,
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.300]   big changes in society from this, no matter what,
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.940]   even the most optimistic scenario,
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:46.100]   there's going to be change and change creates opportunities for those who have
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.260]   a mind for it. So be looking for that.
[01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:51.140]   Stabilize your personal finances as much as you can.
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.260]   Cash your checks and help your neighbors. That's the best I got.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.980]   I am searching for something positive, but that's what I got. Anyway,
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.820]   in closing, if you'd like to join me for next week's Q and a show,

[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.660]   Last few days on my March madness consulting deal.

[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.420]   And I've been on the phone nonstop helping people,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.660]   help people heading into bankruptcy,
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.980]   help people with huge amounts of money,
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.780]   help people with businesses that are booming right now and businesses that are
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.180]   failing. So if you'd like to work with me personally,
[01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.860]   reach out to me by email joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com. In closing,
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.820]   also, let me just mention again,
[01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.860]   I had a bunch of new people buying my how to survive and thrive during the
[01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:48.140]   coming economic crisis course. I thank you for that.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.820]   Running a sale on all my courses.
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:53.820]   You can go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store and then basically the last
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.140]   week, if you would like to buy my radical preparedness course,
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:00.700]   go to radicalpreparedness.com. That's very practical. 29 bucks minus 20%,
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:01.780]   whatever that comes out to be.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:05.620]   You're not going to get a better deal off than that. I'm finishing that course.
[01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:09.420]   It's 24 bucks, super cheap. But I'm finishing that course this week,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.180]   and then I'm going to reshoot it and the price is going to be a lot higher.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:16.140]   So if you would like to get in while things are inexpensive,
[01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:21.060]   if you're a deal hound, go to radicalpreparedness.com and sign up for that course there.
[01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.540]   Radicalpreparedness.com. Thank you for being here and I'll be back with you soon.
