[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.600]   - And Christmas has arrived.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   And from the entire team who serves at Desiring God
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.760]   and from Pastor John and from myself,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.360]   we all wanna wish you a very Merry Christmas.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.520]   The incredible Christmas story
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400]   of God breaking into this world is true
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.200]   and it really is incredible.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.600]   God has taken on flesh.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.020]   And that is a story that rings of God's glory
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.600]   and it rings of a new peace that is given to the globe.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.480]   We saw that yesterday.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.960]   But it all raises the question,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.040]   how do I enjoy the Christmas peace of God right now,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.960]   personally, in my own heart and in my own life?
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.820]   Today, John Piper explains in a clip
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000]   from his 2011 Christmas sermon
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   explaining Luke chapter two, verse 14.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.960]   Here's what John Piper said.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.840]   - When I say peace,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.320]   I don't simply mean the absence of conflict or animosity.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.840]   I mean the presence of joyful tranquility
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.840]   and as much richness of interpersonal communication
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.020]   as you are capable of.
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.920]   Richness of back and forth,
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.920]   richness and sweetness of back and forth.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.040]   Nothing awkward, nothing tense,
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.280]   nothing subterranean,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.680]   just open, free, sweet,
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.580]   eyeball to eyeball, no agenda, peace.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.200]   That's what we're after.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   So let's look at these.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.440]   Let me start with the key, the key, the key.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.580]   There's more than one.
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.920]   The key to each of these three relationships of peace
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.700]   is keeping together what the angels kept together.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.720]   Glory to God, peace to us, together.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.480]   If you say, I don't have any interest in,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.520]   love for, admiration of,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.360]   treasuring of the glory of God,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.040]   I just want the peace, you won't get it.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.560]   You can't separate the two.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.880]   The angels won't let you.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.260]   God won't let you.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.440]   God's purpose is to give you peace
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.140]   by being the most glorious person in your life.
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.840]   Five times in the New Testament,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.120]   God is called the God of peace.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.000]   Jesus said, "My peace I leave with you.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.120]   "My peace I give to you."
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.840]   And Paul said, "Jesus is our peace."
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.000]   Therefore, if you say, I want the peace,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.840]   I don't want the glorious God,
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   I want the peace, I don't want the sovereign Jesus,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.720]   you won't have the peace.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.480]   He will be our peace by being our God.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.880]   Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.280]   The angels have it right, the angels keep it together.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   If we want peace to rule in our lives,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.000]   God must rule in our lives.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.560]   He is our peace.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.560]   So, the key to peace is glory to God
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   and peace to man kept together.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.760]   A heart bent on showing the glory of God
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.960]   will know the peace of God.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.980]   What holds these two together?
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.720]   A heart that is bent on glorifying God,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.600]   making much of God, displaying the beauty of God,
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.800]   admiring God, treasuring God, cherishing God,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   hallowing God's name, and enjoying tranquility and peace
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.120]   and candor and openness and readiness to forgive
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.480]   and receptive hearts, not pushing people away,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.480]   but welcoming people in, even long lost enemies.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.240]   What keeps those together?
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.460]   Faith, faith, believing the promises of God
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.520]   bought by the blood of Jesus.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.680]   And there's a key text, been so precious in my life.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.080]   I love this text, just a little simple verse
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.680]   from Romans 15, 13.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.440]   "May the God of hope fill you
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.440]   with all joy and peace in believing."
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.020]   I don't think it could be much clearer.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.000]   How will I enjoy joy and peace from the God of hope?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.160]   How will I?
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.800]   What connects me to that God and his peace?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120]   In believing, by believing, through believing
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.840]   the promises bought by the blood of Jesus.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.140]   That will be another key as we look
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.040]   at each of these relationships.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.460]   So here we go, number one, peace with God.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.000]   This peace, this peace right here
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.720]   is foundational to all other peace.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.360]   If you try to make peace with your mind and your heart
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   and all the guilt and anxiety that comes again and again
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.000]   without that peace, and if you try to hold a family together
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.760]   and to make peace at work, you will maybe achieve
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   some brief superficial measures, but it won't last,
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.000]   especially into eternity.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.480]   All peace inwardly and peace outwardly
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.800]   is based on this vertical experience
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.460]   of do I have peace with God?
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.400]   Is it open and clear with God?
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.760]   Are we friends?
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.880]   So the key text, as you might guess where I would go,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.340]   is Romans 5.1.
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.160]   Therefore, since we have been justified by faith,
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.880]   by believing, we have peace with God
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.940]   through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.360]   Having been justified by faith,
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.440]   by believing, trusting him
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.760]   and all of his promises to me, I have peace.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.240]   So just a word on justification again.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   Justification, being justified means
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.520]   God declares you just.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.880]   God declares you right, righteous, pure,
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.320]   perfect, acceptable, acceptable.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.040]   He does, he declares you that.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   How?
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.420]   I'm not.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.800]   No, that's the gospel.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.040]   Through faith, faith in Jesus, the foundation,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.040]   the purchaser, the blood provider of all the promises.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   I believe in Jesus, and when I believe,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   I'm united to Jesus, and what Jesus was,
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   he was for me, and God looks upon his righteousness as mine
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.080]   and his punishment as mine,
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.400]   and therefore, in spite of all my sins,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.120]   God is my friend.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.280]   This is the difference that it makes.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.440]   When Christ comes into the world, dies for our sins,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.320]   provides our perfection, we believe, believe, believe,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   we trust him, God says, justified peace.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.640]   Lots of people come to church on this weekend
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.720]   who don't usually come to church.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.560]   They're not interested necessarily in Christ
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.920]   and Bible and salvation and justification,
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.360]   all these things.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.560]   I just wanna say something really clear
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.080]   after trying to say what that peace with God
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.080]   is through Jesus.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.800]   It's not by our deeds.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's not by our tradition, whether Baptist or Catholic
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.120]   or Lutheran or Methodist or Presbyterian.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.600]   It's not by baptism.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.960]   It's not by church membership.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.140]   It's not by piety.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.480]   It's not by parentage.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.280]   It is by faith alone.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.200]   This is the core of our gospel.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.520]   Christ died in our place.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.920]   Christ provided an alien righteousness for us
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.800]   that is not ours and Christ bore our punishment
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.280]   and he offers it to every single human being
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.840]   and it is received by faith alone.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.400]   And when that faith happens, we are united with him
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.200]   and his righteousness is ours and we have peace with God.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.760]   And there isn't anything sweeter to go to bed on.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.400]   - Amen, that is so good.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.040]   This excerpt was taken from John Piper's Christmas sermon,
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.880]   "A Savior is Born, Glory to God, Peace to Man,"
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.240]   preached on December 24th, 2011.

[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.360]   Again, from all of us at Desiring God,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.160]   we wish you a very joyful Christmas.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.660]   And Pastor John and I will see you on Monday.
