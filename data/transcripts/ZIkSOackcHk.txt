[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Evan writes in to ask Pastor John, "I have a follow-up question from episode number 326.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I have trouble distinguishing the difference between loving God and loving theology,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   or loving God and just loving loving God.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Can you give some practical tips to make sure I am truly loving God
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and not just loving the theology about Him?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Pastor John, how would you make this distinction tangible for Evan?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Well, my first response to Evan is that the fact that you care about that,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   that you even can articulate it that way, is a very good sign,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   and I'm encouraged that God has done enough in your life
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   so that you're not blindly going on loving loving God without really loving God,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   because you know the difference between the two.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   But as I thought about this, at least four practical tests for you and anybody,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   really all of us, to test whether we are just fascinated with theology about God
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   or whether we really love God.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Test number one, is your love for God and your vision of God through the theology
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   changing your life at the practical root?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   What you do, what you love to do, what you're entertained by,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   what your preferences are, the way you treat people, are you patient,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   are you killing sin by the Spirit, are you bearing the fruits of the Spirit?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   In other words, holiness of life is the mark of authentic faith
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   in and through good theology.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You can have a good theology and be a rotten person,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and so it's the person who gets changed by authentic faith through right theology.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   James said, "Faith without works is dead."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And so if we're not being changed from the inside out, then probably we're playing games.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Number two, test number two, do you love to bear witness to the truth of the gospel
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   as good news to people who need it,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   or do you only like to discuss it with people who already know it?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   In other words, the essence of biblical truth is news.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Gospel means news, good news.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And a lot of people seem to never get around to the newsishness of it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   They're always analyzing it, and you want to shake them and say, "Hey, this is news!
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   This is news! The King has come!
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Sins are forgiven! Hell and death and sin are overcome!
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Heaven is open! God is willing to be our friend!
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   There's news in all the worlds!"
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   If you have no inclination to tell anybody that as news, you've got a problem.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I mean, something's deeply, deeply wrong.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   It's as though you're listening to the news at night,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   and you're just analyzing the grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar, grammar,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and you don't ever hear anything coming out of the news that strikes you as either bad or good news.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And Jesus said, "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So we don't want to be around people and have no inclination to speak news into their lives.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   That's number two. Test number two.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Test number three.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Do you take risks with your life for the sake of the gospel?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Your money, your career, your relationships?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   We know what we value by what we take risks for.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Hebrews 10:34, "You joyfully accepted the plundering of your property,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So the test of whether you really love your better possession
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   is whether you're accepting the plundering of your property
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and taking risks to go visit people in prison.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Here's the last test, number four.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   How does your theology serve you when you're suffering or dying?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Ideas about God aren't going to cut it in those moments.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Your fears will slice through that in a minute,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   and you will be terrified that ideas aren't going to save you.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   We show what is at the root of our commitments
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   by how those commitments serve us in suffering.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Paul said, "We were so utterly burdened beyond our strength
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   that we despaired of life itself.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And then he added, "That was to make us rely not on ourselves,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   but on God who raises the dead."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So my question is, test number four,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   when the doctor--interesting, I just got a call today
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   from a doctor following up on the hospitalization I had a while back.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   They did a second CT scan on my belly,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and when I saw the number on the cell phone, I thought, "Okay."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I didn't know whether he'd call or not, and he called,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   and he said, "Not a problem. Clear CT scan."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So now at that moment,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   am I finding that the God who raises the dead
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   is a sweet and all-sufficient rock,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   or am I panicking and realizing I've been playing games all my life?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So I'll just give you a word for each test.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Holiness, news, risk, and suffering.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Those are our four possibilities, Evan, for how you might test yourself.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Evan, for the question.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   If you have a question for Pastor John,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   especially a follow-up from an episode you may have heard in the past,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   please email those questions to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   If you're in the app, you can just send us an email from right there.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Tomorrow we will look at a question from a listener named Josh who asks,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "Can I believe the whole Bible and still not be one of the elect?"
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That's a frightening question,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   but it's a question that's very common in the Ask Pastor John mailbag.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   We'll be back tomorrow to hear Pastor John's answer.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   [end]
