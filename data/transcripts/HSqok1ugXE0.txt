[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.900]   - Who we got for the first one?
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.860]   - The first one is Thomas.
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.740]   And he basically has a question about deep life
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.900]   and how that applies to sales.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.800]   - Nice, all right.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   - Hey Cal, my name is Thomas.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.140]   First, I wanted to say thank you for all that you do.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.940]   Your work has really helped me live a better life.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.300]   Anyways, I work for a software development company
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.060]   and I'm starting my own recruiting agency as well.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.540]   For both companies, my main focus is currently sales
[00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.740]   and business development.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.980]   I'm usually focused on outbound sales work
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.680]   like calling, emailing, and curating
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.500]   and sharing relevant articles with prospects.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.980]   My question is how can I incorporate deep work into my role
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.100]   and how does it apply to sales?
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.360]   Also, how do you see outbound or inbound sales
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900]   for that matter, evolving as buyers continue
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.980]   to be inundated with emails and calls?
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.380]   Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.980]   - Well, Thomas, I mean, I think when it comes
[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.980]   to any work activity, probably the relevant term,
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.860]   and I think you're mixing two similar terms together,
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620]   but I'm gonna separate them.
[00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.720]   Probably the relevant term here is deliberate practice,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460]   maybe even more so than deep work.
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.700]   So deep work, and you can go back
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.220]   and watch my core idea video about this,
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.260]   is an activity, it's an activity where you give something
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.180]   focus without distraction.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.060]   And it's a mental state in which you produce
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.980]   at a high level for your cognitive capacities.
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.860]   I mean, clearly on a sales call, you know this,
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.340]   you wanna be doing just that and you don't wanna be
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.660]   checking your email at the same time.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.020]   But I think what's really relevant here
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.900]   is the related topic of deliberate practice.
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.580]   It's something I write about in my book,
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.160]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You."
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.580]   How do you take this concept and apply it
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.980]   to the really varied and weird and kind of squishy
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.060]   to measure type activities that make up
[00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.580]   typical office style work?
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.780]   And my argument is we should be trying to do these efforts.
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.920]   We should be trying to deliberately improve in the office.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.420]   We should be applying deliberate practice,
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.400]   which means we have to design activities specifically
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.260]   to stretch our ability beyond where we're comfortable,
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.080]   using feedback to help keep us aimed in the right place.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.820]   And in that stretch, we get better and better.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.100]   That's probably the key thing for sales.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.540]   It's continually saying, what are the key skills here?
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.420]   What makes a better sales call versus a worse one?
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.500]   And designing activities to stretch your abilities,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.380]   getting feedback to make sure that you're aimed
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.260]   in the right direction.
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.880]   And this might be something you do with mentors.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.680]   This might be something you do with studies or courses,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.700]   but there's a lot of improvement to be done here
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.220]   and what really works and what doesn't
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.980]   in the type of sales that you do.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980]   And you should have the mindset of,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.460]   I wanna get better at this in a month than I am right now.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.700]   And I'm not gonna be better in a month
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.020]   just by doing a lot more calls.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.940]   I'm gonna get better by doing a lot more
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.100]   deliberately structured activities that stretch me
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.860]   in the places where I am not yet good, or I could be better.
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.020]   So you gotta get in the information about what matters here
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.060]   to design activities to stretch you.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.660]   That's how you get better and better.
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.860]   Once you have that mindset,
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.820]   the issue of the mediums changing,
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.560]   people aren't listening to emails as much,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.500]   people are more inundated with distractions,
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.120]   or how do we sell better?
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.620]   You're gonna react to that naturally
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.260]   because you're already gonna be in this mindset
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.620]   of trying to figure out what works
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.180]   and stretching yourself towards what's better.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.260]   Getting back metrics, seeing what works, what doesn't,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.500]   moving towards the things that do.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.900]   So you'll already be in that mindset.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.500]   So you'll already be shifting away from the trouble areas
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.900]   and towards the new modalities that work better.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.300]   So that's what I would suggest.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.540]   This is a deliberate practice play.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   You wanna train at sales calls like an athlete training
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.620]   to pick up a new type of shot,
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.400]   like an athlete trying to get an accuracy higher.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.700]   You wanna train like a chess player
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.340]   trying to master a new type of opening,
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.900]   deliberately structured work.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.660]   And we do this not just for success, for the sake of success.
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.500]   We do this because it makes you better than you were,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.060]   which gives you more career capital.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.940]   And with that career capital,
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.360]   you get more flexibility and autonomy over your working life,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.820]   which is ultimately the whole game here
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.860]   is get that capital, gain control of your working life,
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.020]   move it towards what resonates and away from what doesn't.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.980]   All that's built on skill.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.360]   The skill comes from practice.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.580]   So that is the term, Thomas, I want you to have in mind
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.260]   is deliberate practice, not necessarily deep work.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.900]   (upbeat music)
