[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   That's today's deep question.
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.260]   The deep question we're gonna explore today,
[00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.360]   how can I significantly decrease the footprint
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   of my remote job without anyone noticing?
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.880]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.840]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.440]   in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.400]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.900]   joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.400]   Jesse, we're coming up to a milestone,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   a random milestone for the show, but one nonetheless.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.320]   10 million downloads.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.680]   Really? Yeah.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.920]   Wow.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   We'll be there in a month or so.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.840]   That's a lot.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.840]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.980]   these numbers are kind of arbitrary,
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.960]   but as someone who was on my publishing team,
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.640]   they needed updated numbers for internal whatever,
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.920]   'cause my book, and I was sitting along the numbers,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.300]   and they said, "That's a lot of zeros."
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840]   So we're adding, we're about to add a new zero
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.820]   to our list of downloads.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.660]   Wow.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.360]   Little known fact,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.900]   podcasts monetize at about $10 per download,
[00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.040]   so we've made $100 million off of this show.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   That's how it works.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.700]   Oh, well.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.160]   Anyways, I saw something.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.760]   I saw something in the newspaper recently
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.840]   that was doing what we could think of as a reality check
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.760]   on some predictions I've been making,
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.920]   and I think it's good for us to hold ourselves accountable,
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.520]   so I wanted to load this up real quick.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.320]   I saw this in my hometown paper, "The Washington Post,"
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.240]   and this was, I don't know, a week or two ago
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   that I saw this.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.000]   I've loaded it on the screen,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.640]   so if you're watching this at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.720]   this is episode 236, you'll see this on the screen,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.880]   but I'll narrate it for those who are listening.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   It was a cover article, actually, in the paper version,
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.440]   the business section of the paper version of the paper,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.280]   and the headline is,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.960]   "America's offices are now half full.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.320]   They may not get much fuller."
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.560]   It's based off new data about office occupancy,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.660]   and then they talk to some experts
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.860]   about what they think this means and what's gonna come.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.320]   This is a good chance to hold myself accountable,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.360]   so starting in May of 2020,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.640]   I began making predictions
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.320]   about what I thought was gonna happen with remote work,
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.960]   and the trajectory of my predictions was twofold.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.680]   Early in the pandemic, in May of 2020,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.160]   I had one prediction that I then refined as time went on,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   and my refined prediction,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.480]   which I talked about for about a year or a year and a half,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   was that as the acute phase of the pandemic wound down,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   remote work was gonna reduce significantly.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.520]   In the, I called it five to 10-year window,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.800]   but probably not 10, maybe a five to seven-year window,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.440]   we were gonna see returns aggressively
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   towards pre-pandemic in-person work,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.560]   and then I had a more speculative prediction
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320]   that that was then gonna shift again,
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.800]   maybe seven to 10 years in the future,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.960]   where we were gonna see a new breed of company
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.760]   that was native remote,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.300]   using ideas that were spawned by companies
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.480]   that innovated during the pandemic,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.680]   these were gonna start to rise
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   and spread new methods of remote work,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.520]   and we were gonna see a return back towards remote work,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.240]   so it's gonna be a up the remote high,
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.600]   back down towards in-person,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.640]   and then a sort of slow gradual shift
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.160]   towards a more advanced and sophisticated approach
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.920]   to remote work in the future.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.400]   So I had this whole theory about it,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.080]   I wrote an article in "The New Yorker" about it
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840]   a year or so ago,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.400]   where I espoused this theory that was first proposed
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.800]   by an entrepreneur named Chris Hurd, H-E-R-D,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   this theory about tech companies
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.160]   that started during 2020 and 2021,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.600]   were gonna figure out from scratch
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   how to be remote really well,
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.000]   and it would take about five to 10 years
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.320]   for those ideas to spread to other industries
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   and larger companies,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.440]   and then we're gonna see really stable remote companies,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.560]   but in the short term,
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.640]   my prediction was we're so bad at remote work
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.320]   because we let the hyperactive hive mind
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   rule our collaboration strategy,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.360]   and when you take a hyperactive hive mind controlled company
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.680]   and makes it remote, a lot of friction arises,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.960]   and people work more,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.000]   and they're in Zoom all day,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.160]   and email goes out of control,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.680]   that we were gonna end up having to stumble back
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   to in-person work.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.140]   All right, so we can look at the data,
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.760]   how would we grade my prediction?
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.600]   Where are we now?
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.320]   About maybe a year to two years out,
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.120]   depending on what timeline we're going on
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   for when I first started making these predictions,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.540]   and according to this research here,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.440]   the office occupancy has hit a post-pandemic milestone
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.680]   of 50%.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.360]   This, I guess this would have been in January.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   All right, so that is a non-trivial return
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.400]   towards in-person work, like I predicted.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.320]   However, according to this article,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   experts say this could be the new normal.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.260]   So in other words,
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.820]   the experts cited in this Washington Post article say,
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.960]   "But we're not gonna get higher than this."
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.920]   Got two points here.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.640]   One, if they are correct about that,
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.760]   I would give myself maybe a B.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.500]   I don't know what you think is fair here, Jesse.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.740]   We did for sure return significantly towards remote work.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.520]   I think this number was down in the 30s
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   at their nadir in the summer of 2020.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.840]   And so we've gone back to more than half of them.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.200]   So we could say the majority of companies are now in person,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.760]   but we're not 80%, we're not 90%,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.400]   which is the numbers pre-pandemic were very high.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   There was not as much remote work going on.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.780]   So I would maybe give myself a B
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.320]   if these numbers were accurate.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   My second point,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.840]   I don't know that that prediction is accurate.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.500]   So I have a graph on the screen here
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.660]   from the article.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.960]   It looks like, okay, I was wrong.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.560]   The nadir was actually,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.960]   looks here like 15% in person.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.000]   And this would have been in 2020, the spring of 2020.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.400]   It looks like it's been raising pretty steadily.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.720]   And there's a pretty steady line raising
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.580]   this 50% higher than any other time before.
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.900]   I think these experts might be a little bit too quick
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.580]   to say this may be the new normal.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.720]   And I believe it's probably from bias.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   I think for certain sectors of our economy right now,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.900]   especially those who are involved
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.500]   in sort of elite discourses, elite media discourses,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.380]   or elite academic discourses,
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.160]   an idea took hold in the last year or so
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.800]   that remote work was a progressive labor policy
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.700]   and was in some sense,
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.880]   the only humane way to run knowledge work.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.980]   And the very idea that someone would want
[00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.900]   to run their office in the way
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.340]   that we've been running offices basically until yesterday.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.660]   So for decades and decades of yesterday,
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.400]   the very idea that we'd want to do that again
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.760]   is itself contemptible.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.180]   So there's this strain of thought
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.100]   that has now associated remote work
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.880]   with this is obviously the thing that we should be doing
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.620]   and is almost aghast, if not completely flabbergasted
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.180]   that anyone would not just let their employees
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.060]   be fully remote.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.260]   So I think from that mindset,
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.100]   which by the way, I'm not fully dismissing.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.820]   I wrote this whole New Yorker piece
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220]   that tried to understand where that came from.
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.340]   And I think there's deeper layers
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.420]   underneath supporting that,
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.420]   that are worth unpacking that we won't do that now.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.940]   But if that is your mindset
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.240]   and that's what you're seeing on Twitter,
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.940]   and that's the conversation you see in the Washington Post
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.760]   every time you open it up or in the New York Times,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.260]   if that is your mindset,
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.300]   I think it's hard to believe
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.340]   that the number would keep going up.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.980]   You're surprised it's even at 50.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.900]   So you say, well, surely it would go no higher than this.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.780]   And this is essentially what the expert quotes,
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.940]   at least by my ear, is what it sounds like in here.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.600]   It's not like there is evidence for a significant slowdown
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.980]   and we're reaching a derivative of zero now on this graph.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.540]   If you look at what's going on here,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.820]   the experts are just saying things like,
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   it's unlikely to go much higher
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.500]   because flexible work is becoming entrenched.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.340]   Some employees have resisted hard mandates.
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.300]   It's just sort of, hey, we're used to this now.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.340]   I can't imagine it's gonna go higher.
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.720]   So I don't know, the reality I bet
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.060]   is probably higher than that,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.360]   but still probably not as high as I predicted.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.740]   So we can put aside whether that's good or bad.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.680]   I've tried to take a relatively value agnostic stance
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.240]   in my predictions.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.920]   So when I'm trying to predict what I think is happening,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.640]   I just wanna try to get it right.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.080]   Whether it's good or bad, what's gonna happen,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.560]   that's a separate strain of argument,
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.980]   which I have other thoughts on.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.020]   But I think we have a little bit more in person
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.940]   to go going forward.
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.040]   And again, my argument for why that is the case,
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.720]   and I'll just take this one piece of my argument
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.540]   and rearticulate it one more time.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.040]   If you do not have good processes
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.640]   or systems for collaboration,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.240]   if you rely on ad hoc unscheduling back and forth
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.440]   interactions to get things done,
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   remote work makes work harder.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   You get rid of the incredibly efficient
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.780]   impromptu let me grab you after a meeting
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.080]   or in a hallway type discussions.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.060]   You lose transparency in the people's workload
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.760]   or evident exhaustion.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.360]   You break down the boundaries much more severely
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.960]   between at work and not at work.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.000]   You get rid of that commute time,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.160]   psychological phase shift that helps you shift
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.240]   from work to at home, increasing burnout, increasing stress.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.840]   A lot of remote knowledge workers are not working less.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   If anything, they're working more,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.200]   even though there's less physical surveillance
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.840]   and they don't have to spend time to commute.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.680]   So there's a lot of issues
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.440]   with just taking bad collaborations styles
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.920]   and then moving them remote.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.360]   And so my prediction is that friction
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.640]   was gonna bring people back
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.400]   because it just works a little bit better.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.600]   That doesn't mean remote work is not a good idea,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.360]   but it has to be done with much more structure and strategy.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.640]   And that's what I think is gonna arise
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.680]   five, six years in the future.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.040]   That's being worked out now
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.360]   and this sort of remote work V2,
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   that is gonna have it spread.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.760]   It's gonna be a little more gradual
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.320]   and we'll have a much more sophisticated approach
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.720]   to remote work than simply just do what you were doing,
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.880]   but now we're on Zoom a lot.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.920]   So that was my thoughts on that.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.040]   And I think I'm, according to this article,
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.080]   have a B, if trends continue the way I think they might,
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.920]   maybe I'll edge myself up to a B plus.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.760]   So we'll see.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.040]   But I wanted to take advantage of this topic
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.120]   and say, putting aside what's gonna happen in the future,
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.960]   let's talk about what we can do
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.960]   with what we have right now.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.520]   So if you were one of the 50% or more of knowledge workers
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.320]   who is working remote right now,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.160]   let's take this reality out for a little bit of a spin.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   I mean, what are we experts on here in this show?
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.800]   One of the things we're expert on
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.400]   is really understanding how work unfolds
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.040]   and then building very intentional or intelligent systems
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.160]   to allow us to take advantage of these realities,
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   to take control of our work and our workloads
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.400]   and how things unfold.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   Working remotely in theory
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.920]   massively increases your flexibility and autonomy
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.040]   if you're able to take advantage of that.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.360]   And so I figured, let's look into that a little bit.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.840]   Let's look into how we can hack a remote work job
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.840]   with the goal of significantly decreasing
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.720]   the amount of time you work.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.800]   So that's today's deep question.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.000]   The deep question we're gonna explore today,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.080]   how can I significantly decrease the footprint
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.080]   of my remote job without anyone noticing?
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.240]   So like always, we'll deep dive on that question.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.520]   Then in the second segment of the show,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.440]   we're gonna do five questions from you, my listeners,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.360]   that all relate to this general topic of today's episode.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.000]   And then the third segment, we'll do something different.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.880]   And today that's gonna be me reviewing
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.480]   the five books I read last month.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560]   All right, so that's our goal.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.800]   You know, Jesse, I'm not the first to do this.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.640]   This was at the key of Tim Ferriss' "4-Hour Workweek,"
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.360]   2007 bestseller.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.240]   "4-Hour Workweek" gets into
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.680]   how do you shift your job to remote?
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.960]   And then once you're remote,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.920]   how do you best take advantage
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.840]   of the potential flexibility there
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.240]   to build something really cool?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.520]   And I think what Tim was right about,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.200]   and this is influencing what I'm talking about today,
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.760]   is that it's actually non-trivial
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.880]   to take advantage of that potential.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.680]   It's not just because my job is remote,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.000]   suddenly I'll have more flexibility,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.040]   autonomy, and things will be better.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.640]   It's actually hard work to take advantage
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.200]   of the potential for the remoteness to make your job better.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   So in some sense, we're upgrading Tim's original thoughts
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.680]   from 2007 to the reality of 2023 knowledge work.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.480]   All right, so I have two points to make
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.760]   before we get into our tactics here.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.800]   Point number one, what do I mean
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.040]   when I say significantly decrease
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.680]   the footprint of your remote job?
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.920]   Here's the definition I wanna use
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.040]   for the sake of today's discussion,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.440]   that you've reduced the time you spend
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.240]   on your remote job enough that you could, in theory,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.600]   fit a significant second endeavor
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.260]   into your standard work hours.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.480]   Right, so that's what we mean by significantly decrease.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.040]   What are examples of the type of significant second endeavors
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.840]   that you could put in?
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.120]   Well, there's always what we've talked about
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.600]   on the show before, the phantom part-time job.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.080]   This is where you're essentially working on something else
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.840]   at the same time that you have your normal job.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.120]   You have some side hustle
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.240]   that you're putting some time into.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.360]   Now, we've gotten feedback on this before
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.920]   that in a lot of professions,
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.440]   there's some ethical issues around that.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   But for a just in case, or for instance,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.880]   I think this is a good example of the magnitude of time
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.920]   we're talking about saving here,
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.680]   that significant, significant second endeavor
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.760]   could be a personal pursuit,
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.020]   something very important that you're doing in your own life
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.220]   that is non-professional.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:32.580]   So you are rich role style while he was still a lawyer
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.560]   and training to do his Iron Man endurance events, right?
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.560]   Or you're building a massive animatronic Halloween display
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.760]   that's going to move and walk down the street
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.640]   just bringing this up from a friend.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.600]   That's definitely not my intention,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.520]   but something that takes a lot of time.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.400]   I've seen some of these guys on YouTube.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.080]   It could also be just, you want a lot of cushion
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.240]   because the pandemic was exhausting and you have young kids
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.160]   and you just wanna be able to like Ginny Odell,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.480]   just sit outside in a garden for a couple hours
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.580]   on a semi-regular basis,
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.440]   because we don't have to be pushing it to the limit
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.480]   all the time that exhausts us as humans.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.040]   It could even be mastering a new skill
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.920]   that is relevant to your current job.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.500]   What I'm gonna do is free up a lot of time,
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.560]   which I'm gonna use to master the skill
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   that if I bring it to my current job,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.660]   then I'm gonna be really killing it, right?
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.480]   I am going to learn this advanced machine learning,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.120]   modeling language and come back with the ability
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.720]   to completely overhaul the way
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.760]   our client recommendation systems work.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.320]   So this is gonna take me months of study
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.680]   and it's gonna take a lot of time and I can do it
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   because I freed up a significant amount of time.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.920]   So that's what I mean, that's the goal.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.680]   That's how much time I wanna talk about freeing up here.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.920]   Point two, this is not quiet quitting.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.680]   Quiet quitting reduces the time
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.880]   and the amount of things you get done.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.720]   It reduces the time you spend working by disengagement.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.920]   It says, you know what?
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.560]   I'm working too hard and so I'm gonna work less hard
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.000]   because I don't owe you work that's hard.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.440]   I don't owe you that magnitude of hard work.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.120]   So quiet quitting is you pulling back essentially
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.600]   what it is you're offering to your employer.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.340]   As you'll see with the advice I wanna give,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.520]   this is actually quite different.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.080]   We're gonna be squeezing out inefficiencies.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.800]   We're gonna be squeezing out wasted time.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.020]   Time waste that was injected into your life
[00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.280]   because of the negative externalities of remote work
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.720]   that when you reclaim that back,
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.960]   you're not actually reducing the amount of useful work
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.540]   you're able to do for your employee.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.920]   You're just reducing the amount of time
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.480]   that same good work requires.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.400]   So this is not about you saying, wait a second,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.080]   I'm giving you too much.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.560]   I'm now gonna do less.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.880]   You know, what are you gonna do about it?
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.680]   It is, we are doing this poorly.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.200]   If I get rid of the wastage,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.400]   I'm still getting the same work done, but I'm done at two.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.520]   So I'm gonna build a giant animatronic Halloween display
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.240]   outside of my house.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.280]   All right, so those are my two points.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.560]   All right, so given those two caveats,
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.720]   I have a collection of ideas here.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.720]   Let me look at my notes, five ideas.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.840]   If you're a remote worker,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.560]   how to significantly decrease the footprint
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.380]   of your remote job without anyone noticing.
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:26.300]   All right, idea number one, create synchrony traps.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.000]   Now this is new terminology for an idea
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.920]   that you hear in different forms all the time in this show,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.560]   but it is a critical idea nonetheless.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.960]   Your number one enemy
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.200]   to significantly decreasing your time
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.280]   is the need to have to monitor back and forth communication
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.560]   throughout all your business hours.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.760]   So if the way your collaboration unfolds
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.580]   is through back and forth Slack and email,
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.080]   it is very difficult, for example,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.560]   for you to stop work at two
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.200]   to go work on your giant animatronics
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.300]   because there's all of these ongoing conversations
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.060]   that you keep having to dip back into.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.080]   In fact, you probably have to keep dipping back
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.540]   into those beyond normal work hours and into the weekend.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.780]   So we have to kill as much as possible
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.680]   the need to have these unscheduled
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.900]   back and forth conversations
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.440]   at the core of your collaboration.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   You need to defer these asynchronous conversations
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.100]   to easy to access synchrony.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.360]   A few ideas I've mentioned before,
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.260]   number one, office hours.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.320]   You know I'm a huge advocate of this.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.200]   Every day this hour, my phone is on, Zoom is on,
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.040]   I monitor this very specific Slack channel.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.160]   It's like my name, office hours.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.720]   And you just tell people as soon as an email
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.560]   or a conversation looks like it's about to instigate
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.240]   a long back and forth discussion
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.200]   that's just gonna happen asynchronously and haphazardly,
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.480]   you say, let's get into this.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.000]   Any one of my upcoming office hours,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.080]   just swing by, shoot me a call, jump on Zoom,
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.880]   and we'll go back and forth and figure this out.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.640]   You could probably defer 50%
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.680]   of what would otherwise be ongoing asynchronous conversations.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.880]   50% you could defer to these pre-scheduled office hours
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.720]   and dispatch with them.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.080]   And again, if we wanna clear up a lot of time,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.720]   we have to concentrate when this interaction happens.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.240]   Standing group meetings is also important.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.440]   This is an idea that's adapted from agile methodologies
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.880]   where they have this standing meeting every single morning.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.240]   You don't need that, but if you work in a team or a group,
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.120]   have twice a week, a standing meeting, one hour long,
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.600]   where you deal with all your group issues,
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.160]   and you should have a shared document
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.960]   where people write down as it occurs to them,
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.160]   things that need to be discussed,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.760]   decisions that need to be made,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.120]   questions that need to be answered.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.760]   They write it into the shared doc.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.720]   And when you get to your next standing group meeting,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.120]   you just go through that thing.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.920]   All right, I wanna ask you about this, and what about this?
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.800]   And what are we doing about this?
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:49.680]   Can we check in on this?
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.600]   And I'm worried about that, and what happened to this report?
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.680]   And who's working on this, and what do you need?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.120]   And everything gets taken care of.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.400]   That's like another 30% of your otherwise
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.720]   asynchronous haphazard back and forth email conversations.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.760]   Another 30% are out of your inbox,
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.280]   out of your chat channels,
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.960]   if you have a standing group meeting twice a week.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.600]   Finally, ad hoc processes.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   This is the core idea in my book, "A World Without Email."
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.760]   Collaboration happens on a regular basis.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.640]   You should have a process that everyone agrees on,
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.520]   and everyone will have a part in constructing
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.960]   that explains how information moves,
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.320]   and how you communicate,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.640]   and prevents you from having to have unscheduled messages.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.880]   So if something happens a lot,
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.200]   you eventually have to bite the bullet,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.560]   and figure out that system
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.120]   where there's a shared spreadsheet,
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.640]   and you update the cell when you've updated the file,
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.320]   and the file goes into Google Drive somewhere,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.120]   and on Wednesdays is when the designer takes the file,
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.040]   and edits it, and whatever.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.080]   You figure out those processes that prevent you
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.600]   from having to wait until a message comes in,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.160]   and then send a response.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.120]   So synchrony traps, critical.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.480]   All right, idea number two.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.240]   Control your meeting availability.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.640]   You are still, in most knowledge work jobs,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.440]   even after you put in place sufficient quantity
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.160]   of synchrony traps, are gonna have one-off meetings.
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.480]   Hey, we need to talk about this new initiative.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.400]   This client wants to have a conversation.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.840]   Your boss needs to go over the new marketing request.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.400]   I mean, these one-off meetings are, of course, unavoidable.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   If they can just metastasize all over your schedule,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.000]   all over the place, that is the other major killer
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.020]   of the ability to reduce the footprint of your job.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.260]   You'll wanna leave at two to work on those animatronics,
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.180]   but there's always that stupid three o'clock meeting
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.020]   that shows up.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.160]   So we have to control the meetings,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.140]   but we have to do so in a way that does not make you seem
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.000]   like a time miser or a curmudgeon,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.160]   because that just annoys people,
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   and then they're gonna throw more meetings at you
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.000]   just because you're on their nerves.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.880]   So how do we do this?
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.640]   How do we control when our meetings happen
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.980]   without being annoying?
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   You become overly helpful in setting up meetings.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.840]   You have a scheduling system that's incredibly easy to use,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.880]   and all of your availabilities are in it,
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.280]   and you just have to click a button,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.860]   and you're good to go.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.840]   That meeting, you'll be there.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.080]   That meeting is booked.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.640]   And you act incredibly felicitous when people ask you,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.480]   like, "Hey, can we do a meeting?"
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.320]   You're like, "Of course.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.840]   In fact, I have all of my availabilities in this system."
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.600]   You just, any time that works for you,
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.680]   you just click on whenever it's gonna work best for you.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.040]   And if you need to coordinate with Bob,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.400]   you guys just pick any of these things.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.640]   I'm open all these times.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.200]   I wanna, let's definitely meet.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   I've got the best system.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.080]   I'm Mr. Bring me to a meeting.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.240]   Here's the thing, though.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.600]   You control, then, what those available times are
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.920]   from the outset.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.840]   So then you seed this meeting system
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:49.500]   to keep major swaths of your day protected from meetings.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.040]   Now, what you have to do, and here's the stealthness,
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.320]   if you're too consistent,
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.680]   if it doesn't look sufficiently random,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.720]   it will attract a red flag.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.440]   So if you say, and this is a simple rule,
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.120]   meetings until one, no meetings after one,
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.320]   because I'm training for my marathon
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.240]   or building my Halloween animatronic,
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.260]   that's too noticeable of a pattern.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.040]   So now I'm your boss.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.360]   I'm always suspicious people are trying
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.840]   to pull one over on me.
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.600]   And you say, "Oh yeah, please, I'd love to meet you.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.440]   Pick a time."
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.560]   You say, "Wait a second.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.320]   Every single afternoon has no times.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.720]   I call shenanigans.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.120]   I am in meetings in the afternoon.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.180]   You should be too, you know, what is this?"
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.200]   So what you do is you take two days and you flip it.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.820]   So maybe Monday, Wednesday, Fridays,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.680]   you only show availabilities in the morning.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.020]   Tuesday, Thursdays, you show availabilities
[00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.180]   mainly in the afternoon.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.020]   You throw a rogue meeting here and there.
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.880]   Maybe on a morning where you're not scheduling meetings,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.500]   you throw a rogue one kind of later in the morning.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.120]   That looks sufficiently random that it's,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.000]   "Hey, this guy's got a lot of availability
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.320]   and there's no particular pattern here."
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.880]   But you are absolutely controlling it.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.360]   So by taking control of getting out in front of,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.440]   "I wanna schedule this.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.280]   I love it.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.100]   Let's meet.
[00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.800]   I love meetings, you know, and here's all my availability.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.200]   I'll just show you for the next month."
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.720]   And you just choose all the times you want.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.840]   It actually gives you, ironically,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.400]   allows you to way reduce the impact of meetings
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.120]   if you make it easier to schedule one with you.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.000]   All right, idea number three,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.840]   you really have to sell processes.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.320]   So we mentioned this in the synchrony trap
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.960]   that any type of collaborative work you do regularly
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.480]   should have some sort of system or process in place.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.640]   Well, idea three says you should really focus
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.120]   on selling this to the people you work with.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.840]   It is easier to just rock and roll on email and Slack.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.880]   In the moment, that is always easier
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.680]   because if I just type this nonsense,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.240]   ambiguous soup of email annoyance and hit send,
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.000]   this may be injecting, you know,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.280]   a syringe full of headache into everyone else's life
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.720]   for the next week, but in the moment,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.600]   it gets the thing off my plate.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's out of my mind.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.440]   You know, it's, "Uh, client bad meeting.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.360]   No good thoughts, question mark, lol, emoticon, send."
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   And like that thing is out of my head,
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.680]   even though I've just created a huge headache
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.520]   for everyone else.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.360]   'Cause like, I don't know what to do with this.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.120]   I mean, are we gonna do a meeting?
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.960]   When are we gonna do a meeting?
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.040]   What's the actual issue?
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.200]   And so it's always easier for everyone in the moment
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.720]   to just, let's just rock and roll on Slack, come on.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.040]   So you have to sell processes as an alternative.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.600]   You gotta get buy-in from people.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.800]   Let's work on this together.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.640]   Here's what I think.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.840]   If we use the shared doc and agree that Wednesday nights
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   is when we review the documents, whatever.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.520]   You gotta get buy-in from everyone involved.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   Make it seem like they were a part of that process.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.160]   Do not just come in and say, "This is what we're doing now.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.640]   This would be better."
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.200]   Don't brandish my book and just say, you know,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.080]   "Father Cowell says that we should use Trello."
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.520]   Get buy-in.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.280]   That's part of selling processes.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.240]   Two, offer escape valves.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.400]   Psychology 101.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.320]   People are worried about processes that move them away
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.720]   from the hyperactive hive mind
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.560]   because they will come up with scenarios.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.640]   Hey, we have this system now where we process client requests
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.520]   on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   But what if a request comes in on a client on Monday
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.800]   that says, you know, "I'm being held hostage by a terrorist
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.040]   that has surrounded the local orphanage with a bomb
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.160]   and will explode it unless within the next hour
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.600]   we get responses to this doodle pool."
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.040]   And they're really worried about these scenarios.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.160]   And if we have to wait till Tuesday,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.080]   the orphanage blows up and all the kids die.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.200]   So what you do is you say, "Yeah, but we have an escape valve.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.240]   Here's my number. It's my cell number.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.040]   It's with me all the time."
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.760]   You just call that if there's something that we can't --
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.040]   we have to get out of the process.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.640]   Something is urgent. We gotta get out of here.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.520]   You just call that number and I'll answer it.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.960]   You don't have to worry. We will save those kids.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.880]   They will never call it.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.280]   No one wants to call, like,
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.600]   "I'll just wait till the next meeting."
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.240]   But it gives psychological cover.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.000]   Even if something bad happens,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.800]   this process won't force us into an unforced error.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.400]   So escape valves are a great part of selling processes.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.120]   So you don't just need alternatives
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.960]   to the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.760]   You got to put in a lot of effort
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.240]   to sell them to the people around you,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.800]   the people who are going to use them with you.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.960]   All right, idea four,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.880]   trade accountability for accessibility.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.200]   All right, so this is where
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.120]   you are essentially making a trade,
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.280]   and it's not a costless trade.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.440]   There's some risk here.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.720]   But you're making a trade with your employer
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.360]   where you say, "I'm going to work on this important thing.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.160]   My success or failure on this effort
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.600]   is going to be easy to measure.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.040]   So if I fail, you know it, and we'll have a problem.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   But if I succeed, it'll be good.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.960]   And so I will be accountable for this,
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.200]   but you're going to have to give up some accessibility.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.040]   I'm going away to work on this big, important thing.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   And if I fail at it,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.000]   then maybe I'm going to have some issues at this job.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.640]   But as long as I'm succeeding,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.400]   you're going to let me go off and do this thing."
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.120]   So one of the nice things about the alternative
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.920]   of just being plugged into the hyperactive hive mind
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.760]   is you don't really have that accountability.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.360]   You have the sense of stability.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.320]   As long as you're willing to just,
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.720]   I'm in here, I'm jumping on Zoom, I'm doing doodle polls,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   I'm answering emails in Slack,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.640]   and it just seems like, look, Cal is here, he's busy,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.200]   he's always involved in things.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.920]   So I guess he's doing fine.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.120]   Like your job feels secure.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.320]   When you instead say, "I'm going to give that all up,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.520]   but hold me accountable
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.240]   on actually producing something that sells,"
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   you're leaving the obfuscating comfort of the hyperactivity
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.600]   to make you and your activity very clear.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.280]   And you're trading that.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.520]   You're trading the risk involved in that
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.520]   for less accessibility.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.680]   So a couple advanced tips
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.120]   about how you trade accountability for accessibility.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.360]   This is often a good parry of a potential promotion.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.040]   So if you've been doing really well,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.960]   maybe you've read my book, "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.200]   and you're deliberately practicing
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.000]   and building up career capital.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.840]   If you've been doing really well and like,
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.960]   "Look, we want to promote you.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.600]   Like, you're killing it."
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.200]   That's a great time to parry into an accountability play.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.600]   You say, "Actually, I don't want to move up
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.680]   to the next level and put up to three people
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.520]   working under you."
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.520]   That's an OfficeSpace reference
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.600]   for those who recognize the movie.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.200]   You don't want to move up and have more responsibility,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.920]   but you do want to get some return
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.200]   off of this career capital that you've acquired.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.360]   This is a great parry.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.440]   No, I don't want to take that next management role.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.640]   What I want to do instead is really focus my attention
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   on this type of work that we do,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.080]   and we'll set up a one-on-one relationship
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.480]   with one particular supervisor.
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.360]   I'll check in every week,
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.320]   and here's how it's going to happen.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   And you've just freed yourself from the normal flow
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.520]   of seven different projects
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.080]   and all the different meetings and communication
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.840]   that comes with it.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.480]   Another advanced tip ties extra salary to performance.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.880]   So it's a way of saying,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.640]   "If I do really well, I get paid better."
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.640]   That's a better way for your salary to go up
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.840]   in some circumstances than instead just, again,
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.640]   doing a generic promotion where you have to,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.680]   I have to work up this ladder and have the salary increase
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   with the hyperactivity of my life.
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.520]   Instead, you say, "If I kill it, I'll kill it in my salary.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.520]   And if I don't, I might have a tough year."
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.360]   People like that.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.080]   They feel like skin's in the game.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   Somehow from the employer's perspective,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.600]   risk seems mitigated.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.480]   Advanced tip number three,
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.280]   you might even consider the management consultant schedule.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.040]   So the management consultant schedule
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.640]   is typically you're on site Monday to Thursday,
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.880]   and then you're back at the mothership office on Fridays.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.800]   That's what if you work at McKinsey, for example,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.820]   is what your schedule's often like.
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.360]   If you've made one of these plays,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.300]   I want to trade accountability for accessibility,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.840]   this could be part of what you offer.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.480]   On Fridays, I'll be around at the office.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.080]   Any type of meetings that need to happen
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.960]   that might be tangentially relevant,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.160]   like we can do them on Fridays,
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.760]   you can come chat with me in my office.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.880]   I'll be there on Fridays.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.000]   But Monday through Thursdays, don't really expect much.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.560]   I'm working on whatever,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.360]   building out the new marketing engine
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.600]   for our Halloween animatronics.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.960]   Leave me alone, but I'll be here on Friday.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.440]   So you might even suggest a very specific schedule
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.680]   of accessibility, make that all really plain.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.380]   All right, now idea number five
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.900]   for significantly decreasing the footprint
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.040]   of your remote work job, crush one thing per month.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:16.100]   Systematic, deliberate, relentless, deep work day after day,
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.860]   maybe just one or two hours a day
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.360]   on something really valuable.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.420]   So on a regular basis,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.900]   you're actually producing something great.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.620]   Why is this important for gaining more time?
[00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.060]   Because you get so much breathing room.
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.420]   They give you so much rope to work with
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.580]   when you're crushing it.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.580]   When you're producing really great stuff,
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.820]   you gain much more autonomy over how your job unfolds.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.300]   If you're, by contrast, unreliable,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.700]   if things fall through the cracks
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.160]   when they hand them to you,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.740]   if you haven't really done anything of note
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.340]   in the last two or three years,
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.080]   you're under suspicion,
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.340]   and the leash is gonna be tightened.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.500]   And every time you're late answering an email,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.660]   every time you go an afternoon
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.500]   without them hearing from you,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.100]   they get more and more worried and suspicious.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.020]   And what is this guy doing?
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.060]   Is he building animatronics?
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.940]   What's happening here?
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.180]   But if you're crushing it every month,
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.540]   they're like, this is great, Cal's on it.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.820]   So ironically, by working harder,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.020]   at least on one project a month
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.320]   and giving intense attention,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.660]   you can actually reduce the total amount of time
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.100]   you have to work.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.980]   My friend Adam Grant,
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.620]   the Wharton professor and business author,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.500]   calls these idiosyncrasy credits.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.100]   If you do things really well,
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   you gain the ability to be more idiosyncratic
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.860]   about how you work.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.740]   If you're not doing things really well,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.020]   you lose those credits.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.460]   And so if I'm super valuable,
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.900]   and I wanna focus on just one area
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.340]   and only come in on Fridays
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.540]   and have these weird processes
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.060]   for the few other things we do,
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.820]   if I'm killing it, like whatever.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.380]   If I'm not, you say, yeah, right.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.100]   So you kinda earn your way,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.060]   you'll work your way into working less.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.420]   Now, I think the issue people often have here
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.300]   is they do the first part,
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.900]   they work really hard and do the really good things,
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.060]   but instead of using that as leverage
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.260]   to take control of their career
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.500]   and shape it towards what resonates for their full life,
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.460]   they just say, great, now I'll work even harder.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.820]   Well, this will give me the next promotion
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.860]   and now I'll have to do even more hard work.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.220]   And they just ratchet up, ratchet up
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:13.340]   until they're completely burned out.
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.220]   So you can't forget that second part.
[00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.460]   Once you do something really good,
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.380]   become so good you can't be ignored,
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:19.940]   you gotta take that out for a spin
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.340]   and say, what do I want?
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.860]   Not just what more will this earn me?
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.420]   How much more money can I make?
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.020]   How much more prestige can I gain in just being promoted?
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.860]   You need a much broader view,
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.100]   not when things are going bad,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.660]   but when things are going well.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.660]   I think that's something that people often miss.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.180]   I suggest to you, those are my five ideas.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.220]   I'll say all five names again.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.260]   Create synchrony traps, control your meeting availability,
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.180]   really sell your processes,
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.300]   trade accountability for accessibility
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.940]   and crush one thing per month.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.820]   You do those things,
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.260]   if you're one of the 50% who has a remote job right now
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.460]   and you can, if you want,
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.740]   significantly decrease the number of hours
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.900]   during the standard workday that you're spending
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.340]   actually dedicated to that job.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.780]   - That's really solid advice.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.180]   Well, I got a lot.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.740]   - It's interesting, Tim's book,
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.780]   what he focused on, and I talked to him about this
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:16.100]   when I interviewed him for his show.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.860]   So I interviewed him and then we aired that on his show.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.100]   One of the things we talked about is
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.300]   that section of his book got really out of date
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.740]   for a good reason.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.980]   Most of the advice is how in the world
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.060]   are you gonna convince someone to let you work remotely?
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:31.980]   That was like the challenge in 2007.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.620]   How in the world am I gonna convince someone
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.980]   to let me not be in the office?
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.420]   Today, that's not the problem at all.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.900]   That's, if it's not a default,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.700]   it is obviously now a very well understood mode of work
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.660]   because two years ago, according to that graph,
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.740]   85% of people were working remote in the knowledge sector.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.020]   So that whole challenge of how do I convince people
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.220]   that remote work is even feasible,
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.180]   that whole challenge has been solved.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.340]   And so now we can actually put all that planning
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.340]   and hacking energy into,
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.060]   so what do I do with the remote job?
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.620]   So we're making progress.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.740]   - And then establishing the front end
[00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.500]   with the definitions was helpful.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.820]   - Yeah. - To grasp it all.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.180]   - Yeah, like what are you actually trying to do?
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.100]   - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.140]   What are the, what do we mean by this?
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.700]   What do we, yeah, so there we go.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.860]   I don't always do hack stuff,
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.500]   but I feel like we haven't done some hacks in a little bit.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.420]   And I figured let's get in there, hack the job.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.260]   All right, so what we're gonna do
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.380]   in the second segment of the show
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.900]   is I have questions from you, my listeners, all about this,
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.460]   all about figuring out how to maneuver remote work
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.740]   to be more towards your advantage.
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.900]   So we can see real life examples of this advice
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.580]   and similar issues at play.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.940]   First, however, I wanna briefly talk about
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.820]   one of the sponsors that makes this show possible,
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:42.300]   and that is BetterHelp.
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.300]   So this show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.740]   Now we talk about often on the podcast
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.460]   about the five areas of your life,
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.060]   what we call the deep life buckets.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.060]   You have these five areas.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.340]   You need to concentrate on all five
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.060]   to have a fully deep life.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.360]   I sometimes feel like there should be a sixth,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.460]   cognitive hygiene.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.460]   If you aren't building, we could think of it
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.540]   as an amicable functional relationship with your own brain,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.900]   your efforts in the other five buckets of the deep life
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.100]   are gonna go for naught.
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.760]   If you're wracked by anxiety,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.460]   if that anxiety has developed into depression disorder,
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.380]   if there's other types of issues or compulsive thinking,
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.020]   it makes it very difficult for you
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.340]   to enjoy other parts of life
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.740]   or make progress on shaping other parts of life
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.280]   to be truer to your values.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.360]   So cognitive hygiene really should be also
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.840]   one of the buckets that you care about
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.600]   in forming a deep life.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.700]   A therapist is like a highly trained physical trainer
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.460]   for your mind.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.820]   It is an expert that can help you figure out
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.420]   how do I actually live with this wondrous,
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.180]   catastrophic, wonderful, terrifying thing
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.180]   that I call my brain.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.640]   Therapist is like your trainer,
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.760]   your expert to help you build that relationship
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.240]   with yourself.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.420]   This is where better help enters the scene.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.800]   If you've always thought about this,
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.020]   like maybe I should talk to someone,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.060]   but again, it seems daunting.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.500]   I mean, where do I find this person?
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.740]   I've heard that it's very hard to find therapists right now
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.980]   because after the pandemic, they're highly in demand.
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.100]   Better help is your way into this world.
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.100]   So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try,
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:21.820]   better help is a great option.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.900]   It is convenient, flexible, affordable,
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.420]   which is no small thing.
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.100]   And here's their big thing, entirely online.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.460]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.580]   to get matched with a licensed therapist.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.600]   You can even switch therapists anytime you like
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.680]   for no additional charge.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.380]   So if you wanna live a more empowered life
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.740]   and get that cognitive hygiene,
[00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.180]   deep life bucket into shape,
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.060]   therapy can get you there.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.340]   Visit betterhelp.com/,
[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.900]   what's our slash here, Jesse, deep questions?
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.460]   - Yep. - Deep questions.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.360]   To get 10% off your first month,
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   that's betterhelp, H-E-L-P.com/deepquestions.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.540]   Don't forget the slash deep questions
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.340]   so they know you came from me.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.060]   One of the sponsors I wanna briefly talk about
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.380]   is ExpressVPN.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.460]   As I've explained before on a show,
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.460]   a VPN is a critical tool for anyone who uses the internet.
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.020]   It is a tool that allows you to interact with the internet
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.780]   with privacy and with security.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.660]   How this works is instead of just going to the service
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.900]   or the website directly that you wanna talk to,
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.940]   you instead establish a encrypted secure connection
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.420]   with a VPN server.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.740]   You tell that VPN server
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.860]   through this encrypted secure connection,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.040]   this is the website I really wanna talk to.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.860]   This is the service I'm really using.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.780]   And then the server goes and talks to that site
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.700]   and service on your behalf
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.780]   and passes the response back to you
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.660]   through your protected connection.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.620]   Why does this matter?
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.220]   So people can't see what you're doing.
[00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.520]   So let's say you're on a wireless access point
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.760]   at a coffee shop somewhere.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.940]   People who are sniffing your packets out of the air,
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.220]   all they know is Cal is talking
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.820]   on an encrypted connection to a VPN server.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.120]   They have no idea where you're going.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.080]   More importantly, your phone carrier
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.580]   or your internet service provider are allowed to
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:16.260]   and probably are keeping track
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.860]   of what sites and services you're using,
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:20.580]   potentially even selling that information to advertisers.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.140]   If you're using a VPN, they're out of luck.
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.900]   All they learn about you is he was talking
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.620]   through an encrypted connection to a VPN server.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:31.300]   I have no idea who that VPN server was talking to.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.380]   So as a computer scientist,
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.020]   I can tell you, you should use a VPN.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.260]   And if you're gonna use a VPN,
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.060]   use the one I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.560]   They've got the great server coverage.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.320]   They've got the great bandwidth available
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.120]   and they have the really easy to use app,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.100]   which means you just click a button and boom, it's on.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.640]   You don't even realize you're going through a VPN anymore.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.000]   So use ExpressVPN if you're gonna use a VPN.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.280]   To find out more, go to expressvpn.com/deep
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.080]   to get the same VPN I use.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.640]   So take back your online privacy today
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.160]   and use my link to get three extra months free.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.440]   That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-VPN.com/deep,
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.200]   expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.420]   All right, I am excited.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.220]   We get a lot of questions about remote work, Jesse.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:19.800]   So I am excited to get our hands dirty
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.080]   with some real life remote work situation
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.520]   and see if we can help make people take advantage
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.240]   of that situation and make their work life a little better.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.740]   What's our first question today?
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.600]   - All right, first question's from Ian,
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   a 35 year old engineer from San Francisco.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.840]   My family has the opportunity
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.540]   to make a cross country move next year
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.940]   that has a potential to radically realign our lives
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.360]   closer to our values.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.620]   More time with children, each other, out in nature.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.600]   I'll be shifting to a full-time remote work
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.900]   in my engineering role.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.160]   Any advice on how to navigate this change
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.040]   with reverting back to our old, busier ways?
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.680]   - So Ian, what I think is critical here
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.400]   is you are recognizing just the fact
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.360]   that your new job is remote does not mean
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.240]   that automatically it is gonna be a lot of flexibility
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.560]   and autonomy and you're gonna be able
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.720]   to spend a lot more time on the other things you care about.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.480]   Remote work gives you that potential.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.320]   Harvesting that potential is your job and it's hard work.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.180]   So go back, for example, to the five ideas we talked about
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:19.100]   during today's deep dive and give those serious consideration
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.720]   that is the type of concentrated effort you'll need
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.720]   to shape this new role into what you want it actually to be.
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.080]   Two other things I wanna mention beyond that deep dive,
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.720]   two, you might consider this change of job
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.040]   as a good opportunity to renegotiate your role.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.760]   So we talked about during the deep dive
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.240]   that a promotion, for example, was a good time
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.920]   to renegotiate towards an accountability
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.000]   versus accessibility type shift.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.380]   So gaining more accountability
[00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.020]   to lose the need to be so accessible.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.520]   I'll be more remote now.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.440]   I'm away from the office,
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.700]   so I'm gonna be harder to reach,
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.040]   but you really are gonna hold me accountable
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.080]   for the big projects I'm working on.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.840]   A move to a new remote position is a great time
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.240]   to make that type of shift as well.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.560]   The second point I wanna make here
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.000]   goes a little bit off book
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.320]   because I'm drawing from the full version of your question.
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.960]   And in the full version of your question,
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.140]   you mentioned that your spouse is a professor
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.880]   at an R1 research institution.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.360]   So this move is actually being driven by your spouse
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.920]   going to a new academic job.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.160]   So that's an in-person job.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   So you shifted remote so you could follow them to that job.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.080]   They're at an R1 university.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.560]   If your interest is, and I'm reading this here,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.400]   to spend more time with your children
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.080]   and with each other and out in nature.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.340]   The other thing I would suggest
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.560]   as soon as you're making this shift,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.080]   and this is a little bit of insider baseball
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.000]   for non-academics, but I think it's important,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.280]   is set your cost of living such
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.640]   that your spouse does not have to take
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.100]   summer salary out of grants.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.360]   I made this shift three or four years ago,
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.180]   and it was phenomenal.
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.200]   And you guys, I want you to try the same thing.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.200]   So what this means for people who are not academics
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.760]   is most research positions at an R1 research university,
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.880]   if you're a professor,
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.540]   they'll pay your salary for 10 months.
[00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.720]   The other two months of the year,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.160]   typically June or July or July and August,
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.460]   that's your summer months.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.240]   Now you can either not get paid during those months,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:24.060]   or you can get research grants
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.920]   where part of the money in your budget
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   for that research grant is to pay your salary
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.800]   in those two months.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.980]   If you do not do that,
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.660]   if you do not ask for summer salary in your research months,
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.020]   you basically have that time to yourself.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.540]   No one is paying you,
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.060]   and so they cannot expect much of you.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.020]   And you'll see this, universities are pretty good
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.200]   about actually following this.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.060]   There's not meetings and committees
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.180]   and things happening in the summer
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.740]   because that's your time.
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.820]   So that's my other suggestion.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.420]   If you are following my advice, Ian,
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.580]   and gaining a lot of flexibility and autonomy
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.620]   and significantly decreasing the footprint
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.380]   of your remote job on your life,
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.540]   if your spouse can do this with his or her summers,
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:05.740]   you combine those two things,
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.760]   and it's gonna unlock all sorts of cool adventures
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.000]   or way more time together with your values
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.840]   during those summer months.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.740]   So that's an extra bespoke hack
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.420]   that I wanna add onto your shift that you're doing here.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.800]   All right, let's keep rolling.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.680]   - All right, next question is from Catherine,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.600]   a 33-year-old office manager.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.520]   I'm the office manager at a small remote company.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.600]   As the office manager, a lot of my work is reactionary,
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.400]   involves being available for people most of the day.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.840]   For instance, my boss is pinging me
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.680]   anytime something comes to mind.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.060]   How can I practice deep work at my job?
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.680]   - All right, well, Catherine, first of all,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.480]   I don't know if deep work is the right thing
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.420]   to be talking about here in the sense of
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.400]   an office manager position might not require
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.720]   regular extended periods of unbroken concentration.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.320]   It's not really in the job description.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.840]   That doesn't mean, however, that you should be forced
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.880]   to sacrifice yourself to the travails
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:09.040]   of the unbridled hyperactive hive mind.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.560]   So in my book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.000]   I talked about this specifically.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.540]   I broke knowledge work jobs up
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.080]   into multiple different categories.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.960]   And this was one of the categories I talked about.
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.960]   I called it support, but mainly what I meant by this
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:24.320]   is the major part of your job description
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.220]   is reacting to requests to come in
[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.800]   and trying to satisfy them.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.000]   And what I said in email, the goal there is not
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.080]   to get very long periods of time where no one bothers you.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.780]   The goal there is to achieve a workflow
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.560]   in which you can execute one thing at a time
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.260]   without interruption.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.040]   So I'm doing this thing someone asked me to do
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.560]   fully until it's done.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.840]   And now I can expose myself to, okay,
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.680]   what else is going on?
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.500]   What am I gonna do next?
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.240]   And then I'm doing this thing until I'm done.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.040]   And then I shift on to the next.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.920]   The alternative to this is what most people
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.160]   in these type of positions do,
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.520]   which is a constant background hum
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.560]   of tending to the back and forth conversations
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.360]   about the things going on or they're about to do
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.280]   while they're actually trying to do the work themselves.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.680]   And it puts you into this terribly cognitive
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.440]   fatiguing cycle where you're trying to actually execute
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.720]   the tasks that are coming to as the office manager
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.200]   while context shifting like a madman
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.600]   while you're executing the task
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.240]   because you're keeping up with these conversations
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.560]   about other things going on,
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.680]   your brain gets completely fried
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.640]   because it can't shoot back and forth like that.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.520]   And the job becomes exhausting and you burn out.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.840]   So we don't need four hours every day
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.920]   for you to work on your novel,
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.560]   but we need you to have the ability to work 40 minutes
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.840]   on getting this report together
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.520]   before you look at any inbox, before you look at any Slack.
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.360]   So one thing at a time,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.260]   completing it before moving on to the next.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.840]   That's how our mind is wired.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.820]   That is what I want to achieve for you.
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.240]   So Catherine, I'm gonna get super tactical here
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.220]   'cause it's kind of the mood we're in,
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.800]   I think for today's episode.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   And I'm gonna, took some notes here.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.400]   I'm gonna walk through how you can essentially simulate
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.980]   without any extra visible technology,
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.440]   how you can simulate something
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.460]   like an informal ticketing system
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.440]   that help keep track of all of this incoming
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.060]   in a way that allows you to actually be sequential
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.280]   in how you exercise.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.200]   All right, so here's, I'm gonna walk you through this.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.520]   Set up a task board using a program like Trello.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   This is gonna be the base of your informal ticketing system.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.120]   Here are the five columns I want you
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.040]   to add to that task board.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.120]   To process, ready to execute,
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:38.040]   scheduled to execute, waiting to hear back and done.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.280]   Now, here's how you're gonna go forward.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.680]   You will check inboxes, be them email, voicemail,
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.720]   if people still use that or Slack, in between tasks,
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.220]   but never during a task.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.720]   And if a task is very long,
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.760]   well, then you need to break it up into reasonable size.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.680]   Like I'm gonna break it up into a chunk
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.400]   that'll take about 30 to 45 minutes.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.520]   And that's one task, okay?
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.820]   So you're never too far from checking in,
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.360]   but you're not switching away from what you're doing,
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.980]   checking and switching back.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.000]   So you're only checking in between reasonably sized tasks.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.080]   Things that come into your inboxes,
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.600]   you are going to immediately get them out of there.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.920]   Your email inbox is not a knowledge management system.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.680]   It is not a task management system.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.160]   It is a literal mailbox.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.240]   You gotta take the mail out of there
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.140]   and put it somewhere else.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.360]   So for you, what that's gonna mean
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   is when you do these checks,
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:28.880]   you're gonna move everything out of there to a card
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.760]   on your to process column in Trello.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.060]   And you can even just copy the text of the email
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.040]   and paste it on the back of the Trello card.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.480]   So all the information is there,
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.360]   quick summary of what's going on on the front.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.280]   You don't have to make sense of it.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.960]   You don't have to make a plan for it.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:44.800]   It's in your system.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.440]   It's no longer in your inbox, all right?
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.320]   So you're constantly grabbing things in between tasks,
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.820]   adding to your to process column.
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.280]   They're gonna play the role of a ticket here
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.600]   in our informal ticketing system.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:00.080]   All right, now what you need is regular sessions
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.260]   throughout each day.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.840]   I would say maybe two, one mid morning, one mid afternoon
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.360]   for working through those process columns.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.100]   I would schedule this time on my calendar,
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.200]   give yourself about 45 minutes for each of these sessions
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.160]   and schedule on your calendar and protect it.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.120]   Maybe at 10 and three.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.040]   As you go through everything that's built up
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.080]   in the to process column,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.440]   you have a few options for each item.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.480]   If it's a very quick thing,
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.960]   someone has a question you can easily answer
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.240]   or you have to just go on their behalf and whatever,
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.280]   add their requests to buy paperclips
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.780]   to the list you keep of what to buy in your next order,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.520]   just do it, move that card to done.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.480]   If you need more information
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.440]   from the person who sent you the request,
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.960]   which is often the case
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.200]   and part of what makes the support roles really annoying
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.360]   is that the people you work for, the managers are often,
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.880]   me need pewter good and just send,
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.760]   you're like, I don't know what this means.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   They're just trying to get it off of their head
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.120]   using you as like a reminder system, very frustrating,
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.560]   but it happens all the time.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.320]   So you need more information from the respondent.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   You can request that they clarify
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.120]   maybe by calling you during office hours.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.040]   Remember office hours, I always come back to that.
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.100]   If you run, if you're an office manager,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.840]   you should have probably twice a day office hours.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.520]   You say, yeah, just call me, blah, blah, blah,
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.480]   at any of these days, and we'll figure out in more detail
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.580]   what I can do for you.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.880]   It's all about how I can help you.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.720]   You gotta play that, you gotta play that game.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.160]   Or if you need to send a request to someone else
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.080]   to answer their question,
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   they're asking you me want computer good.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.000]   So you have to talk to the IT department
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.440]   about the computer replacement cycle.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.920]   So if you have to request something else on behalf of them,
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.400]   you're gonna move that card
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.880]   to the waiting to hear back column.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.460]   And you just write right there on the card
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.680]   under the description of what it is,
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.480]   who you're waiting to hear back from.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:53.360]   I asked Jesse to stop by office hours at some point
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.480]   and clarify the question.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.680]   I sent this request over to IT on Monday,
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.000]   waiting to hear back.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.100]   So you have it, lost it.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.280]   It's not in your inbox, it's not in your head.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.040]   It is right there.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.520]   The other thing that you might be doing
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.680]   as you're going, the other options
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.240]   you're going through this to process column
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.600]   is clarifying specifically what needs to be done.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:17.320]   So again, you're translating from the informally type thing
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.860]   into here's what really has to happen.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.440]   A request has to go over here
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.140]   and then we have to file this form, wait to hear back.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.800]   You're clarifying, okay, this is specifically
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.920]   the work that needs to be done here.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.240]   And so for complex tasks that are in the two process column,
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.160]   this is what you're doing with them.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.200]   You're clarifying what really needs to be done.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.240]   If it is something that needs to happen on a specific day,
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:38.480]   put it on your calendar,
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.240]   move the card to the schedule to execute column.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.400]   If it's something that's big enough
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.260]   that it doesn't have to happen on a particular day,
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.880]   but if you don't put aside time for it,
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.020]   it's not gonna get done.
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.900]   Go schedule that on your calendar.
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.040]   This morning, this afternoon,
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.360]   I'm working on this big request that came in
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.760]   and move the card to schedule to execute.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.460]   Otherwise move the card to ready to execute,
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:02.020]   which is just things, do them next time you get a chance.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.680]   You know, you clarified what it is
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.300]   and it's do them next time you get a chance.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:11.760]   In all cases, this is what really
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.600]   simulates a ticketing system.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.280]   Whenever something moves from one column to another,
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.700]   send the note to the original source of that task,
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.240]   keeping people up to speed.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.620]   So that means when you first add something to two process,
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.440]   it's Jesse, I got your note.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:29.400]   It's in my queue, I'm gonna get to it.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.320]   I'll keep you posted.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.920]   So they know that you saw it.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.240]   When you realize you have to ask IT something
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.720]   and you move it over to the waiting to hear back,
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.600]   hey, Jesse, just to let you know,
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.160]   I put in a request to IT, we're gonna figure this out.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.560]   I'll keep you posted and I'll let you know when I hear back.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.680]   They know what's going on.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.180]   If you move it over to, you know, schedule to execute,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.280]   you can say, hey, I got your request.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.240]   It's on my calendar.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.600]   I'm tackling it on this day.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.000]   I'll let you know when I'm done, right?
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.320]   So you're always keeping people up to speed
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.720]   with what is going on.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.560]   So that's the system.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.720]   And then in all of your other time during the day,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.760]   when you're not doing any of these things
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.580]   I just talked about,
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.280]   you're just pulling something off that ready to execute list
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.360]   and just doing it, send in an update.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.200]   You put all that together
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.400]   and you have something like an informal ticketing system.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.360]   People are up to speed on what you're doing
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.200]   and what the status is.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.880]   So they won't demand this minute to minute accessibility.
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.040]   Like, I don't even know if you got this.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.440]   You better answer me right away.
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:20.800]   You've gained yourself the breathing room
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   you need to actually work on things until they're done
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.640]   before moving on to the next thing.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.820]   This all might sound like a huge headache,
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.840]   a lot of overhead, but I'm telling you, Catherine,
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   if you're able to work on one thing at a time
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.200]   with no interruption,
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.040]   if you're able to have captured everything
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.800]   that needs to be done and all the relevant information
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.840]   in one place,
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:42.160]   where you're not at all stressed about open loops
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.920]   or things you're forgetting,
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.880]   the cognitive drain of your job
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.080]   will be significantly reduced.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.880]   In fact, you might even actually rediscover some joy for,
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.240]   hey, I like this company.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:54.360]   I play a key role in this thing operating.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.080]   I'm valued by people.
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.600]   And I feel good about what I'm doing.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   You can get back to that if you achieve those properties.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.880]   Now you don't have to use this particular system.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   I just came up with these particular details.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.200]   But my point is,
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:10.480]   this is what high-end elite knowledge work
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.880]   management systems look like.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.840]   These are the type of things
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:15.080]   that you probably need in place
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.920]   if you have a high churn job.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.760]   If you have a job where things are coming at you really quick
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.200]   and you don't wanna just completely burn out,
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.680]   this is what these systems look like.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.080]   There's not just one tool
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.520]   that's gonna solve this for you.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.360]   You gotta engineer information flow
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.520]   and task flow and time flow.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.680]   It's non-trivial, but this effort is worth it.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.600]   These type of things make a huge difference
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:33.800]   once you get them right.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.360]   It's like my old days, Jesse.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.000]   The systems and hacking.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:38.840]   - Yeah.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.320]   - That's like an old pitch you don't lose.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.080]   It's like a knuckle curve.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.720]   You asked me to build a system
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.880]   around information or task flows.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:47.720]   - I'll do it.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.560]   I love it.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.400]   - Yeah.
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   All right, let's keep rolling here.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   - All right, next question.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:53.240]   Jason from Louisiana.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.040]   I've recently accepted a job as an editor
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.280]   at a major Christian publishing house.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.040]   It's a remote position with autonomy and flexibility.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.440]   I'm wondering what advice you have
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.640]   on how to balance this job
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.400]   while maintaining my own research and writing projects.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.680]   - Schedule first reasonable time
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   for your individual research and writing projects
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.800]   in a way that's not gonna grossly infringe
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.640]   on your normal jobs.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.040]   Don't say, well, from 10 to two,
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   Monday through Friday, I work on my book.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.720]   In the morning, the afternoon,
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.040]   you put it in reasonable time
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.960]   and build some good rituals around that.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.560]   Where do I go and what do I do?
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.160]   Right before I start working.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.440]   Then consider that time off limits
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.800]   and work around it for the rest of your job.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.760]   There's a little fixed schedule productivity.
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.040]   I write these mornings and it's one afternoon.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.520]   Now I gotta figure out how to make the rest of my job work.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.040]   And just use all the different types of ideas
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.720]   I've talked about.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.760]   The same enemies that we talked about in the beginning,
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.840]   this shows your enemies here.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.520]   The more that all your work unfolds
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:52.680]   with informal back and forth,
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.200]   the harder it is to ever be away from it.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.720]   The more that meetings can happen
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.840]   at any time at any place,
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.960]   the harder it is to get away from that.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.240]   So you can put those type of ideas
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.840]   into the hopper, but just work backwards from,
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.560]   this is time I'm writing.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.240]   And so let me work around it.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.800]   You would be surprised.
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.480]   This approach, which I call fixed schedule productivity,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:13.400]   you would be surprised about how innovative it makes you.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.920]   It's like my rule that I try not to work
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.400]   outside of a standard roughly nine to five
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.280]   or nine to five 30 work hours,
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:22.360]   even though I have nine jobs.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.280]   The power of just knowing this is my constraints
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.360]   and I make my work fit in those constraints
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.320]   has generated untold productivity innovation.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.880]   So the simplest ideas can generate
[00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.160]   the most complicated responses.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.320]   So just schedule that time, Jason,
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.280]   be reasonable about it, work around it.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.080]   All right, what do we got?
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.720]   - Next question is from Courtney,
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.880]   a 40 year old from the Bay Area.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.280]   My remote software job has a lot of things I like,
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.360]   autonomy, flexible schedule, and pretty good pay.
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.840]   Now that I'm more senior, however,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.200]   I don't feel like I have much room to grow.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.760]   The only option would be going to management,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.160]   which is a hundred percent hyperactive high mind
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.400]   and miserable.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.200]   Should I go back to the drawing board with a new career?
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.400]   - Well, Courtney, here's my follow-up.
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.800]   Why do you need room to grow?
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:09.360]   And I don't mean that to be dismissive or facetious.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.160]   I actually think this is a common assumption
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.800]   that we should examine.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.200]   So what I can tell from your question
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.240]   and the more elaborated version that you sent me
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.680]   is there's this baseline assumption
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.360]   that I need to be continually growing in my job,
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:29.080]   meaning salary, prestige, responsibility
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.400]   has to keep going up,
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.400]   much in the same way that economic growth has to continue
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.200]   or we're not gonna be able to pay back the loans
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.480]   that we just took out and the whole economy will collapse.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.080]   And so we often have this growth mindset
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.120]   around our careers.
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.440]   Now, this is a good mindset, especially early on.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.840]   You know, when you're in a knowledge work job
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.120]   and you're 22,
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.680]   it's not a very good knowledge work job, right?
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.920]   And if you just said, why do I need to grow?
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.800]   I'm perfectly happy in this entry-level knowledge work job.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.680]   I'm very good at getting the coffee to my boss
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.560]   and Xeroxing or whatever.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.960]   It's probably low salary, low autonomy.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.040]   You don't have a lot of career capital.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   That's not so great.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.560]   But when you've got to a point
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.280]   and in your 40s, you can get there, no problem.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.280]   When you get to the point
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.880]   where you have a lot of career capital,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:13.480]   meaning you have a lot of leverage in your job
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.120]   and your essay and how that job unfolds,
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.880]   you can craft something that fits really well
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.480]   with your vision for the other bucket of money
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.800]   and buckets of your deep life.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.040]   Now we have to be careful
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.680]   about growth for the sake of growth.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.800]   Now we're thinking about how does my work fit
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.120]   into my bigger vision of my life?
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.280]   And that might mean I need to get here.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.560]   I'm here, but if I could get here,
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.080]   it unlocks all these other visions I have
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.040]   for these other parts of my life.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.120]   And then, yeah, then that's what we're doing.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.760]   We're getting after that, figuring it out.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.720]   But it might be with, this is great.
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:42.040]   I like my job. I'm good at it.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:43.520]   It's flexible. It's autonomous.
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.720]   I like where we live.
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.240]   The other buckets, constitution, community, contemplation
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.320]   are all, I'm developing those.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.000]   I'm giving more time into those.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.680]   Maybe my parents are aging and we live near them
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.120]   and I want to spend more time around them
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:57.440]   or have young kids or something.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.280]   It's completely fine.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.400]   I say, this job is great.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   I love it and it pays well and they like me.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.920]   And I don't want to go into management
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.440]   and I don't want to start over.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.600]   Most employers are happy if you're like,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.760]   look, I just want to kill it at this for a while.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.160]   I have other things going on in my life
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.560]   and this is really good for me and let's just do that.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.000]   So I want you to consider that, Courtney.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.400]   The good enough job, which is actually the name of a book
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.800]   that's not out yet, I don't think, but I blurbed it
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:26.640]   and I liked it.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:27.840]   I read it and I blurbed it.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.120]   It's called "The Good Enough Job", great title.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:34.920]   Is sometimes the best option, at least for a while.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.880]   So I don't know if that's your situation, Courtney,
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.960]   but I'm using your question as an excuse
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.280]   to talk about this idea more generally.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.960]   That the goal is not continual growth.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.080]   The goal is building a deep life
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.440]   in which each of the buckets is humming
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.800]   close to whatever your vision is for it.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.000]   And so, especially for these sort of high-powered
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.320]   Bay Area engineering type jobs, people get there.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:00.920]   They can get there by their late 30s, early 40s
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.000]   and have a lot of flexibility.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.960]   So consider that, Courtney.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.640]   Maybe that's just what you do for a while.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.480]   I think your bosses would probably be ecstatic about it.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.960]   And I think you're right to not want to go
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.560]   into a management role at a job
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.880]   where that means 100% hyperactive hive mind.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.280]   To me, that's the equivalent of it's a game show
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   where someone says, "Look, we are gonna give you
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.880]   "it's Fear Factor.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.880]   "We're gonna give you this bag with a 50% salary increase,
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.280]   "but we're also gonna kick you in the groin every hour."
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:39.120]   I'm not gonna enjoy the 50% salary increase
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.760]   if Fear Factor host Joe Rogan,
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.840]   who used to be a national kickboxing champion
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:45.640]   is kicking me in the groin every hour.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.800]   I think I'd rather just not have the 50% salary increase
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.920]   and keep my groin less kicked.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:56.000]   This is a very important metaphor, Courtney, very precise.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.680]   So sometimes getting a promotion can be Joe Rogan
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.520]   kicking you in the groin.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.360]   That's what I'm trying to say here.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.000]   That's what everyone has been trying to say.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.440]   They just haven't been able to articulate it as well.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.360]   So keep that in mind.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.200]   Do you need growth?
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.080]   Maybe just chill for a little bit.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.760]   There's other parts of life that are cool as well.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.200]   All right, we've got one last thing here.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.200]   It's actually, it's a case study, not a question.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.800]   So occasionally someone will send in a question
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.880]   that I think is more, the question itself
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.480]   is actually just an interesting case study
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.400]   of the modern world of work and issues we care about.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.000]   So I'm gonna read this one here.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.200]   This is from Peter, a 35 year old software engineer.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.760]   So here's what Peter wrote.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.600]   "I worked for a remote only tech company
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.800]   "where everything about the way they worked
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.000]   "was very intentional.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.680]   "They embraced almost exclusively asynchronous deep work
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.200]   "from the CEO down with a particular emphasis
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   "on only work on one thing at a time,
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.680]   "only have one top priority at a time.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   "In many ways, it was great.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.440]   "However, everything centered around
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.480]   "the company-wide project tracker
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.120]   "that served as a knowledge base,
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.280]   "a documentation layer, and a status tracker.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.640]   "I could go read the latest draft
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.840]   "of the marketing company's upcoming blog post
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.960]   "or look at how the backend team
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.120]   "was tackling a new challenge.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.800]   "I tried to prune my intake,
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.280]   "but it became clear that the people that excelled there
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.680]   "were the ones that involved themselves
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.760]   "in many things at once.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.360]   "These people were subscribed to many different initiatives
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.520]   "across the company and could inhale mass amounts
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   "of constant project updates,
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.400]   "remember many of the little details
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.800]   "about where everything was.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.280]   "In short, hooking into the hive mind
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.320]   "was seemingly at odds with the one top priority mantra.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.320]   "I used to think I was good at this sort of thing,
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.640]   "but somewhere between COVID and the birth of my second kid,
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.680]   "I seemed to have lost the ability
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.840]   "to keep tons of statuses in my head.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.280]   "I wanted to excel, but I quickly learned
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.200]   "that I couldn't keep up and ended up burning out.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.880]   "This was all with a virtually free calendar
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.400]   "and lots of autonomy in my day-to-day work.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.440]   "Should I have done something differently?
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.480]   "Should this company have structured
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.120]   "or encouraged something else?"
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.680]   So I wanted to use this as a case study
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.200]   instead of a question because it pointed out
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.440]   something critical about even an intentional
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.960]   remote work environment.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.640]   So we talked about how to make remote work work,
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.760]   get away from the hyperactive hive mind
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.720]   of things happening with unscheduled
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.640]   back and forth messaging.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.040]   Tons of emails, tons of Slack, tons of meetings.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.440]   This company that Peter's talking about
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.040]   actually had accomplished that.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.000]   I think it's inaccurate.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.400]   He referred to this behavior of inhaling information
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.040]   from the project management system
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   as quote, "hooking into the hive mind."
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.000]   This is actually different than that, I think, Peter.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.560]   The hive mind to me is very specific
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.000]   about collaboration unfolding
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.680]   with these unscheduled back and forth messaging.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.560]   So you have to constantly be keeping track of these things.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.560]   This was a little bit different.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.920]   This was making the ability to follow
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.520]   and be a part of many different projects low friction.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.120]   This is what was going on there.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.920]   And this points out even an intentionally designed
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.640]   remote work company can fall into traps
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.480]   beyond the hyperactive hive mind.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.480]   So the trap that is being illustrated here
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.200]   that I wanna just quickly highlight
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.120]   is controlling workload per project,
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.920]   but not the number of projects.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.080]   So you have a philosophy, and this I think is common,
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.480]   especially in tech oriented remote first companies.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.960]   You have a mantra of one thing at a time, it's scrum boards.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.800]   Like this is your task.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.640]   And when you're done, you can pull another one in.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   That's all great, but then they don't restrict
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.440]   how many different projects you're involved in.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.880]   And it's up to you.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.240]   And like, well, I could subscribe to this one.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.160]   It's right here in the system.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.000]   And this one, I could be involved in this one and that one.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.840]   And no single project maybe has you doing
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.880]   more than one thing at a time, but you have seven projects.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.200]   And it's the same as having one project
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:30.600]   giving you seven different things to do,
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.400]   and you end up burned out.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.600]   And if there is no systematic way
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.360]   to control your overall workload,
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.600]   then you're just thrown into a situation where it says,
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.160]   hey, it's up to you, but you know,
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.320]   if you're doing more projects,
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.160]   we're gonna look at you a little bit more positively.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.000]   And then what happens?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.040]   The young ones with all their energy
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.880]   start to climb the ranks, and the rest of us,
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.680]   like Peter, who were exhausted by COVID
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.280]   and have kids at home, we fall behind.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.320]   And then you begin to just create the split.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.240]   And then all the young people,
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.400]   they get promoted much faster,
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.840]   and they start saying things like fire and cap and base,
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.440]   and they shift all of the operations
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.000]   to TikTok and everyone dies.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   That's not great.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.600]   So you have, this is a common mistake
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.160]   where you feel like you're a smart remote work company,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.000]   but you're not.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.480]   You control workload for project, but not project workloads.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.400]   The other issue, this was not in Peter's message,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.800]   but I'll just mention it 'cause I've heard about it a lot,
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.320]   is you get too obsessive about the details.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.880]   I think this plagued a lot of people
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.000]   who adopted agile methodologies like Scrum
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.120]   with their common task boards and standing meetings,
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.560]   is that because engineers like me are sometimes
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.360]   on the nerdier end of the social spectrum, let's say,
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.800]   we get obsessive.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:46.040]   And then it's, what matters is as the third degree
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.720]   Scrum master on an alternative Wednesday,
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.920]   I have to roll 2D12 to see if we're able
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:56.680]   to advance the pull methodology one more layer
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.040]   towards the dungeon of despair.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.880]   It just becomes obsessing about the rules
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.680]   for the sake of obsessing about the rules.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.160]   And then that's terrible too.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.720]   So those are two traps that you can get away
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.960]   from the hive mind, but still be in a dangerous territory.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.640]   So you have to control the overall workload,
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.840]   not just per project, and be worried about obsessing
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.360]   over the details of your systems.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.800]   They're just a guide to help you get away
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.120]   from constant back and forth.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.840]   It's not the Talmud.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.720]   We do not have to pour over the Scrum master guide
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.520]   to make sure that we're using the right terminology.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.960]   All right, Jesse, so that's basically what I have to say
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   about remote work and hacking remote work.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.840]   So again, if you're one of the people who is still remote,
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.800]   keep those ideas in mind.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.920]   I like to end every episode
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.360]   with a something interesting segment.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.760]   We do something different today.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.520]   I'll report on the books I read last month.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.040]   First, I wanna briefly mention another sponsor
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.120]   that makes this show possible.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.340]   That's our friends at ZocDoc.com.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.760]   So this is pretty common.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.360]   Let's say you have a health issue.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.160]   You don't have an established relationship
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.500]   with a doctor for that type of health issue.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.340]   Your foot hurts.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.480]   You don't know a podiatrist.
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.040]   You don't have a primary care physician.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.280]   How do you find a doctor?
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.840]   A lot of people, especially people my age
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.000]   or a little younger, get stuck.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.820]   Like, I don't know.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:12.760]   I asked my friend.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.580]   I walk down the street and look for one of those two snakes,
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.160]   Hippocratic snakes biting each other,
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.520]   and just say, "That must be a doctor's office."
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.360]   Like, we don't know what to do.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.240]   So we get stuck, and we invent annoying words like adulting
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.680]   to explain why we're not actually making progress.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.080]   What's really happening is it's difficult.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.160]   This is where ZocDoc comes in.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.720]   It is a free app, in fact, the only free app
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.680]   that lets you find and book doctors
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.440]   who are patient-reviewed, take your insurance,
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.560]   and available when you need them,
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.220]   and treat almost every condition under the sun.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.360]   You look up doctors.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   Here's nearby doctors.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.620]   Here's reviews from real patients.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:48.640]   Do they take my insurance?
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:49.480]   Yes.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:50.900]   Let me just book a meeting with this doctor
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.160]   all through the same app.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.800]   This is the right way to do healthcare.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.200]   You should be using ZocDoc.
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.040]   This is true, Jesse.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:58.580]   It says in my ad notes here,
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.160]   it says in my ad notes that younger people
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.240]   are using TikTok to try to figure out
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.580]   medical care decisions.
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:11.200]   - Yeah. - That's a problem.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.020]   That's a problem.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.920]   You need ZocDoc.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.680]   If you're using TikTok to figure out
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.400]   your medical conditions,
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.640]   you're gonna be giving yourself a prescription
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.040]   of a fire dance, and you just start dancing.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.700]   And about halfway through the dance,
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.920]   your friend is like, "Yeah, but you still got
[01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.480]   "that six-inch rebar going through your spine."
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.320]   And you're like, "Yeah, you're right.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.080]   "I probably should use ZocDoc.com."
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.600]   So you need ZocDoc, the only free app
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.440]   that lets you find and book doctors.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.000]   Now, we do have a little bit of a contest.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.820]   I should mention this.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.880]   We do have a little bit of a contest.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:41.640]   We like ZocDoc.com because there's a lot of ox in it.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.200]   So we have a kind of informal contest
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   of what could be an even cooler ox-centric URL.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.240]   And you remember this, Jesse, 'cause I sent it to you.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.280]   Someone sent us the idea of,
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.420]   what was it, like, what if the Dwayne Johnson,
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.200]   was this right?
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.160]   Dwayne, or was this mine?
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.060]   Dwayne Johnson has a website
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:06.960]   where he helps you make model-size docs
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.760]   for like model train displays.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.800]   And his website was rockmockdoc.com.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.480]   That was a good one.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.040]   Now it's got zocdoc.com, but rockmockdoc.com.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.920]   I like that.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.400]   So anyways, go to zocdoc.com/deep
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.240]   and download the ZocDoc app for free.
[01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.240]   Then find a book at top-rated doctor today,
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.160]   many available within 24 hours.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.880]   For God's sake, stop using TikTok to diagnose yourself.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   That's zocdoc.com/deep, zocdoc.com/deep.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:39.720]   I also want to mention our friends at Ladder.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.400]   So we're talking about things you should be doing,
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.840]   but you're not because you don't know how to get started.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.280]   Life insurance is the other big one.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.880]   If there is anyone who depends on you,
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.920]   a spouse, a partner, kids, you need life insurance.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.600]   Why don't you have life insurance?
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.280]   Because you don't know how to get it.
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.320]   So I'm going to tell you how to get it very easily.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.480]   You go to Ladder.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.400]   Ladder is your solution to doing this.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.760]   It's 100% digital.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.260]   You don't have to do any doctors or needles or paperwork.
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.280]   If you're applying for $3 million in coverage or less,
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.400]   you just answer a few questions
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.260]   about your health and an application.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.120]   There's smart algorithms working real time.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.040]   You'll find out if you're instantly approved,
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.160]   no hidden fees, cancel anytime,

[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:26.400]   These are all policies that are insured by insurers
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:29.600]   rated A or A+ by AMBEST, they're high quality.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.640]   So you just go to the website, ladderlife.com/deep,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.840]   type, type, type, done.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.000]   It's off your to-do list.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.200]   This thing that you have no idea,
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.040]   you know you're supposed to do it,
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.760]   you have no idea how to do it, it's off your to-do list.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.240]   You should do this right now.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:45.440]   So go to ladderlife.com/deep today

[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:54.640]   Ladderlife.com/deep.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.040]   All right, Jessie, we like to talk about each month,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.040]   the books I read the last month.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.240]   Long-time listeners know,
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.640]   my goal is to read five books per month.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.400]   So we're in February now,
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   so we will talk about the five books I read in January, 2023.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:20.280]   The first one was called "Sitting by the Mini Bay,
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.380]   My Life in Building Model Docs" by Dwayne Johnson.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:28.380]   So that was a surprising twist, surprising turn by him.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.980]   It has over 50 pages of photos.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.020]   He's shirtless in most of them, interesting.
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.220]   He builds his mock docs shirtless.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.780]   So there you go.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.620]   Now, what did I read?
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:39.620]   All right, let's go through this quickly.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.980]   Book number one, "A Thousand Brains" by Jeff Hawkins.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.500]   So this is a new theory about how the cortex
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.500]   helps create human consciousness and intelligence.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.000]   Jeff Hopkins is a former tech executive
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.140]   who put all of his fortune
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.180]   into trying to figure out how the brain works
[01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:00.980]   and then build intelligent machines using this research.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:04.200]   This is his latest book with his latest findings.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.780]   If ever there's like Reese Terminator-style character
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:08.660]   who comes back from the future
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.740]   to prevent Skynet from going online,
[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.300]   he's probably gonna be looking for Jeff Hawkins,
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.620]   let's be honest about that.
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.780]   All right, I also read "The 90s" by Chuck Klosterman.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.260]   So Klosterman writes these books where,
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.620]   I don't know if you've ever seen a Klosterman book,
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.060]   but he's been doing these more recently.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:25.020]   Like the 90s is just looking at the 90s
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.980]   and it's just all these different smart cultural critiques
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.280]   about different aspects of the 90s,
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.860]   which is when you and I were kids.
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:33.960]   It was good.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.620]   I've heard it was really good on tape.
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.420]   I read the physical version.
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:38.240]   I enjoyed it.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.340]   I mean, it helps that I grew up then,
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:40.620]   but actually I might lend it to you.
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:41.460]   I think you would like it.
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.020]   Any examples?
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.740]   I mean, I think the music stuff is interesting.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.660]   Like he gets really deep on really
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:51.140]   what was happening behind the scenes
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.980]   with grunge and these musicians
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.820]   and the whole selling out culture that Gen X had created
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.900]   and how that clashed against the commercial imperatives
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.740]   of music.
[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.100]   I actually learned a lot about,
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.600]   like Kurt Cobain, for example.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.620]   Interesting.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.540]   It doesn't make me think of,
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.100]   I don't look back after I read this book and say,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.740]   "Man, I wish I could go back to the 90s."
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:12.740]   It's an interesting time.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.700]   And it's interesting to think about,
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:15.700]   but it doesn't make me want to go back.
[01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.780]   But you know what I found out?
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:18.940]   You remember the 70s show?
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:20.740]   So when we were growing up in the 90s,
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.260]   there's a show called the 70s show,
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.260]   which was a sitcom about life in the 70s.
[01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.560]   Well, now we're 30 years,
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.820]   20 or 30 years out of the 90s.
[01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.980]   They're doing a new show called the 90s show.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.160]   Because when we were growing up in the 90s,
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.100]   the 70s was as far from us as the 90s are far
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.220]   from people who are kids today.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.020]   So our childhood is now going to be the target
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:44.020]   of the nostalgic retrospective show.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.580]   It was a good time to be a New York Yankee fan if you were.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.220]   Yeah, late 90s.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:49.880]   All right.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.140]   Then I read a quite a good thriller actually.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.100]   Robin Cook's very first thriller, "Coma"
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:59.340]   from the 1970s, straight up,
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.020]   one of the first medical thrillers.
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.520]   So him and Crichton were both working on this,
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.680]   but Cook was, I believe he got to the punch first.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.180]   And it's, you know, it's creepy as hell.
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.640]   Like in the end there's coma patients.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.460]   They're being put into comas surreptitiously
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:17.080]   so they could harvest their organs, not the spoiler alert.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:17.920]   Really well-written.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.500]   The interesting thing about it,
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.980]   unlike some modern thrillers is it's,
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.260]   I don't know, the last third
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:29.020]   before you get to any actual, I am being chased.
[01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.980]   Like any, I mean, the first two thirds of the book
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:33.340]   is really this new resident sort of starting
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:37.060]   to unravel the conspiracy and doing investigations.
[01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:39.920]   And the main stakes are, you know,
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.120]   her supervisors at the hospital are mad at her
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.000]   or that if she's not at round, she might get in trouble.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.240]   So it's such, and yet it still works.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.580]   Nowadays, a modern thriller, it's, you know,
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.760]   the second page, the shark is being shot at you
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.880]   from the cannon and you have to kill it with a laser sword.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.060]   You know, it gets right into it.
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:57.560]   So different time, but great book.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.080]   - When you read thrillers, do you breeze through them?
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.240]   - I'm not a fast reader.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.800]   My wife is a fast reader.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.760]   When she reads novels, she's like,
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.400]   I'm just, because I read a lot of nonfiction
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.880]   and write a lot of nonfiction, it's hard for me to speed up.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.080]   So I'm the guy reading that's thinking,
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.280]   okay, well, interesting.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.440]   They referenced the computer mainframe in chapter two
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.920]   and they noted that it was using hexadecimal.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.880]   And now we're in chapter four and I'm wondering,
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.440]   you know, I'm reading these thrillers
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.920]   like I'm studying Proust,
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.600]   which is probably not the fastest way to do it.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.280]   - When you say you're not fast, are you really fast?
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.240]   - I don't read these books very fast.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.360]   I'm not a speed reader or not.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.280]   I'm not even like a fast reader.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.520]   I go too slow because my mind always wants
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.240]   to understand everything and fit everything into,
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:44.600]   I'm gonna, what Jeff Hawkins at a thousand brains
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.480]   would call reference frames.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.280]   My brain, that book helped me understand my own brain.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.680]   I have like an overactive reference frame system.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.080]   Everything I encounter has to be fit into these frames
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.640]   and I'm incredibly unhappy until it is.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.960]   So I can't read things fast.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.560]   I can't have loose ends.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.440]   I need to, okay, here's this person, here's the building,
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.120]   here's the rooms in the building.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.720]   Like it's very useful when it comes time
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   to solve math proofs or write things,
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.200]   but I can't, I'm just physically uncomfortable.
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.120]   If it doesn't bother my wife at all.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.840]   If she's like, oh, I don't remember if like,
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   oh, who is this guy?
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.680]   Was he dead?
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.560]   Or, you know, I'm like, no, no,
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.200]   I need to know like exactly his,
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.640]   like who did he connect to?
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.400]   How is this house laid out?
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.520]   So I can't read fast.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.280]   I mean, you're right, maybe it's fast compared to,
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:28.880]   depends on the relative.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.320]   - One more quick question about this.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.280]   When you read a 10 page New York article,
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.360]   how long does it usually take you?
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.840]   - A while.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.480]   If I read like a standard, because you know,
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.960]   I always try to read at least one article
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.760]   from the magazine each week when it comes out.
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.760]   - Half an hour?
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.600]   - Yeah.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.720]   Like I'll read it in the morning sometimes
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.080]   for the kids get up and it will take the whole time.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.760]   And sometimes I'll have to come back to it.
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.640]   Yeah, because I'm like every,
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.040]   because, but I'll come away and be able to tell you
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.520]   everything that happened in that New Yorker article,
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.960]   some of the stylistic choices of the author,
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.280]   you know, and I pulled out like two second order theories
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.040]   that we could potentially talk about on the show.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.080]   So it's like a very cognitively involved process for me
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.920]   when I'm reading.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:10.160]   I'm a machine for turning text into connected,
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.080]   internally consistent theories and ideas.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.560]   Like that's what I am.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.000]   I've been like bred in a lab to do that.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.200]   All right, next, this is not really a book.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.160]   Neither of these are really books,
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.400]   but I just read them back to back
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.040]   because one influenced the other.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.880]   I read this over Martin Luther King weekend
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.560]   was Thoreau's on civil disobedience.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.840]   And then Martin Luther King's letter from a Birmingham jail,
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.160]   the latter of course, inspired by him
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.080]   pulling from the former.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.040]   So I thought it'd be interesting to read those,
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.240]   read those back to back.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:42.280]   MLK's I think is much better than Thoreau's.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.040]   I mean, I get Thoreau's at the time,
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.280]   I mean, obviously it was an innovative thought.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   Gandhi pulled from an MLK pulled from it,
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.960]   but it doesn't age as well.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:52.640]   And in part because he created a world
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   that's been more normalized.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.480]   So it doesn't seem as retroactive, but it's, you know,
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.360]   I'm not gonna pay my tax until my friend comes
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.480]   like three hours later and pays for me
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.280]   to get out of my small jail in the town
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.240]   where I'm related to everybody.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.600]   It just feels very different.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   I'm an MLK as a rhetorician is so good.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.320]   Just his ability to make an argument
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.720]   and to inject a sort of a humanity into it.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.880]   Yet it's still just rock solid.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.920]   This clicks to this,
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.560]   this sort of inevitable logic with emotion.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.120]   I mean, just absolute once in a century type ability.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.560]   So you read these back to back and Thoreau,
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.360]   I mean, I love Thoreau.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:34.920]   Thoreau's very influential to me,
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:38.360]   but you see the person who's really throwing
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.840]   the 105 mile per hour fastballs MLK there.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.680]   Yeah, not Thoreau.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.560]   And then the last was, well, I don't know how many people
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.440]   are gonna follow me up on this recommendation.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.560]   The Feynman lectures on computation.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.240]   There's a book form collection of a series of lectures
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:58.800]   that Richard Feynman gave at Caltech about computation.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.240]   And I've pulled from it before for various classes I taught,
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.200]   but I read that right at the beginning of January
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.400]   because I didn't teach last semester.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.240]   I was on leave.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.080]   And then before that was summer.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.320]   So I hadn't been in the classroom since May, 2020.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.840]   And I wanted to get back in the mood.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.680]   So I was like, all right,
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.040]   I'm gonna read Feynman's lectures on computation.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.520]   Just to get back in the computer science,
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.680]   he pedagogical, Feynman's a physicist,
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.600]   not a computer scientist.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.360]   And he just, so he comes at these things
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.800]   like with really originality and new takes.
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.440]   I just thought it would put me back in the mood of,
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.600]   you know, hey, let's explain things to people
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.880]   in useful ways.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.720]   It was pretty good.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:33.720]   I would say like 50% of the stuff
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.120]   I really loved reading about, 20% I'd know it so well.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.160]   I teach it and the fields advanced since Feynman wrote it.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.920]   I'm like, this is like a worst version of it.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.280]   And then the other, whatever percent is left
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.840]   was really just physics stuff I didn't care about.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.360]   The stupid reversible circuit stuff.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   It's like, I don't need to hear any more
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.200]   about reversible circuits,
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   but like his information theory
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.000]   and coding theory chapter is fantastic.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:57.840]   So there you go.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:58.680]   I don't know how many people will take me up
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.600]   on that last recommendation,
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.640]   but the Feynman lectures on computation
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.760]   doesn't move as fast as coma by Robin Cook.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.520]   It's not the similar genre, but I enjoyed it.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.080]   All right, I got to run.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.920]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.800]   If you want to submit your own questions or case studies,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:16.360]   there is a link in the show notes.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.800]   If you want to watch what you just heard today,
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.120]   it's episode 236.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.480]   Go to youtube.com/calendarportmedia.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.400]   I'll be back next week.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.800]   And until then, as always stay deep.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.840]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.080]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:37.140]   (upbeat music)
