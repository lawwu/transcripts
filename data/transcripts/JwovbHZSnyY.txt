[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660]   Hiatt, they have this find experiences program
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.840]   and it's kind of unique.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.860]   I haven't really seen anything like it before
[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.640]   where the hotel chain,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.700]   kind of like how Airbnb has experiences,
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.060]   has a whole experience program
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.500]   that's not necessarily linked
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.860]   to having to stay at the hotel.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.700]   I did a search.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.500]   There's more than 500 experiences around the country.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.340]   You get 10 points per dollar spent
[00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.360]   plus additional if you have a credit card from Hiatt.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.620]   I would say getting 10 Hiatt points per dollar
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.900]   on an experience,
[00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.460]   I probably value Hiatt points at like 1.5 or more cents.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.200]   That's like 15% cash back.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720]   So next time I'm looking to book an experience,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.400]   I'm definitely gonna take a look here.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.620]   Also feels a bit more curated.
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.640]   When you go to Viator, you go to Get Your Guide,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.860]   you go to Airbnb experiences,
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.220]   it can be a little bit overwhelming.
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.340]   This feels a little bit more curated.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.760]   I can't speak to the quality,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.220]   but it feels a little more curated, which I like.
