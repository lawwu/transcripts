[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.420]   Today, my guest is Tim Ferriss.
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.640]   Tim Ferriss is an author, a podcaster, an investor,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.400]   and is known for having a near supernatural ability
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.560]   to predict the future,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800]   which has allowed him to obtain success
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.480]   in a huge number of different endeavors.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.440]   For instance, he is a five-time
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.240]   number one New York Times bestselling author.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.160]   But perhaps equally or more important to that,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.480]   he's also exceptionally good at teaching people
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.800]   how to write, the entire process of writing
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.480]   and marketing a book.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.000]   His books, "The 4-Hour Chef" and "The 4-Hour Body"
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.360]   and "The 4-Hour Workweek,"
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.680]   not only explain his own exploration
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040]   of how to optimize and prioritize his time
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.680]   and learn particular skills,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.560]   but he teaches you those skills as well.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.400]   This is really what sets Tim apart.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.260]   He is an exceptional learner and an exceptional teacher.
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.240]   And today you learn why that is
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.680]   and in a characteristic Tim Ferriss way,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.720]   he explains the process in a way that you can apply it.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.920]   He lists out, for instance,
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.100]   the specific questions that you should ask
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.880]   when approaching any endeavor
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   in order to get the information that you want
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820]   and to make the process of learning
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.460]   and getting better at something
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520]   and achieving great success in something
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.200]   that much more likely.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.760]   That ability that Tim has
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.560]   to identify the specific questions
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.360]   that one needs to ask and answer
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.500]   and the specific action steps to take
[00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.120]   in order to achieve success
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.480]   is really what I believe sets Tim apart
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.800]   from everyone else on the internet or on the bookshelf
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.020]   that's giving advice as to how to become good at something.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.500]   Tim Ferriss is also dedicated
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.320]   to various philanthropic efforts,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.520]   the most recent of which is the donation
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.660]   of several millions of his own dollars
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.080]   to research on psychedelics for the treatment
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.780]   of otherwise intractable psychiatric challenges
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.220]   such as major depression, suicidal depression,
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.880]   eating disorders and addiction.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.280]   And he's also brought together other philanthropists
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.520]   which has really galvanized the whole field
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.160]   of psychedelic research for the treatment of mental health,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.820]   transforming it from what was recently
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.780]   kind of a fringe area of science
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.520]   to a mainstay that's actually funded
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.080]   not only by philanthropy
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   but by the National Institutes of Health.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.600]   So he's really transformed this entire scientific field
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.860]   into one that now is transforming the laws around psychedelics
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800]   and is providing mental health treatment
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.840]   for people that would otherwise suffer.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.500]   Today's discussion was a particularly meaningful one
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.000]   because not only is Tim a pioneer in the world of podcasting
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.760]   but it also marked the nine-year anniversary
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.180]   of his podcast, "The Tim Ferriss Show."
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.200]   Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.400]   Tim is known for being able to see around corners
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.280]   or predict the future.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.680]   He really does seem to be about five if not 10 years ahead
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.840]   of everybody else in thinking about tools for optimization
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   in particular domains of life.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.560]   And so we were very fortunate that during today's discussion
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.840]   he shares with us his current creative endeavors
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.280]   and how he's thinking about and approaching those.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.400]   And he also breaks down for us the process
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.640]   of how to think about and prioritize one's schedule.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   Not just on the order of the day,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.740]   not just on the order of the week,
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.400]   but really thinking about one's life as a journey
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.760]   and how to organize and go about that journey.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.240]   So today's discussion will provide with you
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   tremendous insight into who Tim Ferriss is
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.460]   and how that incredible mind of his works
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.620]   in order to do all the amazing things that he's done.
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.600]   And of course, he teaches you how to do it.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.280]   He will tell you the exact questions that you should ask
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400]   and that you should answer
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.720]   and how to step back and think about those questions
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.280]   and then prioritize so that you can decide
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.480]   how to best invest your time.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.400]   I'm sure many of you are familiar with "The Tim Ferriss Show."
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.360]   However, if you're not already subscribing
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.220]   to "The Tim Ferriss Show," I highly recommend you do.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.440]   I still go back and listen to early episodes
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.580]   of "The Tim Ferriss Show,"
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.640]   and I'm a weekly listener to the new episodes.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.420]   We provide a link to "The Tim Ferriss Show"
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.060]   in the show note captions.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.240]   Also in the show note captions,
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.360]   you'll find links to Tim's many
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.280]   New York Times bestselling books
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.780]   and a link to his excellent weekly blog.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.240]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.740]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.800]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.720]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.420]   about science and science-related tools
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.680]   to the general public.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.700]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.440]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.940]   Our first sponsor is Maui Nui Venison.
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.200]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient-dense
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.840]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.200]   I've talked before on this podcast
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   about the key importance of striving
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   to get one gram of protein per pound of body weight.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.180]   Now, when one strives to do that,
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.160]   it's also important to maximize
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.600]   the quality protein-to-calorie ratio.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.760]   In other words, you don't wanna consume
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.000]   a lot of extra calories
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.160]   in order to get your quality protein.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.360]   Maui Nui Venison, in having an extremely high-quality protein
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.560]   and nutrient-to-calorie ratio,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.480]   allows you to do that very easily.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.600]   And in addition to that,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.400]   Maui Nui Venison is delicious.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.020]   I particularly like their bone broth,
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.560]   which has an unmatched 25 grams of protein
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.480]   per 100 calories.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.340]   I also love their ground venison and their venison steaks.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.460]   All of them are absolutely delicious.
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.200]   If you'd like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.440]   go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.640]   and get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.160]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.960]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.360]   that has everything you need,
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.040]   that is the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.920]   but nothing that you don't, which means no sugar.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   It's critical that we get electrolytes
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.460]   because every cell of our body,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.460]   but in particular, our nerve cells, our neurons,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.240]   rely on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.040]   With Element, it's very easy to ingest the correct ratios
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.880]   of electrolytes.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.240]   They come in these little packets.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.080]   They're really delicious.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480]   You mix them up with anywhere from eight to 16
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.180]   to 32 ounces of fluid.
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.840]   I like mine pretty concentrated,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.680]   so I'll drink a 16 ounce glass of water
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240]   with Element in it when I first wake up.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.920]   I'll also consume another one of those,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   maybe 32 ounces with one packet when I exercise
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.400]   and maybe another one if I happen to sweat a lot
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.280]   during exercise or if I was in the sauna and sweating a lot
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.960]   if it's a very hot day, et cetera.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.720]   If you'd like to try Element, go to drink element,
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.360]   that's lmnt.com/huberman

[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.340]   Again, that's drink element, lmnt.com/huberman.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.200]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.620]   Levels is a program that lets you see how different foods
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.120]   and activities impact your blood glucose levels
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.240]   or blood sugar levels as they're sometimes referred to.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.200]   With Levels, you can see how the specific foods you eat,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.320]   when you eat, and exercise,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.960]   as well as any other activities impact your blood glucose
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.500]   and how those affect things like your energy level
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.320]   or your quality of sleep or your level of clarity and focus
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.940]   for mental work or your physical output
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.360]   for physical endeavors.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.420]   I first started using Levels about a year ago
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.500]   as a way to understand how different foods and activities
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.040]   impact my blood glucose levels,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.840]   and it's really impacted my entire schedule.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   In fact, I've shuffled a number of things around
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.700]   such that now I have more stable energy throughout the day.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.420]   Yes, I eliminated one or two foods.
[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.240]   Fortunately, they weren't my favorite foods.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.600]   I've also added some new foods to my nutrition program
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.200]   that have allowed my blood sugar levels
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.320]   to remain much more steady throughout the day
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   and to achieve better sleep at night.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.560]   Levels even provides a simple score after any meal you eat
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.260]   so you can see how different foods affect you
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.200]   and develop a personalized nutrition program
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.620]   that's exactly right for you.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.280]   And that's really what Levels is about.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.320]   It's really about tailoring things to your specific needs.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.180]   So if you're interested in learning more about Levels
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.280]   and trying a CGM yourself, go to levels.link/huberman.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   Right now, they're offering
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.140]   an additional two free months of membership.
[00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.940]   Again, that's levels.link/huberman.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.400]   And now for my discussion with Tim Ferriss.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.300]   Tim Ferriss, I am nothing short of thrilled
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.200]   to have you here.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.700]   I've been reading your books, reading your blogs,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.060]   listening to your podcasts for a very long time.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.660]   And in preparing for today, I was thinking,
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.220]   who does Tim remind me of?
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.060]   'Cause I knew you reminded me of somebody,
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.180]   but I didn't know who.
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.740]   And then I realized it.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.740]   You remind me of the neurobiologist Ramon Cajal.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.960]   You don't look anything like him.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.660]   He doesn't look anything like you.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.300]   He was a brilliant scientist.
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.820]   He won the Nobel Prize in 1906
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.900]   for essentially describing the structure
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.740]   of the nervous system.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.260]   He was the first, along with another guy,
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.540]   to define synapses, like this fundamental connection
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.540]   in the nervous system.
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.860]   But the reason that you remind me of Cajal
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.760]   is that it's a well-known or not so secret secret
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.620]   in neuroscience that if you want to pick
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.940]   a really excellent project to work on,
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.420]   you simply go and look at what Cajal talked about
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.260]   or hypothesized, and then you work on that.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.840]   You know, he had this almost supernatural ability
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.380]   to look at fixed stained tissue of the nervous system,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.300]   much of it is incredibly beautiful, by the way,
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.180]   and think about how it worked when it was alive.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.100]   And he's considered the greatest neurobiologist
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.360]   of all time, without question.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.260]   And it's really this feature of being able
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.300]   to see around corners or into the future
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.380]   that establishes that link for me.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.860]   It's absolute truth that if you look back
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.420]   to what you were doing 10 years ago, 15 years ago,
[00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.440]   the kinds of things you were doing,
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.380]   the kinds of questions you were asking,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.260]   that translates to much of what people like myself
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.520]   and people in the fitness space, tech space,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.240]   investor space, mindfulness space, psychedelic space,
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.260]   all these different arenas, what they're doing now.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.260]   So it's not hyperbole to say that you are the Ramon y Cajal
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.320]   of all those different spaces.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.260]   And podcasting, of course, is one of those.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.140]   So I owe you a great debt of gratitude
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.460]   and many others do as well.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.900]   So my first question for you is,
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.080]   what was your mindset around the time
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.160]   that you wrote "4-Hour Body," "4-Hour Workweek,"
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.600]   but in particular "4-Hour Body,"
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.540]   because the protocols in that book are so very useful.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.580]   They were at the time it was published.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.540]   They still are now.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.980]   And so many of the things like ice baths,
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.500]   the discussion around brown fat thermogenesis,
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.020]   resistance training in its kind of basic form
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.340]   of just providing enough progressive overload
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.420]   to get an adaptation, not excessively long workouts,
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.860]   weight loss, slow carb diet, and on and on and on.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.840]   What were you thinking at that time?
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.020]   Like if you can think back to then,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.540]   like what were you foraging for?
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.380]   What were you thinking about
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.260]   when you woke up in the morning?
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.580]   Think, oh, I'm going to go find all this stuff
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.940]   that at the time was really esoteric,
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.980]   because it is all played out very well.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.580]   What I'm basically saying is if you want to know
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.660]   what's going to be happening hot and useful
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.900]   in five years, 10 years, and onwards,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.380]   just look at what Tim's doing at any moment.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.380]   So there it is.
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.780]   - Well, thank you for the very generous comparison
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.620]   and intro.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.460]   I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.960]   So thanks for having me.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.120]   And "4-Hour Body" represented an opportunity
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.100]   for me to do a few things.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.020]   The first was to diversify my identity
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.580]   from outside of the realm of the, say, business category.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.980]   So it was a deliberate move
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.900]   since the success of the first book bought me permission
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:27.740]   to do something else
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.260]   that publishers would still want to gamble on.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.420]   I wanted to see if I could maybe like a Michael Lewis
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.740]   take my audience with me to other topics.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.140]   So that was a lateral move that was very deliberate
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.100]   from a career optionality standpoint.
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.180]   And then I was doing, I think,
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.740]   what I've done for a very long time and what I enjoy doing,
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.740]   which is looking at the most prevalent beliefs
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.140]   and maybe dogmatic assumptions in a given field.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.340]   Could be anything.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.500]   If anyone says always, never, should,
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.820]   I pay attention and take note of that.
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.420]   They may very well be right.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.320]   But if anything is said in absolutes,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.100]   I like to stress test.
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.820]   And in the case of, say, physical performance
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.460]   or physical manipulation, tracking,
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.200]   2008, 2009 was a very interesting time
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.220]   because a number of different technologies
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.540]   were coming online, meaning being adopted by small groups.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.700]   You had very early stages of, say, accelerometers
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.320]   as wearables.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.300]   You had a number of different innovations
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.560]   and means of tracking that had never been available before.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.720]   You had, for instance,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.540]   and this took a bit of ferreting on my side.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.820]   It wasn't immediately on the roadmap for our body,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.880]   but continuous glucose monitors.
[00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.780]   At the time, that was, I want to say, exclusively limited
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.820]   to type 1 diabetics, or maybe type 2 diabetics,
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.580]   but largely type 1 diabetics.
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.940]   And what captured my interest,
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.700]   and I can't recall how I came across it,
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.620]   but it was probably through the very earliest iterations
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.380]   of what later became the Quantified Self Movement.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.460]   And I remember attending the very first gathering
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.860]   at Kevin Kelly's house in Pacifica, California.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.860]   This was around 2009, 12 people, 13 people,
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.140]   to discuss quantifying health.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.140]   But the example of a professional race car driver,
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.780]   I can't remember the form factor,
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.060]   whether it was F1 or NASCAR or other,
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.860]   who was using this continual glucose monitor
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.860]   for paying attention to glucose levels while driving.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.760]   And I thought to myself,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.460]   would that not be useful for healthy normals?
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.500]   Would that not have other applications?
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.140]   If this is being used by a high performer
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.740]   in this type of context,
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.020]   might it have other types of applications,
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.700]   which then led me to use the very early versions of Dexcom,
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.380]   which were really painful to implant, no longer the case.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.140]   Of course, that's changed a lot.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.140]   And I wanted to see how I might be able to find a handful
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.260]   of different categories of things.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.280]   There's the new, like the genuinely new, like CGM,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.500]   at that point was genuinely new.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.500]   The very old that might have some room
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.540]   for scientific investigation.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.340]   And I would say, when I say scientific,
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.580]   I don't necessarily mean randomized control trials
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.480]   at a university.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.520]   I do think as an N of one,
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.040]   if you think about study design and you can even blind,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.380]   you could even placebo control.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.840]   And I knew people in the small subculture of quantified self
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.020]   who did this.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.240]   You can, I think, approach things in a methodical way
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.900]   where you can make a lot of progress
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.420]   in trying to determine causality or lack thereof.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.060]   Looking at very old things, looking at orphaned things.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.500]   So for instance, there are many examples
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.660]   in the world of doping, where you have, say,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.540]   Balco back in the day,
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.380]   where famously Barry Bonds and others
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.180]   purportedly used things like the cream and the clear.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.020]   And these were based on antibiotics that were sourced
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.900]   from Soviet literature or older literature
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.580]   from the '50s and '60s that might not be on the radar
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.180]   of, say, the anti-doping groups
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.860]   that would administer the testing.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.060]   So all of these different buckets were of interest to me.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.000]   And I begin where I usually do, which is interviewing folks.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.060]   So I would interview one or two people in a given field.
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.100]   And I might ask them any number of questions.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.840]   So one is, what are the nerds doing
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.900]   on the weekends or at night?
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.400]   This is also really good for investing.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.660]   It's like, all right, what are the really technical
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.980]   nerds doing at night or on the weekends
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.660]   after they've put in a really long workday or workweek?
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.900]   Let's take a really close look at that.
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.380]   Another one is, and I'll create a flow for this,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.780]   but what are rich people doing now?
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:03.500]   That everyone or tens or hundreds of millions of people
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.940]   might be doing 10 years from now?
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.220]   And an example of that would be, let's just say,
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.520]   full-time assistant, virtual assistant, AI, right?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.860]   So we've seen the needs and wants being addressed
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   by different technology, but it's an iteration
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.300]   of the same thing on some level,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.320]   in the case of, say, using ChatGPT tied into Zapier
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.100]   for various functions.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.740]   And then, where are people cobbling together awkward solutions?
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.740]   So where are people piecing together awkward solutions,
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.780]   and is there room for some type of innovation there?
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.940]   These are a few of the questions that I would
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.620]   not only ask myself, but ask experts in different areas.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.400]   So if I end up spending time, say,
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.400]   this was a few years prior to writing The 4-Hour Body,
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.740]   I spent time at NASA Ames and was interacting
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.620]   with a number of scientists, some people who were working
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.820]   on all sorts of biological tests and looking at genomics,
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.180]   and had a very frank discussion about where they thought,
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.640]   if they had to push, right, so I'll ask questions like,
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.220]   push a little bit into the realm of science fiction
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.820]   and speculation, because I'm sure you can't support
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.500]   any type of projection like that with the literature,
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.900]   with scientific literature, but what do you think
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.060]   some of the risks are of, say, publishing your genome?
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.860]   Because at the time, a number of high-profile folks
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.180]   had just made their full genomes available,
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.180]   and they're like, well, I think in the near future,
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.240]   it'd be possible to reconstruct someone's face
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.780]   based on their genetic data, and they're like,
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.020]   high degree of confidence, like zero to 100%, how confident?
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.340]   They're like, yeah, 80, 90%.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.400]   I'm like, okay, I should pay attention to that,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.060]   because if you're making your data available, let's just say,
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.260]   and it's anonymized per se, you still might be identifiable.
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.100]   So it's like, okay, that raises some interesting questions.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.340]   Like, okay, well then, how might you get around that?
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.980]   How might you put in safeguards so that you are the one
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.320]   and only keeper of your data, so to speak?
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.860]   Brought up all sorts of targeted weaponry,
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.220]   by sort of bio-weapons possibilities
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.920]   that I was interested in, and then I would ask that person,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.820]   who's clearly willing to step outside of the box
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   of whatever he's working on day to day,
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.500]   who are two of your close friends,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.140]   or two thinkers you really pay a lot of attention to,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.820]   or kind of at the bleeding edge of something,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.820]   and unorthodox, and then I would just continue
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.780]   to have these conversations over and over again.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.820]   And the stream of development
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:30.980]   that I paid a lot of attention to,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.100]   is something along the lines of the following.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.260]   So the very beginnings are usually
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.820]   in some type of extreme case, and I think the extremes,
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.240]   and this goes for product design as well,
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.900]   but the extremes inform the mean, but not vice versa.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.580]   So you can actually learn a lot by studying the edge cases.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.420]   So racehorses, for instance.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.780]   You'll often see things start with, say, racehorses,
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.640]   or people with wasting diseases, for instance,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.460]   or any type of chronic or terminal illness
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.420]   who are willing to try
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.060]   some more experimental interventions.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.540]   Then let's just take one step further, bodybuilding.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.920]   See a lot of interesting behavior in bodybuilding,
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.620]   and high-level athletes, then billionaires,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.900]   then rich people, then the rest of us, right?
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.260]   So my assumption is, and was for the 4-Hour Body,
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.740]   that along the lines of William Gibson's quote,
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.700]   the future is already here,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.540]   it's just not evenly distributed.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.260]   So I'm never predicting the future,
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.140]   I'm just finding the seeds that are germinating
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.740]   that I think are gonna bloom
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.480]   and end up spreading really, really widely.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.780]   So that's generally where I start,
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.940]   and I assume the practitioners
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.900]   are gonna be ahead of the papers.
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:46.180]   So studying, say, the coaches whose jobs are on the line,
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.080]   who are getting paid based on athlete performance,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.000]   and assuming that a lot of that will eventually,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.400]   if it holds up, make its way into, say,
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.420]   the peer-reviewed exercise science papers,
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.820]   but it's gonna have a lag time of three to five years.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:59.660]   - At least.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.860]   - At least, at least.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:01.700]   Takes a long time.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.600]   - Yeah, science is often very slow to catch up.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.360]   You've mentioned many things I have questions about.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.200]   You mentioned paying attention to the new,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.520]   the very old, or the orphaned.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.580]   So interesting, and I just thought I'd tell you
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.840]   that when you sit down with a graduate student
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.200]   or a postdoc and they're trying to come up with a project,
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.240]   rarely do you say, "What do you wanna work on?"
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.760]   And they fire back a really interesting question.
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.640]   Sometimes they do, but that's the rare person.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.000]   More often than not, you'll send them to the literature
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.900]   and they'll come back with like,
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.800]   "Okay, there's this new technique that we can use
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.460]   "to answer a set of questions better than ever before."
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.000]   Or, "There's a very old theory I wanna revisit."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.560]   Or, "There's this theory that no one pays attention to."
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.640]   In fact, we had one guest on here, Oded Rashavi,
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.000]   who is studying essentially inheritance of traits,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.580]   transgenerational inheritance of traits.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.200]   It's a little bit, although different,
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.800]   from Lamarckian evolution,
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.560]   but it's a lot like that in some ways.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.200]   And these orphan theories that everyone assumed were wrong
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.500]   and that there is a basis for them.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.640]   So I think there's real genius in that analysis.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.380]   It also struck me as you were listing off
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.420]   some of your process,
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.680]   circa the writing of the four-hour body,
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.800]   that I and many other people are probably curious
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.340]   about what the operations around all that looked like.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.780]   So are you, or were you at the time,
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.940]   like waking up in the morning and going,
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.760]   "Okay, I'm gonna take a walk and think about the new,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.000]   "the old, and the orphaned."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.860]   Or, "I'm gonna take a walk or sit in a chair
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.960]   "and think about like, what are the nerds doing right now?
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.400]   "What are rich people doing right now?"
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.540]   Or cobbling together awkward solutions.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.560]   Was that exploration a structured practice for you?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.840]   Or is this just something that was the consequence
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.700]   of being Tim Ferriss, waking up in the morning
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.480]   and just like leaning into that?
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.100]   Because I've experienced both, right?
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.160]   But I think a lot of us are curious.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.360]   I mean, there's a lot of mystique around you.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.080]   - I'll do my best to dispel it.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.520]   - Whether you like it or not, it's there.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.780]   And we're not trying to pry, but--
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.620]   - Pry away.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.240]   - Is the establishment of structure for you
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.780]   something that's the consequence of structure
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.620]   in the first place?
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.440]   It's like, "Okay, now it's time to think."
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.480]   Or do you just allow things to geyser up to the surface?
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.320]   - I do both.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.400]   And I would say that in the case of the four-hour body,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.320]   it's a bit of an anomaly compared to my later books
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.560]   because I had recorded effectively every workout
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.720]   I had done since age 16 as a competitive athlete.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.640]   I had a lot of records and I kept copious notes
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.360]   on supplement use and everything imaginable.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.280]   So I have what you might call hypergraphia.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.240]   I just capture almost everything in writing.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.380]   And that was very useful because at various points in time,
[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.120]   let's just say I looked at a photograph of myself
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.240]   from making this up, but 2004 and I think,
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.880]   "I would like to look and feel like that again.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.920]   "Okay, let me revisit my workout logs.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.300]   "Let me just replicate the preceding three to six months
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.500]   "of workouts and look at my intake and my diet at the time."
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.020]   And lo and behold, more or less,
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.300]   I could replicate the same type of look
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.980]   and feel and performance.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.120]   So I had a lot already logged that I thought
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.080]   was worth examining and putting under scrutiny,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.640]   trying to replicate with other people.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.800]   I do think replication is really important.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.640]   And then when it came time to commit to writing the book,
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.040]   I thought about what types of mini books
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.560]   would be of great interest to me personally.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.860]   And that book, like many of my other books,
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.720]   was written in such a fashion that it could be
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.380]   a choose your own adventure book.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.560]   Did not need to be read.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.200]   In fact, in many ways, it shouldn't be read linearly
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.060]   from page one to the end.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.200]   You get to pick and choose which chapters are of interest
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.000]   based on breath hold, vertical jump, endurance,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.040]   hypertrophy, cold exposure for fat loss,
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.080]   whatever it might be.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.620]   And then I began talking to people.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:14.620]   And at the very outer bounds of self-experimentation,
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:19.180]   at least in the Bay Area, it's a pretty small community.
[00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.440]   So you're one or two lily pads from just about everyone.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.840]   And it's not accidental that I put myself
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.480]   in that environment in San Francisco,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.200]   specifically and more generally in the Bay Area,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.440]   Silicon Valley, because there's just a high surface area
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.880]   for luck to stick to because you have
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.040]   so many serendipitous encounters.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.320]   You have so many people focusing on different disciplines.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   That I think was the fertilizer and the fertile ground
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.240]   for everything else was actually the choosing the where
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.160]   of writing, physically being located in San Francisco.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.220]   And then when I'm structuring things,
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.240]   maybe I'll get into some of the nitty gritty,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.680]   but I was using at the time,
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.820]   and I still like to use a program called Scrivener,
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.520]   which is actually designed predominantly for screenwriting.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.720]   It's used for many things now, novels and so on.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.480]   It's expanded its reach quite a bit,
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.440]   but it allows you to gather research
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.840]   and all of your documents and drafts
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.400]   so that you can move them around in very novel ways
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.780]   so that you can view say a split pane of your research
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.240]   and what you're working on simultaneously
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.020]   without having to toggle between a lot of different windows.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.520]   And I was very promiscuous in my gathering of data.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.300]   So I would gather from say the web using a web clipper
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.120]   from Evernote, which I was involved with as a company.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.240]   And basically without bias capture as much as possible,
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.600]   put three asterisks next to anything that I thought
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.040]   I really might want to revisit
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.720]   after I had read something a second time,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.920]   which I would always do.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.720]   Then I could control F to find just three asterisks
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.580]   because they don't occur much in normal writing,
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:05.240]   just like people, authors, writers will use TK,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.600]   meaning find such and such a date.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.040]   Data needs to be inserted later,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.560]   but I don't interrupt the flow of writing.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.400]   Let me put in TK
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.520]   because it doesn't really appear in natural English much.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.100]   In terms of structured thinking,
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.520]   the way I approached it was
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.840]   during that period of time in my life,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.720]   it was interviews, tracking people down,
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.700]   conversations, emails, reading.
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.660]   So ingestion, let's just say for the workday,
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.240]   then a break for training
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.480]   and actually using myself as the human guinea pig
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.240]   for various things that had surfaced
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.960]   that might be on the docket.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.640]   - Where were you training at that time?
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.760]   San Francisco is not famous for amazing gyms.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.460]   - It's not famous for amazing gyms.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:52.300]   At the time, I was training mostly at a climbing gym
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.140]   called Mission Cliffs.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.780]   They didn't have much, but they had barbells
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.040]   and they had kettlebells.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.240]   I also had in the walkway leading from the front door
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.000]   of the apartment I was renting, it was more of a house,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.500]   the front door all the way to the first set of stairs,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.460]   there were 30 kettlebells of various types.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.380]   And I was training for certification
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.560]   'cause I wanted to put myself on some type of deadline
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.360]   with accountability for that type of training
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.000]   to get a better understanding of it.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.460]   So I trained for a few hours.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.100]   I also had developed a friendship with Kelly Starrett,
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.500]   so San Francisco CrossFit,
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.420]   who I have tremendous amount of respect for.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.260]   - Likewise.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.460]   - On multiple levels. - He's terrific.
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.960]   And his new book.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.060]   - Yeah, Built to Move.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.460]   - His great book, he's so good.
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.200]   - Yeah, he really not only talks the talk,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.060]   but walks the walk and exemplifies
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.160]   many of the capabilities that he teaches,
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.380]   which I take seriously.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.500]   I like practitioners,
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.280]   not just the people with pretty theories,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.680]   although the theories are important,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.120]   I prefer to see someone who can actually
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.240]   put them into practice.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.440]   So Kelly served that function, certainly,
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.760]   and we're still very close friends.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.540]   And then after that, all right, shake off the cobwebs,
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.440]   get the body moving, get the brain moving, also eat,
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.740]   and then I would actually focus on synthesis.
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   So I would write generally from, let's call it 9 p.m.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.140]   or 10 p.m. through to 4 or 5 a.m.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.820]   And I would ride the wave if I happened to be in the zone.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.800]   If I weren't in the zone, I wouldn't force it,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.340]   and I would try to get more sleep.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:29.340]   But I have always performed best with my writing
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.520]   in those witching hours of, let's call it, 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   And my experience is that the writers I've interviewed,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.320]   the writer friends I've become close with,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.580]   if you look at when they made themselves,
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.260]   not necessarily what they do now, right,
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.160]   but what they did that eventually got them
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.280]   to escape velocity, they're almost always doing
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.400]   most of their writing very late at night
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.120]   or very early in the morning when the rest of the world
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.320]   or their social group is inactive.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.540]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.760]   - And I say wow because, of course,
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.200]   all of this was prior to the publication
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.440]   of Matt Walker's seminal book, "Why We Sleep,"
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.700]   which I really see as the book that shifted a lot of people,
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:18.240]   fortunately, from the "I'll sleep when I'm dead" mindset
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.600]   to really paying attention to it.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.360]   And I don't think Matt gets enough credit.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.320]   I mean, there's been a revision of a few points
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.280]   within that book, but the majority of it is just spot on
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.620]   and hyperlegitimate, so good.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.860]   And yet what you're describing is a schedule
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.200]   that starting to write at 9 p.m.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.540]   and finishing up around 4 a.m.,
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.080]   but you talked about research earlier that day
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.480]   and training and eating, so were there naps in there?
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   - I would sleep from, say, four to maybe 11 or 12,
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.800]   so I would be getting up later.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.980]   And I've had conversations with Matt about this,
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   and there are night owls and morning larks,
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.720]   and there are certainly differences in the code,
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.240]   meaning the genetics, but that worked very, very well for me
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.840]   for a very long time.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.680]   It is, however, a very challenging social schedule.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.840]   So once you have a significant other,
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.880]   and every girlfriend I've ever had is a morning person,
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.280]   if you wanna spend time together,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.040]   that schedule just does not work.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.400]   So I made compromises later for the social side of things.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.480]   But if you put a gun to my head and said,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.740]   "You need to write the best book humanly possible,
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.440]   "that is your only priority outside of some exercise
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.400]   "and fuel," I would follow the same schedule.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.200]   - I know several very successful podcasters,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.840]   Lex Friedman in particular,
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.640]   who I think he's trying to follow a more normal schedule now
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.080]   but he's pseudo-nocturnal, at least by my read.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.920]   And there are a couple other online content creators,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.440]   Derek from More Plates, More Dates,
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.040]   who's hyper-productive in his domain
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.800]   and is mostly nocturnal.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.120]   And then as you're describing your writing routine
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.980]   and your overall routine,
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.120]   I was thinking that the great skateboarder,
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.080]   everyone knows Tony Hawk,
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.380]   who is obviously a great skateboarder, no doubt about that.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.440]   But Rodney Mullen, who invented the ollie on street,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.720]   the kickflip, the ollie.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.200]   Rodney is basically nocturnal and has been for a long time
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.040]   and would skateboard up and down the boardwalk
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.420]   in Santa Monica in the middle of the night
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.960]   because lack of distraction, as it really was.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.800]   And he's been doing that since his teens.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.000]   I don't know what he's doing these days,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.920]   but I think a lot of creators just need space.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.240]   And I always wonder if that's because when they,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.280]   at least the ones that are not socially dysfunctional,
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.980]   like yourself, who, when they are around people,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.200]   there's this almost hopefully a desire to interact.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.620]   So you almost have to remove the stimulus completely.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.520]   - Yeah, it removes the plausible deniability,
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.600]   which might not be the perfect use of that phrase,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.400]   but in the sense that it's harder to fool yourself
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.120]   into thinking you're doing something important
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.920]   when you're checking your messages or social media
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.200]   at two in the morning.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.400]   Who are we kidding, folks?
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.800]   You should be writing in this case, right?
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.320]   And writers will do anything to avoid writing.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.000]   I remember Ayn Rand wrote a book about writing,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.220]   which is actually fantastic.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.320]   I can't remember the exact title.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.760]   It might just be on nonfiction writing, something like that.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.600]   And she talked about polishing the sneakers or the shoes
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.440]   before writing.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.160]   Like I really just need to do this one thing,
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.560]   which is to just clean up that shoe
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.240]   because somebody should really clean it up.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.040]   And at some point I should clean it up and therefore,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   why don't I just do, there's no time like the present.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.480]   I'll just do that and it's all to avoid writing,
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.980]   which is the harder thing.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.400]   And in my conversations with Matt also,
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   I should say that as someone who has self-described
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.620]   as a person who struggles with onset insomnia,
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.540]   Matt made the point, and sometimes we need
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.960]   to relearn things.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.720]   Maybe you should just go to bed later.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.520]   - Mm-hmm, sure.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.000]   - And that might address some of this onset insomnia.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.680]   And I don't know the causes for that,
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.480]   but I do get a second wind very late.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.120]   Could be related to some cortisol release abnormality
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.640]   or just different scripting in my system, who knows.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.800]   - I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.080]   one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.520]   Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.900]   is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.800]   that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.480]   I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.700]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.300]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.360]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.480]   once or usually twice a day is that it gets me
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.960]   the probiotics that I need for gut health.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.080]   Our gut is very important.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.200]   It's populated by gut microbiota that communicate
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.360]   with the brain, the immune system,
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.760]   and basically all the biological systems of our body
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.420]   to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.440]   And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.100]   and vital for microbiota health.
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.960]   In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.080]   of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.040]   that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.920]   And it tastes great.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.360]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.760]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.720]   and they'll give you five free travel packs
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.040]   that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.640]   while you're on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.040]   And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.720]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.100]   to get the five free travel packs
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.480]   and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.840]   - I'll mention one other maybe sure-istic that I use
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.180]   for trying to peek around corners,
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:33.180]   which is if I find an example of an outlier,
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.520]   trying to find two or three, right?
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.400]   Because one is an exception, two is interesting,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.840]   three is worth investigating.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.640]   That's sort of how I think about it.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.760]   And I recognize the plural of anecdote does not equal data.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.340]   However, a lot of interesting discoveries begin
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.260]   as case studies or case histories.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.820]   And so there are some things we could talk about
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.980]   that I've paid attention to over the last few years
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.540]   that are not in the four-hour body
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.860]   that I think are quite interesting
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:05.020]   and raise very, very exciting questions, but-
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.820]   - I'd love to hear about those.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.620]   And along the lines of what I call anecdata,
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.060]   I mean, most of what we know about human memory
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.180]   stems from one patient, HM, who had his hippocampi
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.120]   removed for epilepsy.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.740]   And of course, there've been millions probably,
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.380]   close to millions of studies in animals and humans
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.740]   focusing on the hippocampi,
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.220]   but most of what we know about human memory is from one guy.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.620]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:33.820]   So there's a lot to be examined.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.580]   Not all of it will get funding for RCTs.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.540]   Let's be realistic.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.980]   This is especially true if you're hoping
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.280]   for any type of directive data.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.820]   I notice I'm not saying conclusive,
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.380]   but if you are a human who's going to be making decisions
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.580]   about diet, health, exercise,
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.540]   if you want any consensus, you're doomed.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.620]   You'll be, you're not going to get any answers
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.460]   before you die.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.060]   - Can you say that twice so that the internet
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.940]   can hear it extra loud and clear?
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.220]   For those of you that are arguing about nutrition
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.660]   on Twitter, like it might actually be life-wasted.
[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.500]   - Yeah.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.600]   - I mean, I'm not being judgmental.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.320]   I mean, I think that there's validity
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.760]   in lots of those pockets.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.900]   There's stuff that's wrong in lots of those pockets.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.940]   There are diets that work extremely well,
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.220]   like, you know, four hour diet, or it's slow carb.
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.300]   I always call it the four hour diet,
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.940]   but the slow carb diet,
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:21.920]   it works extremely well.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.300]   Anytime I've followed it, you know,
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.020]   I get much leaner and stronger and all that stuff
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.980]   that it's purported to do, it works.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.220]   But yeah, maybe you could just explain
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.040]   what you mean by that,
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:38.380]   because I think there are some argument/friction spaces
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.140]   that are truly an energy sink.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:42.100]   - Yeah.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.060]   I would just say, focus on what works
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.240]   for you and your family or your team.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.740]   And if you're arguing on the internet,
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.100]   recognize that you're just doing it
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.500]   because you like arguing on the internet.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.900]   You're not gonna convince anyone of anything,
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:58.900]   and you're just gonna make yourself more frustrated
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.620]   if you plan on changing any opinions.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.260]   So for me, it's live and let live.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:11.260]   And the more people who engage in that type of behavior,
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:14.580]   the more competitive advantage you have if you don't.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.340]   So for me, I'm like, okay,
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.700]   if you wanna spend this vital non-renewable resource
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.900]   of yours called time on that,
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.440]   if I ever compete against you, I'm gonna win.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.700]   So great, I'll also not even try to convince you
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.460]   to stop doing that unless you see the logic in it,
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.140]   which I have, which is why I also don't have,
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.140]   at least for two years,
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.180]   have mostly had no social apps installed on my phone.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:41.060]   And we could talk about that because I think recognizing
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.260]   that these things have been engineered
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.680]   to overcome any type of self-discipline
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.440]   with billions of dollars (laughs)
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.520]   at stake should lead you to believe
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.440]   that you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.500]   So I just don't have the apps on my phone to begin with.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.060]   And I find it much more gratifying
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:03.060]   to see disproportionate change from small inputs.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.060]   So that's what I'm looking for.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.060]   And I'm also looking for changes that are easy to make
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.840]   that can have high adherence, that have very limited downside
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.720]   which is very different from proving something.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.800]   For instance, in the "For Our Body" took a look
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:26.160]   at the potential effect of cell phones
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.760]   or the proximity of cell phones
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.760]   to say, gonadal function and reproductive health.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.880]   And the literature that was available at the time
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.680]   was very limited, had some animal studies,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.920]   mice, rats, et cetera.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:44.060]   I recognize humans are not just large mice,
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:45.600]   so they don't always translate.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.020]   But I looked at it and I said, okay,
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.780]   looking at this simplistically,
[00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.040]   is it plausible that there could be similar effects
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.120]   on humans seems to be the case also based on conversations
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.980]   with people who are specialists
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.600]   but would never go on record.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.200]   Therefore, if your phone is in your pocket,
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.620]   just have it on airplane mode.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.120]   I mean, it does not have a high cost.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   And then pending any revision, we can see,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.640]   but while the jury is still out,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.960]   I'm going to risk mitigate by taking this step.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.360]   - Well, and I just want to say thank you there too.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.200]   I read that recommendation.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.280]   I followed the recommendation of not keeping the phone
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.900]   on in my front pocket or back pocket.
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.160]   And that's anecdotal data.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.980]   My sperm analysis isn't relevant to this conversation,
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.620]   but worked out, but you could say, well,
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:40.420]   that's not necessarily because you had the phone off,
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.460]   but I did a very long detailed episode
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.180]   on male and female fertility.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:49.800]   There is now what I view as a really quality meta analysis.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.620]   And it's pretty clear that there are effects
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:56.460]   of the smartphone on proximity of the smartphone
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.340]   when it's turned on that are not good for sperm,
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.280]   isn't necessarily going to render somebody sterile,
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.240]   but on sperm that can be separated out
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.720]   from the heat effects.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.500]   And so essentially this is another instance
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.160]   in which you were right.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.380]   And I think more data will come out
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.840]   and am I a EMF conspiracy theorists?
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   No.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.200]   Do I wear tinfoil underwear?
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   No, but I think it's interesting.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.280]   I think it's important.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.600]   And thanks to you, cued my attention to it.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.080]   In fact, I teach about that in a course
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.880]   on neural circuits and biology and health and disease.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.920]   - Amazing.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.280]   And I don't expect to get everything right at all.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.960]   That would be crazy.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.120]   I'd like to think I'm not totally crazy.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.200]   And it's very important
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.640]   if you are going to do self experimentation
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.440]   or experimentation in small groups,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.200]   which the quantified self community did quite well.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.840]   And I think still does quite well.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.840]   You should really make every effort to not fool yourself,
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.800]   which is hard.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.500]   It's challenging at times,
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.920]   but read books like "Bad Science."
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.360]   Read books like "How to Lie with Statistics."
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.140]   Ensure that you are able to read studies well.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.820]   You don't have to be the best in the world,
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.880]   but that you can on some level identify the strengths
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.120]   and weaknesses of studies.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.720]   This doesn't take a long time.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.840]   Certainly our friend Peter Attia,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.840]   Dr. Peter Attia has "Studying the Studies,"
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.960]   which is a multiple part blog series dedicated to this.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.280]   There are other ways to approach it.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.480]   I took one of his podcasts,
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.200]   republished it on "The Tim Ferriss Show,"
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.760]   because it talked about how to examine studies,
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   what powering refers to, things like this.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.120]   In the span of one or two weeks,
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.740]   you could really become literate
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:49.040]   with the building blocks of scientific literacy
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.800]   with respect to reading studies.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   And that gives you such an enormous life advantage.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.360]   It's hard to overstate.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.200]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.520]   And I also think that there are a lot of things
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.280]   that just simply will not ever be explored
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.800]   in a randomized control trial.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.580]   One of the things that Peter and I have talked about before
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:10.980]   is he texted me, "What are your thoughts on BPC-157?"
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.720]   This is a gastric peptide that's now been synthesized,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.560]   so people will inject it into a tissue
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.980]   that they're trying to heal or improve.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:22.460]   Lots and lots of anecdotal data on BPC-157,
[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.900]   making injuries heal faster, et cetera.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.900]   Again, anecdotal data.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.740]   I've used it.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.180]   I took an injection of it yesterday, in fact.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:35.540]   Peter basically is not a believer
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.980]   because there is a lack of published data on this,
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980]   which is perfectly fine.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.900]   Or I should say he's skeptical.
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.020]   And so there's always that possibility of a placebo effect.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.940]   But I don't think there will ever be
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.940]   a really nice controlled trial on BPC-157
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.060]   because the financial incentives aren't there
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.020]   and no smart graduate student
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.940]   is going to go do a thesis on this.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.820]   So that's the reality.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.220]   I mean, maybe one will do it now
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.460]   that we're having this conversation,
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.060]   but it just doesn't, the payout isn't there.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.180]   - And that last one you mentioned
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   is one that people miss a lot.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.340]   People doing these studies are people with careers
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.060]   who are planning their careers.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.960]   And so they choose what they're going to invest time in
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.100]   very carefully.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.060]   So that's another limiter on what will end up
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.980]   in an RCT or not, right?
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:24.500]   So I think that's good for people to hear.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.860]   And as you get more involved with science,
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.700]   and in my case, through a foundation,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.100]   the Sci-Safe Foundation funding
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.140]   a lot of early-stage science,
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.980]   you realize how expensive it is and how long it takes.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.500]   It is a long-term investment.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.420]   And if you are looking to make behavioral changes
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.020]   or modify aspects of yourself,
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.580]   cognitive, physical, psycho-emotional, or otherwise,
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.780]   identifying interventions or options
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.620]   that seem to have some plausible upside,
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.620]   like there is a mechanism that might make sense in humans.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.780]   If you feel fairly certain there's very limited downside,
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.820]   which should include talking to people
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.660]   who are presenting their results as anecdotal,
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.100]   then maybe you consider using X if you can cap your downside.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:20.420]   And I recall, for instance, looking at trans-resveratrol,
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.940]   specifically not for longevity,
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.020]   but in potentially increasing endurance for our body.
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.400]   And I ended up testing it,
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.940]   and there's a funny story associated with that.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.300]   Didn't quite work out as planned,
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.540]   and I don't use it any longer.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:40.220]   But what I experienced prior to actually finding this
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:43.700]   on forums was joint pain, elbow pain.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.940]   The one most consistent side effect
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.820]   was what felt like tendinosis in the elbows.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.700]   And then I went online, and I'd already done this,
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.940]   but I hadn't come across, I think it was the 500 group.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.780]   People had been using 500 milligrams
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.740]   of trans-resveratrol daily for long periods of time.
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.900]   And one of the most common reported side effects
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.740]   was joint pain.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.780]   And I was like, okay, I'm not willing to make that trade-off.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.980]   - Yeah, makes sense to me.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.220]   - Yeah.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.140]   - I think it would be fun if ever you were willing
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.880]   that we could do a hybrid podcast on supplement fails.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.060]   [laughing]
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.740]   - I have some spectacular failures.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.800]   - As do I.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.740]   And I'm thinking about a few of them.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.240]   I mean, some that were really, like took me off course,
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.140]   like there's one supplement called Bulbine Natalensis.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.340]   This is another one of these shrubs.
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.820]   - Sounds like an infection.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.220]   - I mean, this thing will really spike your testosterone
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.100]   and free testosterone.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.240]   I'm talking back acne, like huge strain gains, aggression.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.340]   It's really wild.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.340]   And then after about seven to 10 days,
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.300]   it all crashes and you go below baseline.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.140]   - Oh, sounds terrible.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.220]   - Yeah, even testicular pain.
[00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.060]   So it was unclear.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.300]   So if you're a smart person, you halt use, right?
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.260]   So I can understand why people are skeptical
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.080]   of certain things.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.240]   And then of course there are supplements
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.180]   that I'm a big fan of and that you're a big fan of.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.580]   We talked about those things elsewhere,
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.140]   but it might be fun to do a supplement fails podcast.
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:09.980]   If ever you're willing, that would be--
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.540]   - Oh, I could do just experimental fails.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.380]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.980]   - Yeah, end of one experimental fails,
[00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.100]   which include things that people might not think about.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.680]   For instance, "For Our Body" had quite a bit
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.220]   of real estate dedicated to looking at things like PRP,
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.460]   so platelet-rich plasma.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.460]   I think there's a role for it.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.900]   It's not useful for everything,
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:32.600]   but for certain types of injury or repair,
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.940]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:39.460]   But every time you get injected,
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:40.500]   this is where you have to be careful
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.660]   because there are very few free lunches out there.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:46.180]   There's usually some type of feedback loop.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.980]   Your system is very smart at auto-regulating things.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.180]   This is outside of that, a consideration that I hadn't made,
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.100]   which is every time you have an injection,
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.540]   there's a chance of an infection,
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.180]   particularly if the site, in my case, was the elbow,
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.420]   and the injection was made for the PRP,
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.160]   not quite where it should have been,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.300]   slightly to the rear of the elbow
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.740]   where the skin is very thick.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   And so it pushed staph bacteria
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.660]   from a mid-layer of the skin into the joint capsule.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.500]   - Not good.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.620]   - And that really could have ended very poorly.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.100]   I ended up having to go to the ER
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.460]   and get it all removed and so on,
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.340]   but that could have ended up
[00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:33.260]   in a much, much more severe situation.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.380]   So you do have to be careful with this stuff.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.420]   I've become a little more conservative
[00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:40.440]   with some of what I do, including injections.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.540]   I'm like, all right, let me think twice
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.940]   about the injections.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:45.980]   If I'm gonna swallow something,
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.400]   let me make sure I'm really looking
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.760]   at the implications for the liver.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.340]   - Yeah, smart, very smart.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.020]   I'm curious about some of the things
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.700]   that you talked about in the four-hour body
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:57.900]   and that you've mentioned today,
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:02.400]   things like accelerometers, continuous glucose monitors,
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.780]   deliberate cold exposure.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.500]   How many of those things are you still doing
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.980]   on a regular basis?
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.500]   And how many do you use a couple of times a week
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.460]   or a couple of times a month
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.500]   or go through phases of using and not using?
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.240]   - Cold exposure I use as consistently as is practical.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.020]   So if I'm traveling, it's a little harder,
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.920]   but we're in LA right now.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.260]   One of the first things I did was find a few options
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.560]   for contrast therapy, one of the first things I did.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   And by contrast, I do not mean infrared sauna
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.880]   and cold plunge, I'd much rather have hot and cold water,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.100]   just in terms of sort of speed of heating.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.500]   - The Japanese approach.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.960]   - Right, for just speed of vasodilation,
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.780]   particularly for injury recovery,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.260]   I think it's incredibly helpful.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.340]   For mood regulation, certainly that's the case.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.020]   And cold water for mood regulation
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.980]   or the treatment of, say, depression
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.760]   or as a preemptive intervention to avoid
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.140]   or mitigate depression is old.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:06.340]   Used to be prescribed for melancholy.
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.620]   And people like the Van Goghs of the world
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:10.860]   would be prescribed cold baths.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.700]   So that was something I was like,
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.820]   well, let's take a look at some of the old history,
[00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.300]   read about that, and then look into PubMed and so on
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.100]   to see what might be supported.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.780]   So the cold, I'm still using.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.220]   I've become increasingly interested,
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.460]   this was not in the four-hour body,
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.580]   but whole body hyperthermia,
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.580]   often excluding the head for depression,
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:34.000]   which I know there's some research.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.060]   - Yeah, at UCSF right now.
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.740]   Yeah, really interesting studies, too early to report.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.700]   I'm not involved in these,
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.760]   but I think these are really important studies
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.620]   because for all the people saying,
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.580]   oh, well, it's ice bath stuff, metabolism this,
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.740]   metabolism that, one thing that's very clear
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.780]   is long-lasting, very significant increase
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.940]   in the catecholamines, dopamine epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.700]   Not a replacement perhaps for antidepressant medication,
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.260]   but as you said, to move the needle
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.860]   toward antidepressant states, that's the cocktail.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.180]   And heat as well.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.340]   - Yeah, yeah, and the hyperthermia,
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.980]   especially the way it is formatted right now
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.580]   with some of the research is very early stages.
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.340]   There's going to be less adherence.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.580]   It's not as readily available,
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.140]   say a cold shower or cold bath.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.980]   So I do think about the practical implications of that,
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.020]   but right now it's very interesting.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.000]   Slow carb diet, still use it all the time.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.660]   It is not my default 24/7 as it used to be.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.640]   So maybe I'm just getting older and more self-indulgent,
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.380]   but if I find myself going off the rails a bit
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.820]   and I'm like, okay, I'm getting closer to muffin top here,
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.560]   let's stage an intervention,
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.100]   then I will go immediately back to slow carb diet.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   And within a matter of weeks, it's pretty easily corrected.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.220]   - Just a cue for people.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.740]   I know that slow carb diet achieved great prominence.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.100]   In fact, wasn't it featured on or mentioned
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.420]   in an episode of Orange is the New Black?
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.700]   - I think it might've been.
[00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.740]   It's made appearances on a handful of shows.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.640]   - Great, I realize that I've been referring
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.620]   to the slow carb diet several times
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.960]   throughout this discussion.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.900]   So for those that aren't familiar with the slow carb diet,
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.300]   I know they can go look up what that is,
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.200]   but so that we can keep them here
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.400]   for the rest of this discussion
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.680]   and not have to send them out and back just yet.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.360]   Could you give us just a brief top contour
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.800]   of what the slow carb diet is?
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:24.180]   - Sure, the slow carb diet is intended
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.140]   to be a simple, easy to adhere to diet
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.780]   for people who have perhaps failed other diets
[00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:34.160]   that allows you to recompose your body.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.660]   So improve muscle mass, decrease, body fat percentage,
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.680]   and the rules are really simple.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.060]   And that's part of what makes it work.
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.300]   It's not ideal for every sport and every circumstance,
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.660]   but broadly speaking, it works for a lot of people
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.340]   who've had trouble with dieting in the past.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.460]   So rule number one, don't drink calories.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:56.820]   That's it, very simple.
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.420]   So black coffee, unsweetened tea, great.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.880]   Juice, out.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.020]   Anything with calories, out.
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.500]   You could add a little bit of heavy cream to your coffee,
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.180]   let's say, but that's also bending the rules
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.180]   in a way that I don't like.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.940]   So in the beginning, it's like follow the rules
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.860]   so you can break them later.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.300]   So in the beginning, let's just say
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.900]   you can't drink calories.
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.620]   Number two, don't eat anything white.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.620]   Sounds pretty basic, right?
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.500]   Just don't eat anything that is the color of white
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.740]   or that could be white.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.780]   Basically that means you're gonna be avoiding starches
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.140]   and things that are similar to starches.
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:30.860]   - That includes things like oatmeal.
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.300]   - That includes things like oatmeal.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.340]   So roughly speaking, just avoiding things that are white
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.300]   or that could be white will get you pretty far.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.640]   And yes, there are exceptions, like cauliflower, fine.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.780]   You can have cauliflower.
[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.560]   But again, don't get fancy, right?
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.540]   It's very easy to outsmart yourself
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.200]   when it comes to behavioral change.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.700]   Keep it simple.
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.160]   So for at least two weeks, forget about the exceptions.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.920]   Don't drink calories.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.940]   Don't eat anything white.
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:01.740]   And then eat 30 grams of protein
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.300]   within 30 minutes of waking up.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.980]   Okay, we got that.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:09.620]   And then there are a few buckets you can choose from, right?
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:13.620]   So you have vegetables, beans and lentils,
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.480]   and then some type of protein.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.400]   So you're going to come up with meals
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.840]   that you can follow without deviating
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.220]   for a period of one or two weeks.
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.760]   Just come up with the same meals.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.960]   And that's gonna sound boring, yes, but guess what?
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.020]   You do it already.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:30.940]   You just might not realize it.
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:35.940]   And the lentils and the beans specifically as a prereq,
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.760]   we can get into some of the reasons,
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.180]   but add a lot of fiber and also inhibit appetite, right?
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.240]   So that's actually a very important component
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.080]   of these meals.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.480]   And there may be a handful of other rules,
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.680]   but those are the basics.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.680]   And then the redemption is take one day off per week
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.360]   and just go fucking crazy.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.820]   That's cheat day.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.580]   There are some epic cheat days out there.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.880]   Some I've captured for myself and anything goes.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.060]   When I say anything, I do mean anything.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.900]   So if you want to consume multiple pizzas,
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:11.260]   pints of ice cream, whatever, indulge.
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.000]   Ah, I left one out.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.380]   No fruit during the week.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.640]   So avoid fruit, avoid fructose.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:21.320]   So agave nectar, anything that is sort of hidden sugar,
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   avoid all that.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.300]   So no added sweeteners, obviously,
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.800]   but avoid fruit and fructose.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.360]   And again, it's not gonna kill you.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.200]   Guess what?
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.800]   If you're from a European ancestry,
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:36.880]   your ancestors did not have like blueberries
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.680]   in the middle of winter, generally speaking, right?
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:41.100]   So you'll be fine for a few weeks.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.460]   And then there's that cheat day.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:45.060]   And cheat day anything goes.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.540]   The amount of damage you can do on cheat day
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.420]   is pretty limited.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:50.180]   And there are ways you can mitigate that.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.180]   There's a whole chapter called damage control
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.140]   in Before Our Body.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:57.740]   But focusing just on that diet and having one day off
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.220]   where you know you can do anything
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.500]   means when you're controlling yourself
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.580]   for those six days of the week,
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.580]   you're not giving up your favorite foods forever.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.220]   You can even keep a list of all the things
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.700]   you wanna eat on cheat day.
[00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.020]   And then you have free license to eat on cheat day.
[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:16.120]   And that provides you with a release valve
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.020]   so that you can build in the cheating
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.520]   as opposed to having it occur as a failure point.
[00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.980]   And there are a handful of other things there.
[00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.440]   If you have domino foods in the house, for instance,
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:30.200]   if you eat a lot of almonds or mixed nuts
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.680]   and you're just gonna sit there compulsively eating them
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.400]   while you're sitting at your laptop,
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.780]   don't have what I call domino foods in the house,
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:38.820]   which are going to really create
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.880]   some portion control issues.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.100]   But broadly speaking, don't drink calories.
[00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:44.220]   Don't eat things that are white.
[00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:46.460]   Take from three categories and build your meals out.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:48.580]   And those are the meals that you follow.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:53.580]   Do not eat fruit or fructose and then cheat one day a week.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:57.100]   And Saturday's a nice day for cheat day for most folks.
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.820]   And just to answer some questions people are gonna have,
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.360]   no, that doesn't mean 24 hours
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:03.180]   that you can spread out over two days.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.720]   That will actually set you back.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.260]   But the amount of fat that you can store
[00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.180]   in a handful of sittings over 24 hours,
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:16.320]   which legitimately is more like 12 to 18 hours,
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.160]   pretty limited.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:19.520]   So that's Slow Carb Diet.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.620]   - Great, thank you for that.
[00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.620]   I also wanna ask, is it okay to take the day
[00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:30.940]   after cheat day and fast or do one meal that day?
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.320]   When I followed the Slow Carb Diet,
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.460]   I benefited from it tremendously.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.340]   Lost fat, gained muscle, tons of energy, sleeping great,
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.220]   required less caffeine, all sorts of wonderful things.
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.920]   Stable blood sugar, I felt so, so good.
[00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.440]   Really enjoyed the cheat days.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.320]   I really, really enjoyed the cheat days.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.440]   So much fun.
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:50.300]   At some point, there's some gastric distress
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:53.440]   that comes from not regulating intake,
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.880]   which led me to not want to eat the next day.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.720]   So I tended to do the cheat days on Sunday in my case.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.600]   And then I would fast most of Monday,
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.340]   just water, black coffee, tea,
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.720]   and then I might have a small meal in the evening.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.440]   And then by Tuesday, I was back on the Slow Carb Diet.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.400]   Does that seem like a sort of a detrimental deviation
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.540]   from the plan?
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:21.040]   - I think that if that is what works for you,
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.860]   then that is what works for you.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:27.080]   So the Slow Carb Diet template for me is a starting point.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.560]   And generally I'll say, I think this is from Picasso, right?
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.940]   It's like, learn the rules as an amateur
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.680]   so you can break them as a professional.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.540]   But it's like, I recommend most people
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.540]   kind of stick with the format for a handful of weeks
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.720]   and measure the results, right?
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:46.600]   So there are guidelines for how to measure.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:49.120]   The scale is a bit of a blunt instrument,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.240]   so there are other ways.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.620]   But if you're extremely overweight,
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:53.440]   you can just use the scale.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.000]   And fasting, I think, is fine.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.480]   Or just ratcheting back
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.340]   your caloric consumption significantly.
[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.020]   And what happens over time for most people also
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.880]   is for the first, say, four weeks on cheat day,
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.320]   you're gonna go completely insane.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.120]   And I remember I was doing something much stricter
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.960]   called the cyclical ketogenic diet,
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.320]   which is a whole separate thing.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.920]   It's much more limiting in terms of what you can eat.
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:22.880]   But I was training for, ultimately,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.640]   the nationals in Chinese kickboxing.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.840]   This was happening in '99.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:28.520]   So I was training super hard.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.740]   I was following a cyclical ketogenic diet,
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.880]   which meant I could eat very few things.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.980]   But I did have this one cheat day.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:37.940]   And I would do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand,
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:39.020]   which is one of the things you can do
[00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.100]   to limit the damage on cheat day.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.080]   Do a glycogen depletion workout beforehand,
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.700]   and then I would just go crazy.
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.280]   I mean, I would drive to like Krispy Kreme,
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:50.060]   buy 12 donuts, and they would be gone
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.020]   by the time I got home.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.040]   And it wasn't an hour away.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.780]   It was like a 10-minute drive.
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:54.720]   Donuts would be gone, right?
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.500]   I would go to Safeway,
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.860]   and I would buy a bag of those fun-sized Snickers,
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.240]   and that would be just a tiny portion of my calories.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.520]   - Sweet stuff for you, huh?
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.800]   - A lot of sweet stuff.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.200]   I also did the savory stuff.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.340]   I mean, I had my favorites.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.700]   - Nothing was safe. - Pizza.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:10.840]   - Nothing was safe. - Nothing was safe.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.420]   - Nothing was safe.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:14.900]   My paws got into everything.
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:16.520]   And then over time, because the next day
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.580]   you're gonna feel like you got hit
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.720]   by a diabetic dump truck,
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.500]   you start ratcheting back.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.020]   And you're like, okay, maybe I don't need to do that.
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.020]   Maybe cheat day will just be two meals.
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:28.900]   Or maybe cheat day will just be like the pastries
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.100]   in the morning with the coffee.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.700]   And you start to regulate a bit, generally.
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.940]   You don't have to, but over time you generally will.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.880]   And I think after you've followed it to the T,
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.140]   just follow the commandments for, say, four to eight weeks,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:47.300]   then you can certainly deviate.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.380]   And I'm not saying if you're not hungry, don't eat.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:52.080]   However, in many cases, people have,
[00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:57.660]   they have acclimated to not eating in the morning,
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.500]   and then they end up overeating later in the day.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.900]   If you have that habit, right,
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.140]   if you're consuming 50% of your calories or more at dinner,
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.260]   and you want to lose body fat,
[01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:13.340]   I would say get some cottage cheese or something
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.440]   that will give you 30 grams easily in the morning.
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.460]   Worst case scenario, use a protein of some type.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.260]   Just don't make it hyperchloric.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.660]   - You mean powdered protein?
[01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.100]   - It could be powdered whey protein.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.800]   Whole food is gonna do a lot more.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.660]   - And no calorie counting, correct?
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.140]   - No calorie counting.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:32.540]   It tends to be self-limiting.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.100]   When you're eating this much fiber and this much protein,
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.740]   it tends to be very self-limiting,
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.660]   what you'll want to consume and what you can consume.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:44.660]   - Once again, I had great experiences with slow carb diet,
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.200]   and I'm gonna go back on.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.040]   - Yeah, and nobody needs to buy anything to figure it out.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.800]   If you just search on tim.blog, slow carb diet,
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.520]   you'll get everything that you need to get started.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.160]   No purchase necessary.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.320]   - Well, it works very, very well, I'll say that.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.000]   And it's very straightforward to follow,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.480]   and it does include the notorious cheat day,
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.880]   or infamous cheat day.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.000]   And it can be done on a very reasonable budget.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.200]   And so if people want to learn more about that,
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.600]   they should go to Tim's blog on 4-Hour Body
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.000]   and Slow Carb Diet, we'll provide a link.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.360]   But I think it's worth highlighting again,
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.400]   just how effective that is.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.560]   As you pointed out, thousands and thousands of people
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.200]   using it to great success, some of whom were quite obese.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.500]   And yeah, any updates on those folks?
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:37.720]   Are they still keeping the weight off?
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.060]   - I would like to do a follow-up.
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:43.420]   I think with diets in general,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.760]   there's a lot of reversion to the mean,
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.600]   regression to the mean.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.040]   So I would expect that some have kept it off
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.880]   and some have not.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.440]   That would be true of, I think, every possible diet,
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.640]   especially for people who are overcoming behavioral inertia
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.980]   of having gained hundreds of pounds.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.880]   But I'd like to do some follow-up.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.800]   What was fun about the post I put together
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.000]   called How to Lose 100 Pounds on the Slow Carb Diet,
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.300]   we had, we profiled, say, four or five people,
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.500]   but there were dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens,
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.880]   and this was a very long time ago.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.640]   So I would say that a long-term follow-up
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.800]   would be super interesting.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.580]   And we did, at one point, track several thousand people
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.680]   through a platform at the time, I think it was coach.me,
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.960]   as they followed the Slow Carb Diet
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.400]   for the first four to 12 weeks.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.680]   And that was fascinating, 'cause I want the data.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.080]   And I'm happy to be proven incorrect
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.140]   with any of my assumptions.
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.680]   I mean, I don't view that as a failure.
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.760]   I mean, I view that as a huge net gain.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.640]   And it has a very high adherence rate.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.460]   So I pay attention to not just is something effective,
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.520]   does it get you the outcome you want?
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.280]   Not only is it efficient
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.340]   from a time and resource perspective,
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.960]   but how high is the adherence rate?
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.600]   If you take a random sampling of 1,000 people from the US
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.920]   across socioeconomic classes, et cetera,
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.880]   how many people, practically speaking,
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.040]   will be able to or willing to follow this
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:14.160]   for say an eight week period of time or four week period
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.000]   of time?
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.540]   And I try to optimize for the widest adherence,
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.280]   because I know the Slow Carb Diet, people come on,
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.080]   they're like, what about intermittent fasting?
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:22.920]   What about this?
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.760]   And what about endurance athletes?
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.400]   I'm like, this is not for everybody in all cases.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.040]   It just happens to be a good default diet
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.720]   with a high adherence rate.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.560]   And like you said, it's very inexpensive.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.400]   It can be followed very, very inexpensively.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.240]   - Sorry to interrupt you.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.880]   One thing that I really like about it is that
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.720]   many variants on caloric restriction,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.840]   which is 'cause laws of thermodynamics definitely apply.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.320]   We're not trying to say they don't.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.540]   But one of the issues with a lot of things,
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.920]   including intermittent fasting,
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.280]   which I sort of do some variant of,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.680]   'cause I'm not really hungry to eat until about 11.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.480]   I like to train in the morning if I can, et cetera,
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.500]   is that they can sometimes prevent best performance
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.380]   in terms of, especially resistance training,
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.600]   high intensity resistance training.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.680]   So very low carb diets, I've tried them.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.120]   Even if you're paying attention to other ways
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.000]   to restock glycogen, performance drops off.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.720]   Whereas a slow carb diet, I feel like I can think,
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:20.560]   I can work, I can exercise, I can sleep.
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:21.760]   Everything just works well.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.520]   But there's one thing in it that I wanted to raise
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.920]   that when I heard this, I thought,
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.360]   there's no way this is true,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.780]   which was making sure that you get 30 or so grams of protein
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.720]   within 30 minutes of waking.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.280]   And I thought, how can that be?
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.180]   How can adding protein early in the day
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.020]   actually make a difference?
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.240]   And it really did work.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.520]   I still track my numbers.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.960]   So in terms of dropping body fat percentage,
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.080]   increasing muscle, it really does work.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.000]   Now, whether or not that's simply
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.820]   because it's offsetting food intake
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:49.920]   that I would have, food that I would have taken in
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.180]   later in the day, I don't know.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.940]   I'm not going to make myself my own control experiment
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.120]   to the point that I drive myself crazy,
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.360]   but it really does work quite well
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.920]   to get past sticking points,
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.720]   to just get that 30 grams of protein early.
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:06.440]   So sort of violate the time-restricted feeding component
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.820]   deliberately with some protein in the morning,
[01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.740]   then still train and do all the other things
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.700]   and carry on as usual.
[01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.460]   And it seems so peculiar,
[01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.520]   like eating more and losing body fat, but it works.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:20.140]   - Yeah, it's counterintuitive.
[01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:23.080]   And a lot of approaches can work
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.020]   for a lot of different people, right?
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:26.280]   To state the obvious.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.220]   But this particular aspect of this low carb diet
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.740]   is helpful for, let's just say,
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.260]   the majority of the people in that 1,000-person sample
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.180]   I was talking about, the hypothetical pull
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.820]   from different parts of, say, the US or anywhere,
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.960]   because it seems to help with a few things.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.560]   First, there's just the thermic effect of food,
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.920]   and for protein, there's a greater thermic effect.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.220]   You also have, and I think there's decent,
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.120]   at the time there was decent literature to support this,
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.280]   so I don't know if it's changed,
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.360]   that the protein intake along those lines
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   has an appetite-suppressing effect.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.820]   So the net daily calories consumed tends to be less
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.300]   when someone has a higher protein meal earlier in the day.
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.380]   And last but not least, I will say one of the risks,
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.480]   and there are many people who execute well on this,
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.940]   but you have to be very meticulous,
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.600]   which is true of the ketogenic diet as well.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.960]   You can get yourself into a lot of trouble
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.680]   if you do it 60% right or 70% right.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.720]   You really, yeah, you can get yourself in there.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.560]   - In there, massive psoriasis.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.600]   I mean, my scalp, you know, sloughing off.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.960]   Like when I'm in ketosis,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.460]   I'm like, what the hell is going on here?
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:40.100]   Going back on some complex carbohydrates and going away?
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:40.940]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:43.120]   - So I don't need a randomized control trial
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.960]   to know I simply don't want to run that experiment again.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.800]   - Don't want to lose your scalp.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:50.100]   Yeah, so in the case of, say, time-restricted feeding,
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   some people who do intermittent fasting
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.600]   lose a lot of muscle mass.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.240]   And there are multiple reasons for this.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.520]   I think people should make use
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.960]   of relatively widely available tools like DEXA and so on
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.300]   to ensure that your composition is actually moving
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:09.600]   the way you think it's moving.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.660]   Make sure you standardize your hydration for that
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.240]   as well as time of day.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.840]   Just pro tip, that's true for blood tests as well.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.720]   But it seems to get net-net better effects
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.640]   than trying to teach people how to fast effectively,
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.920]   which you can do, and we can talk about fasting.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.340]   That's something that was not included in the four-hour body
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:30.560]   that were I to rewrite it today,
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.800]   I would include a section.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.400]   And there was a bit in Tools of Titans
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.280]   to address that on more extended fasts.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.240]   Let's just call it three to seven-day fasts.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.680]   So that's an area that's of great interest to me,
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.400]   as is ketosis and metabolic psychiatry,
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.680]   a la Chris Palmer, who we both know.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.500]   - Incredible.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:54.380]   I mean, what the awakening that he's created
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.480]   through his book and going on your podcast,
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:00.760]   my podcast and others, and letting people be aware
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.700]   that changes in diet can impact mental health.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.140]   So I think in two, three years, it's going to be a duh.
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.420]   And we're not just talking about the difference
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:12.440]   between slamming back horrible foods,
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.260]   horrible for us foods versus eating really clean.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.340]   I mean, really specific diet protocols
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.920]   to treat mental health, that's incredible.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:20.920]   - Yeah, super exciting.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.160]   So that's one of the things
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.840]   that I'm paying a lot of attention to right now.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.400]   They're a handful in that realm within the,
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.620]   just say the interplay of mind and body,
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.820]   since the Cartesian duality and separation of those two
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:36.820]   makes no sense from a biological standpoint.
[01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:40.360]   So that's something that certainly captured my attention.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.120]   I paid a lot of attention to even as far back
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.980]   as early 2000s for mental health
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.680]   and just cognitive performance.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.880]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.580]   and thank our sponsor, Inside Tracker.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.840]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.500]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:58.980]   to help you better understand your body
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.820]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:03.600]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.760]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.780]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.380]   can only be assessed with a quality blood test.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.340]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.800]   however, is that they'll give you information
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.940]   about certain lipid markers or hormone markers,
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.020]   but no information about what to do with all of that data.
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.140]   Inside Tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.060]   of hormones, metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:28.460]   and then to assess what sorts of behavioral,
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.860]   nutritional, supplementation,
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.260]   or perhaps other interventions you might want to use
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.220]   in order to bring those numbers into the ranges
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.620]   that are optimal for your health.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.540]   For this week only, the week of June 19th, 2023,
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.300]   Inside Tracker is offering a buy one, get one free
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:43.300]   on their ultimate plan.
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.560]   This is their best discount of the year.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.440]   You can get this offer
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.560]   by going to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.160]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.480]   Thanks for revisiting some of the four-hour body
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.660]   and slow carb diet and elaborating on some of the process
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.500]   that went into that.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.880]   And I think creators of all kinds, thinkers of all kinds,
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.720]   and people who are interested in the contents
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.660]   of the four-hour body are going to be very grateful
[01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.520]   for that information.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.900]   I certainly am fascinated by your process.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.280]   One of the things that you mentioned
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.160]   along the lines of process was, you know,
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.600]   the power of places and where one happens to live.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:24.640]   I think there's an essay by Paul Graham
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.640]   that talks about this.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:28.160]   It's a little outdated, you know,
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.960]   and it talks about the messages that you,
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.200]   the tacit messages of being in certain cities.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.200]   I think it was, you know, like Boston,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:36.560]   you're not smart enough.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.360]   What was it?
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.800]   New York, you're not powerful enough.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.280]   And not you, I always say, I'm just thinking.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.200]   Or you should be more powerful is the message,
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.880]   like the tacit message.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.680]   Los Angeles, what you're doing,
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.000]   people aren't paying attention,
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.880]   paying enough attention to it, something like that.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.440]   Like the tacit messages, these are stereotypes about cities.
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.720]   Certainly cities change.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.660]   The role of places is an interesting one.
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.120]   Like, you know, you mentioned, you know,
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.980]   a small gathering, Kevin Kelly's house, quantified self.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:10.840]   And I think for people who don't know people like that,
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.540]   right, maybe we could get your thoughts on, you know,
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.500]   how would one think about where to live
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.660]   and maybe even curating their own gatherings,
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.260]   useful gatherings, because it's not that,
[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.060]   I have to imagine it's not that you guys sat back
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.380]   and you're like, I'm Tim Ferriss.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   And he's like, I'm Kevin Kelly, let's have a gathering
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:31.120]   so we can talk about it in a few years on a podcast.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.380]   This stuff happens, that word, you know,
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.080]   it's a dangerous word, organically.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.320]   When people who have common interests decide
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.360]   to get together and talk and listen and brainstorm.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.840]   And I'm yet to do that with good people
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.140]   and not have something really incredible come out of it.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.960]   Not necessarily that day, but looking five years,
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.360]   looking back five years later and just going,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.040]   God, that was really worthwhile.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:57.880]   - Totally.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.300]   - Yeah.
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.760]   - Few thoughts in no particular order.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.400]   I would say the first is it depends,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.920]   my recommendations depend a lot on where you are
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.200]   in the arc of your career in life.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.200]   If you are in full growth hyperdrive mode
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:19.700]   and you are trying to build both yourself
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:22.920]   and your capabilities in a very concentrated way
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.200]   where you're not necessarily focused on family,
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.200]   maybe have fewer obligations, then if you're serious,
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.360]   I think many people should consider moving
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.800]   to an area of high density.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.060]   For a period of time, it could be three months,
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.320]   it could be six months, could be longer,
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.700]   but putting yourself in a New York or an LA
[01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:50.700]   or a San Francisco or Chicago or as new places develop,
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.280]   I'll give you one you might not expect,
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.600]   say Ottawa, Canada, where Shopify is based
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.000]   and the presence and growth of Shopify
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.560]   has spawned an entire ecosystem of startups.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.600]   So there may be options outside of the usual cast
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.880]   of characters, Pittsburgh and Duolingo, similar effect.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.640]   So there are more options than people might recognize,
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   but taking a journey and placing yourself
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.440]   in a place where you can be in a very active
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:27.160]   pinball machine where you may interact serendipitously
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.660]   with many different people from many different worlds,
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:33.980]   I think is hard to overstate the value of.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:38.980]   And my drive and my filtering function, let's just say,
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.620]   because when I first got to the Bay Area,
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.900]   nobody cared about me, I was nobody.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.660]   I was driving my mom's used minivan hand-me-down
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:47.540]   that had the seats stolen out of the back,
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:48.380]   it looked terrible.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.560]   - Were you in the South Bay?
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.700]   - I was working in San Jose, yep.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.700]   - I mean, no disrespect to San Jose, I'm from the South Bay,
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:58.260]   but there's a bleakness to the South Bay.
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.200]   - There is a little bit of bleakness,
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.780]   and then I lived across the street in this tiny apartment,
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.380]   lived across the street from the Jack in the Box
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.420]   in Mountain View.
[01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:08.100]   So it's not like I was strolling onto the big stage
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.660]   and just blowing people away.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.360]   - Oh, I grew up right near Mountain View,
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.540]   I'm very familiar, I probably skated the curves
[01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.060]   at that Jack in the Box. - You probably did.
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.300]   - Did you train at the Gold's Gym in an off-ramp store?
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.620]   - I did, actually. - Amazing.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.180]   That was a great gym. - That was a great gym.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:22.020]   - That was a great gym.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:22.840]   I don't think it's still there.
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.500]   - I'd go there super late before my writing sessions.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.160]   And it had the benefit of being open really, really late.
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.100]   And wow, rang story, haven't thought about that
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.060]   in a long time.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:34.420]   So the point is, I also started
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.940]   where a lot of people are starting.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.660]   And what did I do?
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.480]   I put myself in a high-density environment.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.560]   Next, what did I do, knowing no one?
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.380]   I started to volunteer at events
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.460]   where they had interesting speakers
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.140]   and interesting people coming to hear those speakers.
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.800]   So I put myself in Silicon Valley,
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.800]   and then I began volunteering for groups like S-VACE.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.040]   I don't know if it exists anymore,
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.100]   the Silicon Valley Association of Startup Entrepreneurs,
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.680]   I think it was, Thai, the Indus Entrepreneur,
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.420]   which is a very sort of Indian
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   or Indian-American focused organization
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.980]   that does a lot in the realm of startups.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:17.060]   And I would carry water, I would take out garbage,
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.060]   I would check name badges, I would check people in.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:22.000]   Nothing was too low for me.
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.420]   And I'll give you guys a tip
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:28.860]   that will be obvious to some, but non-obvious to many.
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.220]   When you are volunteering, a lot of folks who volunteer
[01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.340]   do the absolute bare minimum
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.520]   because they are not getting paid.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.740]   This is not gonna get you noticed.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.040]   But it sets a very low bar,
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.300]   so that if you volunteer at these events,
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.620]   and someone's dropping the ball,
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.380]   or there's something happening that needs fixing,
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.360]   and you just proactively do it,
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.460]   the producers of these events will notice you.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.720]   And this is what happened over time, over a few months.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.740]   And then I got invited to join in on meetings
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.420]   that were planning future events,
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:00.980]   and I eventually got to the point
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.840]   where I was recruiting speakers
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.920]   and able to set the agenda for an entire main event.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:10.420]   And then that's how I got to know, say, Jack Canfield,
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.780]   who is the co-creator of Chicken Soup for the Soul,
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.780]   and many others, who introduced me to my book agent
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:20.120]   many, many, many, many years later, Jack Canfield.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.820]   But I was a nobody then.
[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:24.360]   You have to play the long game,
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   but you can be methodical on how you play that.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.980]   And that is one approach, just as an example,
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:34.480]   for how to build your network, which snowballs over time.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.500]   Don't hump every VIP's leg
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.460]   within 10 minutes of meeting them.
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.020]   Play it cool, you know?
[01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:42.580]   - And in gatherings where that person
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:44.620]   has a lot of demands on them
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.380]   is the last place you wanna do that, right?
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.220]   - The way you're gonna make yourself memorable--
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:49.300]   - No saliency to that.
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.740]   - Yeah, the way you're gonna make yourself memorable
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.520]   with people like that is to be very professional,
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.720]   always on time, predict what they're going to need
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.300]   or problems they'll run into beforehand
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.900]   and address them before they even think of them
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.440]   and be easy to deal with.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:08.200]   And people like that, high performers notice these things.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.780]   They will make note of it.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.320]   - Yeah, the being easy to work with is something that
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.420]   I used to tell my graduate students in postdocs.
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:19.700]   I mean, because the opposite of that, nobody wants.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.060]   - Yeah. - Right, nobody wants that.
[01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:21.980]   - Yeah, especially in the beginning.
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:24.020]   Like later, okay, great, you're Steve Jobs.
[01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:28.420]   You wanna be difficult here and there or a lot, no problem.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.460]   But in the beginning, that can be a real liability.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.940]   You can make up for that if you're the best in the world,
[01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.700]   but in the very beginning, you probably won't be.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.580]   So try to stack the deck in your favor.
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.900]   Volunteering is a shortcut.
[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.200]   And that would be one way of doing it.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.620]   Another now, especially given the virtual communities
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.540]   that exist, so you have subreddits,
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.380]   you have online communities, you have Twitter groups,
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.180]   you have Clubhouse, you've got a million different options,
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.620]   which can be overwhelming.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.840]   - Clubhouse still going?
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:57.780]   - Maybe not, I have no idea.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.300]   - Oh, no, I don't know, I'm not saying it's gone.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.820]   I just, I remember during the pandemic,
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.260]   there were some Clubhouse gatherings that hopped on there,
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:05.740]   but I've sort of forgotten to get on there.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:08.440]   - The platform affinity is really fickle,
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:12.080]   which is why I think to the extent possible,
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.140]   if you wanna build a world-class,
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.820]   and I use that term very deliberately,
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.900]   network in record time, just to give you a nice headline,
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.940]   I would say focus on the uncrowded channel,
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:26.780]   which is in person, it's out of fashion, it's out of vogue.
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:30.540]   Going to a conference and actually interacting with humans
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.880]   in the hallway, approaching panelists,
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.600]   this is another thing that I did.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.980]   I'll give another tip.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:37.900]   So very early on, I would go to conferences.
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.360]   Nobody cared who I was, nobody knew who I was, fine.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.020]   And I would study the panels.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.660]   Let's say I'm going to a big event like South by Southwest.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:50.780]   And I would, this is what I did in 2007,
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:54.700]   which was just prior to the first book coming out.
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:57.940]   And I would go to these various in-person events.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.420]   I was focused mostly on events
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:03.080]   that had the thematic focus of blogs.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:03.920]   We could come back to that.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.060]   But blogs were what podcasts were a few years ago, right?
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:09.460]   They drove incredible traffic,
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.660]   but they were undervalued by mainstream media,
[01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.160]   undervalued by mainstream publishers, et cetera,
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.220]   which meant there was an arbitrage opportunity in a way.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:23.160]   And I would pick, say, a handful of panels
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.680]   with topics I thought were super interesting.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:28.380]   And then the panel would end and what would happen?
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.040]   The panelists would get rushed by various folks
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.780]   because many of them were well known.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.400]   Who was not getting rushed?
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.820]   The moderator.
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:38.360]   I would go straight to the moderator.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.680]   And I would talk to the moderator.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.920]   I'd thank them for the panel.
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:41.900]   I would be very genuine.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.320]   None of it was made up.
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.440]   And talk to them for a bit.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.200]   They would generally ask why I was there,
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.040]   what I was interested in.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.200]   I would mention whatever that happened to be.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.540]   In this case, it was I'm finishing my first book
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:54.000]   or I had my first book coming out soon.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.720]   I'm here to hopefully meet people
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.480]   who are involved with A, B, or C.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.120]   And then if we hit it off, which was not true every time,
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:03.440]   but if it seemed to be going well,
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.620]   I would say I don't know anyone here.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:08.920]   I'm really sort of orphaned here,
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.480]   making my way through this entire event.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.280]   Is there anyone else here you think I would get along with
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:17.320]   who maybe I could buy a drink or a coffee?
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:19.540]   And the vast majority of the time, they'd be like,
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.560]   oh yeah, you should meet so-and-so.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.680]   And then I get the introduction
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.720]   and then I would meet that person.
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.960]   I would have a genuine interaction with that person.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.400]   And if it made sense, if things were going well,
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.500]   I'd do the same thing.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:34.160]   Is there anybody else here you think I should
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:36.520]   just say hi to and I'd get along with?
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.120]   Not who I can ask for something.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.200]   And that wasn't deception, I was being honest.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.560]   Like someone I could actually vibe with
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.900]   and if so, would you mind making the intro?
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.400]   Yeah, sure, no problem.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.560]   Many of those people are still my friends.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.280]   And by being surgical in that way,
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.640]   not trying to gather business cards,
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:03.160]   to use a really antiquated metaphor at this point.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:04.000]   - People still hand them out.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:04.820]   - Yeah, people still hand them out.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.660]   I guess it depends on where you are,
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.840]   especially like Boston.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.840]   But rather than trying to collect people as Pokemon cards,
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:19.540]   developing say five, three to five deeper relationships
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.720]   through longer conversations at an event,
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:27.420]   that is what directly led ultimately to the hockey stick
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.640]   for the four hour work week within tech,
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.600]   within specifically San Francisco.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.720]   So those would be a few approaches for building your network
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.280]   when you don't have the ability to just walk up
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:41.500]   to say a Kevin Kelly and have a conversation.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:43.240]   That came over time.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.800]   - Yeah, whether or not it's health practices
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.620]   or nutritional practices or at meetings,
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:55.140]   it seems you're oriented toward the uncrowded
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:59.020]   but very interesting people in spaces.
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:01.760]   But the keyword there I think is uncrowded
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.760]   and of course the other key word is interesting, right?
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.680]   I mean, it's not like you're standing in the parking lot
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.240]   talking to whoever happens to be there,
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.720]   although that can be interesting, right?
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.940]   There's a serendipity there
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:13.600]   and there's always things to learn from people.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.680]   But in terms of career advancement and building new ideas
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.160]   and forging for information,
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.820]   I'm just struck how you've done that over and over.
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.680]   And again, thank you for giving us some insight
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.480]   into the process, please.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.620]   - Here's another one.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:31.400]   So I think there's a tendency among people
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:35.960]   who want to develop their networks or their relationships
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:40.000]   to be star fuckers, not to get too technical, but--
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.040]   - That's a technical term.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.600]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.640]   They want to tell other people they are friends with someone
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.600]   more than they want to develop skills
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.400]   or learn from someone.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.600]   This puts you in a very disadvantaged position
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.140]   because then that means, all right,
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:57.320]   you want to become friends with Elon Musk, good luck.
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.640]   Or you want to become friends with this A-lister,
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.200]   celebrity who everyone else wants to meet, good luck.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.140]   It's going to be a crowded, bloody path to get there.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.420]   And by the way, they've also certainly developed
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.720]   really attuned defenses against people like you.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.440]   So it's going to be hard.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.000]   - Yeah, they have staff to prevent that from happening.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.520]   - They have a phalanx of protectors to prevent you
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.320]   from ever getting to that person.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.560]   On the other hand, if you're approaching it
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:29.160]   from the standpoint of developing skills, learning,
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.520]   and actually becoming potential friends with someone,
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.060]   I'll give you an example, you could go after,
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:39.940]   you want to become better at boxing.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.760]   Let's just make that up, all right.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.800]   Maybe not the greatest example, skiing would be another one,
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.360]   but let's stick with boxing
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.960]   just because of the way I'll explain it.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.540]   If you wanted to, say, get personalized lessons
[01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:54.480]   from Floyd Mayweather, ain't going to happen.
[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:58.280]   Okay, let's go then maybe a step down out of the pro ranks
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.080]   to gold medalist.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.520]   Okay, if it's a brand new gold medalist,
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.840]   let's just say like Oscar De La Hoya
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.920]   when he was really the golden boy
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.780]   and it just thrashed everyone, still going to be hard.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.120]   What about the silver medalist who just had a bad day
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:13.920]   when he had that last bout against Oscar De La Hoya,
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:14.920]   potentially, right?
[01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.440]   From a technical perspective,
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.640]   from a personal connection perspective,
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.240]   you may have more in common with that person
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.800]   or a bronze medalist, and they can get you 70, 80, 90%
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.420]   of the way there, and by the way,
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.120]   you probably don't have the physical attributes
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:30.240]   to make it through 100% anyway,
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.240]   if you're coming to it this late.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.400]   And you could get, in many cases,
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.720]   one-on-one lessons, whether in person or virtually,
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.800]   with someone who is of that caliber.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.640]   They're in the same front of the pack
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.880]   as the names I just mentioned, maybe not as famous.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:52.160]   100 bucks, 200 bucks per hour?
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.440]   For a lot of people, that is within reach.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.760]   - Yeah, and I'm not sure what the value of saying
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.140]   one knows somebody very famous is.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.400]   It's just never been something that I've oriented to.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.120]   - It's a common orientation, though,
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:09.240]   and I think that's true for a lot of things.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:12.200]   Many people use, say, psychedelics because they want
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:15.800]   to tell other people the story that they have
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.840]   of doing psychedelics, right?
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.920]   They're not doing it intrinsically for what they hope
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.100]   to get out of that experience.
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:24.560]   Maybe there's part of them, but it's more
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.680]   of the social signaling and validation they get
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.280]   when they project that out at a group dinner
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.320]   into a story that they can tell.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.920]   And that's true for many things.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.280]   So one of the questions I ask myself
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.200]   with all sorts of things, if I could never talk about this,
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.800]   would I do it?
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.360]   - What a great, great thing to think about.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.800]   - Right, like, if I could have,
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.440]   let's just say we didn't know each other,
[01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.880]   and I was like, okay, I'm earlier in my career.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.200]   Let's apply some constraints.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.760]   So I'm not where I am.
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.360]   I still want to do A, B, and C in the public eye.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.200]   Maybe I want to build a podcast, whoever.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.040]   If I could meet with you, but I could never tell a soul,
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:00.860]   would I do it?
[01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:01.700]   - I don't know, would you?
[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.880]   - I would. - Thank you.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.720]   - I would.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.800]   - I would too, right?
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.400]   - But for a lot of folks, if they--
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.320]   - Meaning I'd meet with you.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.680]   I'm not saying I'd meet with me, by the way.
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.280]   I'd meet with me.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.640]   Believe me, I meet with me all the time,
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.960]   and sometimes it's pretty unpleasant.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.160]   - Yeah, and that can be applied to all sorts of things,
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.580]   right, and it's a useful question,
[01:26:20.580 --> 01:26:24.620]   'cause I ask myself this, for examining your motivations.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.140]   And I'm not saying one motivation
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:27.200]   is always better than another,
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.260]   but you should at least be aware
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:31.660]   of your driving motivations,
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.140]   because you can end up playing games
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.700]   you're not even aware you're playing,
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.060]   and that's how you end up, I think,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.020]   getting into a lot of trouble in life, one of the ways.
[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:41.500]   So that would be a question I might apply.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.660]   I apply other questions, like there's a great question
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.580]   that Seth Godin applies, who really I admire tremendously,
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.860]   and has built an incredibly unorthodox,
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:55.740]   unique life for himself and his family.
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:59.100]   He's zigged when everyone would expect him to zag,
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.620]   and he always has a defensible logic behind it.
[01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.700]   And much like Derek Sivers, but most people
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.980]   have probably heard the hypothetical question,
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.940]   like what would you do if you knew you couldn't fail, right?
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:13.080]   Or what would you do if you couldn't fail?
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.520]   And Seth turns that around.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.580]   I think that's a good question.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:17.400]   He turns around and he said,
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.860]   what would you do if you knew you were gonna fail?
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:24.340]   In terms of identifying what you would do for the process.
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:27.920]   What would you do if you knew it was gonna fail?
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.560]   Okay, you're considering these five different projects.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:30.680]   Let's say they're all gonna fail,
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.820]   but you still have to choose one of the five.
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.140]   Which would you choose?
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.820]   - Yeah, that's a great question.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:39.220]   Much harder to answer.
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.060]   - Yeah.
[01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.700]   - And at the same time, I'm called back to
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:45.100]   when I was a graduate student,
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.380]   and still now with the podcast,
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:51.680]   I have this litmus test, which is,
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.420]   is the experiment that I'm working on
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.420]   the one that I want to be working on most?
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:57.700]   Is the podcast that I'm working on
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.080]   the one that I want to be working on most?
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.820]   I mean, there's truly no other podcasts
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:03.180]   I'd rather be having today than this one, right?
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.240]   And the moment I'm starting to think,
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.020]   oh, I wish I was doing that thing over there,
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.800]   I realize I'm off target.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.640]   I'm off target.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.960]   And I think that asking really good questions
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:15.800]   is something clearly that you're very good at.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.920]   And getting a little bit deeper
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.280]   into your process around that,
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.780]   do you write those things down?
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.280]   Like, is there a notebook someplace
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:26.740]   in the kingdom of Tim Ferriss in Austin or elsewhere
[01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:31.200]   that says those questions that,
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.880]   essentially those questions are written, are they--
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:34.960]   - Yeah, I collect, I literally have a document
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.600]   with questions that I've gathered from Seth,
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.880]   printed out and at the Airbnb where I'm staying here.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.720]   So I'm--
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:42.540]   - You brought it with you.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:43.760]   - I printed it out here.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.560]   And then I went through and I read it last night
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.560]   and I was highlighting questions from past interviews
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.960]   I've had with him on my podcast to revisit his questions.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.400]   So I was literally doing that last night over dinner.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.200]   And I collect questions.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:00.440]   I collect questions if I am reading a magazine
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.680]   and I come across a good question,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.280]   I take a photo or I capture it somehow in notes
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.200]   or in Evernote, which I know is kind of old fashioned
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.640]   these days, but I used it for everything.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.360]   So the critical mass is beyond enormous.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.920]   And I do collect and revisit these things.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.880]   I capture them in journals as well,
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:22.340]   but I absolutely capture good questions when I find them.
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:24.520]   - Questions are so powerful for the brain.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.120]   I don't want to go into this in too much detail
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.680]   'cause I have a lot more questions for you,
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:31.880]   but we just wrapped a series on mental health
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.000]   that will come out later this year with Paul Conte
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.340]   and he is brilliant as we both know
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.360]   and does truly important work.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:43.360]   And he pointed to the value of asking really good questions
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.760]   about oneself and because of the way that questions
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.440]   that are really directed at self-inquiry
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.100]   queue up the subconscious.
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.200]   So you ask the question and unlike a statement or a meme,
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.840]   the brain works with that in the days and hours
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.440]   after asking the question in ways
[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.680]   that simple declarative statements
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.240]   probably don't ping the system the same way,
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.600]   which is probably why we can see so many points of wisdom
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.960]   and truth everywhere.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.620]   And it doesn't necessarily transform us,
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.280]   but asking really good questions
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.240]   really does seem to transform us.
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   - Yeah, I think judging people by their questions
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:28.500]   is also a shortcut to assessing and learning a lot
[01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.280]   about how someone functions and what makes them tick.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.680]   I think it was Voltaire who said,
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.220]   judge a man by his questions, by his answers,
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:37.560]   something along those lines.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:40.120]   But when in doubt, attribute to Voltaire, it sounds good.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:40.960]   - Does sound good.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.800]   - And I think about this a lot.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.240]   I do think about the questions
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.720]   and I refine the questions that I ask myself,
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.080]   especially while journaling,
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.160]   because it's easier to cross-examine
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:56.160]   and stress test your own certainty and beliefs
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.600]   when they are captured on paper
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.520]   or digitally on a laptop, for instance.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.220]   So I do routinely revisit certain questions
[01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:10.760]   that I've found helpful over time.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.800]   I mean, one that people can play with
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:17.120]   is with whatever is really causing you consternation
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.320]   or stress at the moment, some kind of decision
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.000]   or relationship, business could be anything.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.760]   Just what might this look like if it were easy?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.840]   What might this look like?
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.580]   If it were easy, if it had to be easy,
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:32.380]   if that were possible, what might it look like?
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.580]   - And that could apply to anything.
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.700]   - Yeah, it could apply to anything.
[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:37.000]   Could apply to fitness.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.400]   It's like, look, if you do really intense
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.080]   kettlebell swings twice a week
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.920]   with proper weight and load and time under tension
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:48.100]   and you do pushups a few times a week
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:51.420]   and handle a couple of other elements,
[01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:53.200]   you can get in pretty good shape.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:57.080]   It's so simple, but it hits a lot.
[01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:58.660]   I mean, it hits your entire posterior chain.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.240]   Okay, fine, do some pushups and some core work.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.220]   But if you're not exercising at all
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:05.580]   because you've made the assumption
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:10.160]   that it's four hours, five hours a week,
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.160]   rather than completely remove that objective
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:19.220]   and call it just impractical,
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:21.060]   can you ratchet down the scale?
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.180]   How far can you ratchet down the scale
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:24.560]   until you have no excuses?
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:27.920]   That would just be one example.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.940]   Language learning, tech investing, it applies to everything.
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:34.040]   - Making life easier is something
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.400]   that definitely gets my vote.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.840]   - Yeah, making it easier and making it more elegant.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.120]   The more pieces in your life you have floating around,
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.720]   the more context, the more extraneous, loose connections,
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.040]   the harder your life is gonna be.
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.360]   The cognitive overload or overhead is really high.
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:54.280]   So I'm always looking for maybe like Japanese
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.120]   and a flower arranger.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.480]   It's like, okay, how many pieces can I remove
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.520]   while still maintaining the essence
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.760]   of what I'm trying to achieve?
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.360]   - You and Rick Rubin, man.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.280]   I'm telling you, two people I am fortunate enough
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.600]   to know personally and that I have tremendous respect for
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:12.320]   and the work is self-evident.
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.600]   It's really remarkable.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:17.520]   So rewind that and listen to that segment right there, folks.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.160]   I'm telling you, I've worked hard to apply it
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.360]   because it's not my default.
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.280]   And boy, does it make a significant improvement
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.000]   to simplify, simplify, simplify.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.760]   It takes some thought and question asking.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.080]   It's like, you just can't delete things at random
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.760]   till you get down to some fixed number.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:35.980]   But I'd like to ask you about another area
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.120]   where you really have seemed to see around corners.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.680]   And this is one that actually carried with it
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.360]   significant risk, not necessarily risk to health and to life,
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.480]   but risk in terms of outside perceptions.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.740]   And that's psychedelics.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:57.280]   As you know, I've substantially changed my view on this.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.520]   We don't need to go into my former stance on it.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.440]   I talked about that when you were gracious enough
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.920]   to host me on your podcast for a second time.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.480]   I'd done some psychedelics recreationally as a kid.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.280]   It was correlated with not so great times in my life,
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.920]   stayed away from them, then eventually revisited MDMA
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:13.960]   in particular from a therapeutic standpoint,
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:15.140]   found tremendous benefit.
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:17.840]   Again, therapeutically with a medical doctor.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.600]   Again, these drugs are illegal.
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.280]   Soon to change, perhaps, hopefully.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.600]   And we'll talk about that.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.600]   But it's becoming clear from the controlled studies
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.100]   by Robin Carter Harris.
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:35.360]   There are many others, okay, Nolan Williams, others,
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.020]   that these drugs have enormous potential
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.800]   to help relieve depression, trauma,
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:45.600]   help people explore their psyche, their mind
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.240]   for sake of feeling better, doing better in the world,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.440]   for leaning into life, not tune in, drop out,
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:54.680]   but to really lean into life with more purpose
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.880]   and more satisfaction.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:59.440]   In some cases, they've really have saved lives, I think.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.800]   What was your mindset around psychedelics
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.400]   when you first started exploring them?
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:11.400]   What led you to overcome the inevitable fear gap there?
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:16.320]   Because you do seem like somebody who takes value
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.200]   in your health, right?
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.640]   You're not reckless.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.680]   You may have been more adventurous in the past
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.340]   with things like, I hate the word,
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.980]   but biohacking and self-experimentation than you are now.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.200]   But you obviously have some self-preservation mechanism
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:29.680]   intact. - We learn, we learn.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.840]   - We learn.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:33.100]   What was your mindset around it at the time?
[01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:36.660]   And then I want to get to what you've learned from it
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:41.280]   and frankly, the tremendous efforts that you've put
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.680]   that are now translating to tremendous value
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:45.520]   for really millions of people.
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.520]   And ultimately, I think it's going to be billions of people.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:52.280]   By establishing funding for the pioneering research
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.480]   in this area, helping to promote the movement
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.020]   of these compounds from illegal to legal
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:00.920]   in the therapeutic setting, so on and so on.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:05.920]   So take us back to your first thoughtful exploration
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.140]   of psychedelics.
[01:36:07.140 --> 01:36:08.020]   What did that look like?
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.320]   You're like, oh, mushrooms, I'll eat them.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.160]   Was that it?
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   Or was it a dedicated research process?
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.840]   And who'd you talk to?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.320]   What was it all about?
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:25.120]   - So let's go way back to my undergrad experience.
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.040]   And there were many reasons that I ended up
[01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.160]   going to Princeton.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.520]   I think I was very lucky to get in.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.360]   My SAT scores because I could never finish the damn test.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.840]   I was so much of a perfectionist, I'd get stuck
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.440]   and ended up not doing terribly well.
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:40.560]   But through essays and other things,
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.640]   ultimately was able to go.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.920]   Part of the draw-- - Well, let me interrupt you
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.320]   and just say, I think at this point we can say
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.480]   they were lucky to have you.
[01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.720]   - Well, thank you for saying that.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.840]   - Yeah. - Thank you for saying that.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.440]   - Great institution and you've done great
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:55.860]   and you're a great poster on the wall for them.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.000]   - Yeah. - Oh, really?
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.440]   - I hope so. - Really, really.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:00.680]   Yeah, I just want to say it 'cause you're not going to
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.000]   and I think it's important that these are great institutions
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.360]   of great minds go through there and, you know,
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:09.960]   Einstein went through there and their success rests
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:12.800]   not just on the Einsteins, but also on the student body
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.240]   and what they go out into the world and do.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.040]   And not just in the realm of science.
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:18.320]   So really, they're lucky to have had you.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.860]   - Yeah, thank you, Andrew.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:22.240]   I studied Chinese in a room where Einstein used to teach.
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.400]   It's pretty cool to set foot and spend time weekly
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.560]   in a space that was shared by some of these people.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.740]   - Amazing. - It really gets
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.760]   the imagination firing.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.120]   If we go back to that chapter in my life,
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:39.700]   I was initially a psychology major
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.200]   with a focus on neuroscience.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.280]   So I wanted to be a neuroscientist.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.700]   And there are many reasons for that.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.760]   I have neurodegenerative disease on both sides of my family,
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.920]   so Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:56.280]   So that was certainly a personal driving interest
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.780]   in terms of looking at mechanisms,
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.140]   understanding what therapeutics existed or did not exist,
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:04.620]   how things were developing in the research.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:09.620]   And while I was there, which later I ended up
[01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:12.040]   switching gears and transferring to focus
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.320]   on language acquisition and East Asian studies,
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.020]   hence the Chinese that I mentioned earlier
[01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:16.960]   and Japanese and Korean.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:19.960]   But on the neuroscience side,
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.800]   there were a lot of cool breakthroughs also
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.800]   that came out of Princeton around that time,
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.800]   looking at the amazing discovery of, say,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.420]   neuronal, I don't want to say regenesis,
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:35.520]   but neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.940]   - Yeah, Liz Gould's work. - Exactly, exactly.
[01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.940]   So there was quite a bit happening at that time.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.960]   I was a subject, I loved volunteering for studies
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.280]   just to try to get an inside look at how things were done
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:50.240]   in some of Daniel Kahneman's experiments.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.660]   So it was a cool time to be there.
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:56.880]   And within the first two years, I want to say,
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.840]   I had my first experience recreationally with mushrooms.
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.840]   And looking back now, I'm horrified by the lack of control,
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.160]   and meaning not control, but lack of supervision, right?
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.520]   I mean, the setting, the set and setting ended up being fine.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.560]   Nothing terrible happened,
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.040]   but there were a lot of ways it could have gone sideways.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.920]   But that first experience,
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.640]   and I must have consumed in retrospect,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.240]   just a dizzying amount of mushrooms.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.000]   - It used to be in excess of five grams.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.320]   - Oh, a little bit more, yeah.
[01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.800]   Just knowing what I know now, it would have been-
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.520]   - Kids don't do this at all.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.360]   - Don't do that.
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.960]   - I'm not going to say don't do it at home.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:33.780]   Don't do it at all.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:34.620]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:39.040]   - Please, I actually don't think the young developing brain
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.880]   should be exposed to psychedelics.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.720]   - We can talk about that.
[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:42.560]   - We can talk about that.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.160]   I'm going to take my stance.
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:45.800]   I'm going to take my stance for now.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.800]   - Yeah, I mean, in the world in which we live, in the US,
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:53.160]   I would totally agree with you.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.200]   There are some interesting cultural exceptions
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.880]   in other places where things are more set up
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.100]   to provide for that type of use,
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.220]   but I certainly would not recommend it.
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:07.640]   But coming back to my recreational experience,
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.800]   my subjective experience was so bizarre
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:15.640]   and my experience of time so nonlinear,
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.280]   my experience of self so different
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:22.040]   from anything I had experienced up to that point.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:26.560]   And therefore, my construction of reality
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:31.340]   being so completely unlike anything I had experienced
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:34.560]   was enough to make me want to learn about these compounds.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.560]   And very early on, I still have a scan of it somewhere.
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.320]   I think it was in 1998 or '99, I actually wrote a paper.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.000]   One of my junior papers was focused
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.640]   on examining potential similarities
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:53.640]   between REM sleep and LSD, LSD 25.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:59.960]   And looking at some of the patterns of neural activity,
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:02.160]   of course, we can do a lot more now
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.360]   with the tools that we have available.
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.560]   But from a scientific perspective,
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.160]   I was very curious about how much we knew
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.520]   and how much we didn't know.
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:15.400]   And I would say that latter category
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.280]   gets me more excited in a way.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:22.280]   And I'm like, okay, how much room is there for growth here?
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.880]   Because if we're just putting on the finishing touches
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.280]   with marginal incremental improvements
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.340]   on something that we feel like we've largely figured out,
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:31.680]   that's less interesting to me
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.320]   than something that baffles most people
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.440]   examining them on some level.
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:39.320]   And there was a professor named Barry Jacobs
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.800]   who was doing some very interesting work.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.320]   He did a lot of work looking at the serotonergic systems
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.960]   and did a lot of work with cats.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.120]   Ultimately, I could not do personally
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.360]   the animal work required of the sort of indentured servitude
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.200]   that I would [laughs]
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.360]   - I think you wrote someplace once,
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:02.080]   you said when confronted with the prospect
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.440]   of installing a computer printer into the head of a cat.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.400]   - A printer jack on the back of a cat head.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.520]   - On the back of a cat head.
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.960]   - They literally had those little VGA ports
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.560]   on the back of these cats' heads because cats sleep a lot.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.280]   And so they're an interesting study.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:20.200]   - Cats, very few laboratories work on cats any longer.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.840]   It's mostly a mouse, still some non-human primate work.
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.260]   My laboratory is essentially shut down
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:27.600]   or as in the process of shutting down even our mouse work.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.760]   I much prefer to work on humans.
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:32.440]   They can give consent and they house themselves.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.000]   The animal research thing is tough for any sentient being.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.520]   - Yeah, it's tough.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:39.280]   For what it's worth, the cats seem pretty happy.
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:40.120]   They were just sleeping.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.680]   I mean, the ports were for tracking.
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.360]   So the cats were pretty, I mean, they were just normal cats.
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:47.300]   The cats were fine, but I would have been,
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:50.520]   we would have been injecting retroviruses into rats
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:53.480]   and then perfusing them, which means bleeding them to death
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:56.280]   to avoid bruising of the tissue
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:59.040]   because then if you were gonna take thin slices and scans,
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:00.720]   you didn't wanna have bruising.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.080]   And I just couldn't, I just couldn't do it.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.120]   I think it's important.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.240]   I do think, I do think there's a place for it,
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.080]   but I couldn't do it.
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.280]   So that's why I transferred out.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.800]   But the point I was trying to make
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.240]   is that I had the experience
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.640]   and then I had that drive the scientific interest.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.680]   And then I had probably one experience per year
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.620]   for a few years after that.
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:29.160]   And what I noticed for myself personally,
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.360]   because I suffered from major depressive disorder
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.220]   and extended depressive episodes,
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:37.080]   let's just say on average, three to four a year.
[01:43:37.080 --> 01:43:38.540]   And by extended--
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.800]   - Even before you had started?
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.860]   - Oh, even before, yeah.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.700]   - From a young age.
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:42.540]   - Yeah, from a very young age.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.800]   And I would say, so let's just call it three to four
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.080]   on average a year.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.080]   Those could last each a few weeks or a few months.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.960]   I mean, this is a very high percentage of my total year.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.600]   And when I had these higher dose experiences with mushrooms,
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:00.300]   so we're talking about psilocybin mushrooms,
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:02.840]   and then if we're looking at the molecule
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.760]   that's being examined scientifically, psilocybin,
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:10.920]   I noticed this afterglow effect that was really durable.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.860]   And that was an antidepressant effect
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:18.080]   or a mood elevating effect that lasted far longer
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.980]   than the half-life could explain, right?
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:24.540]   Because four to six hours, you're kind of on the other side.
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:28.420]   And I would experience this afterglow effect
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.180]   for three to six months.
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:33.020]   And that raised all sorts of interesting questions.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.660]   What the hell is going on here?
[01:44:34.660 --> 01:44:36.040]   Is it the content?
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.340]   Is it some structural change?
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.260]   There were a lot of unanswered questions for me.
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.380]   And then I had a very, very scary experience
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:46.520]   that led me to completely stop use of psychedelics
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.260]   where, again, uncontrolled environment ended up
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:55.000]   in rural New York coming out of my trip
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.480]   standing in the middle of the road in the middle of the night
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:57.840]   with headlights coming at me.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.820]   - Goodness gracious.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:00.000]   - So you don't want to do that.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.760]   And I was like, okay, too dangerous.
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.800]   - Were you taking them alone?
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.640]   Is that how that is?
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:05.680]   - I was taking them with two friends and my two friends
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.080]   without telling me just went for a walk and left me alone.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:09.920]   So don't do that.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.820]   - It points to the, I mean, these are powerful compounds.
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.680]   - Yeah, you're playing with nuclear power.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:18.840]   Like these are the, this is the nuclear power
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:23.840]   of psychological or psycho-emotional surgery
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.960]   is the way I encourage people to think about them.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.360]   And I stopped using any psychedelics completely.
[01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.740]   I was still very interested in them,
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:38.960]   but I basically hit pause.
[01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.720]   And I didn't revisit that until let's call it 2012, 2013
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.840]   where I was still struggling
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:45.980]   with major depressive disorder.
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:49.080]   And I saw my girlfriend at the time completely transformed
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.800]   by supervised facilitated use of, in this case, ayahuasca,
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   which was not quite as common as it is in conversation
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.520]   at the time.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.320]   And she did that in South America,
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:08.320]   but she not only explained her experience,
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.200]   but I was able to see the transformation in her
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.000]   that seemed to have some durability over time.
[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.400]   And that is when I started stepping back
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.160]   into researching psychedelics,
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.200]   looking at what had been published in the last,
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:28.860]   let's just call it 10 years as of that point in time.
[01:46:28.860 --> 01:46:33.860]   And thinking about how I would approach it systematically
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:38.200]   with safeguards, with proper supervision,
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.480]   and basically approaching it the way
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:41.040]   I would have approached any of the topics
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:42.600]   in the four-hour body.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.120]   And that is what led me back into,
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.720]   along with a number of other interventions, I should say.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.140]   So I wasn't betting the farm on psychedelics.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:53.720]   I also started TM at that point.
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:54.540]   I was-
[01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:56.240]   - You just have some people might-
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.200]   - Transcendental meditation.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:02.000]   - These are like four to 10-day meditation retreats.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.120]   - This was actually much shorter.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.920]   It was a two or three-day training.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.020]   And you're visiting the instructor,
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:09.820]   I want to say it's once or twice a day,
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:12.460]   probably once a day, and getting up to speed.
[01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.360]   And I did this because I was going
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.420]   through a period of acute stress.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:20.860]   This was finishing the four-hour chef.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:24.040]   This was actually probably in the years preceding that.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.820]   And I had one friend who I'd seen really change
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:31.820]   from let's just call hyperkinetic high anxiety
[01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:34.260]   to low anxiety.
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:36.840]   And he said, "You have the time, you have the money,
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.300]   "pay for the course, just take it."
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.520]   Yes, there are all these criticisms of TM.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.980]   Yes, there are all these weird historical anecdotes,
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.140]   people trying to levitate and all this weirdness.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:47.160]   Just ignore that.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.840]   - Trying to levitate, nothing against that.
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.320]   If you actually levitate, then we got to have a discussion.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.580]   But trying to levitate seems like-
[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.420]   - Why not?
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.420]   - Every kid tries all sorts of things.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:56.260]   - Give it a go.
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:58.380]   He's like, "Just put that aside."
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.060]   Because I kept coming up with pushback.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.440]   And he was like, "Look, all I'm saying is,
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.760]   "it's like a warm bath for your mind
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.800]   "that you take twice a day and it'll chill you the fuck out.
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:07.700]   "So try it."
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:08.540]   And I was like, "Okay, fine."
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:09.500]   - That's a good endorsement.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:10.700]   - I was like, at this point,
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:14.620]   I had been burning the candle at both ends so intensely.
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:15.580]   I was like, "Okay."
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:17.780]   So there was TM and then I began examining
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:18.900]   how I might approach.
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.740]   Notice I didn't just jump into using them.
[01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.700]   I was like, "How could I approach taking psychedelics
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:28.700]   "in a logical sequence with proper protections,
[01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:31.340]   "with safety assurances?"
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.460]   And that took me probably a month or two.
[01:48:35.460 --> 01:48:36.900]   And I was right in the middle of things.
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:39.460]   In Northern California, you have access to a lot.
[01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:41.820]   And only then did I start looking at
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.940]   having my own experiences.
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.300]   And lo and behold, I mean, I'll cut to the chase,
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.500]   but the personal outcome,
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:55.860]   and there are many different benefits and risks,
[01:48:55.860 --> 01:48:57.380]   I should make very clear.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.380]   These things can be extremely dangerous in certain ways.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:03.220]   Generally not physiologically, but they can be dangerous.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.260]   I would say instead of three to four times per year,
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:10.700]   on average, I probably have one depressive episode
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.260]   every two years.
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:14.500]   - That's a significant improvement.
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.240]   - Right, I mean, from a quality of life perspective,
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.940]   those are two different people.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:23.140]   And that then led me to,
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.180]   and as I did with all my workouts,
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:29.300]   I took copious notes over the span,
[01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:32.660]   I mean, now we're looking at 10 plus years.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:35.220]   So if I were to ever write another book,
[01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:38.340]   it would probably be related to all of the really
[01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:44.380]   fine details of the experiments and my learnings,
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:47.260]   including some of the more bizarre things
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.300]   over the last 10 years,
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.900]   but it would be just a beast to create.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.700]   - With psychedelics, experiences with psychedelics.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.380]   - Psychedelics and sort of psychedelic adjacent
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:03.060]   non-ordinary experiences of consciousness,
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:08.060]   which I think often are touching at edges of the same thing,
[01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:10.980]   which is gonna be controversial for some folks.
[01:50:10.980 --> 01:50:12.980]   But to come back to the storyline,
[01:50:12.980 --> 01:50:14.500]   just to put a bow on that,
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:19.740]   when I saw the personal outcomes for me,
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:23.460]   the anecdotal data from friends who are facilitators
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.060]   who have worked with thousands of people, right,
[01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.340]   which is a pretty good sample size.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.660]   Still anecdote, but these are people who are very smart,
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.340]   who keep records.
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:37.500]   And I believe that these people have spotted patterns
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.980]   that are only going to be possible to test and verify
[01:50:40.980 --> 01:50:42.460]   over the next five to 10 years.
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:47.380]   So I, at least as a means of generating hypotheses,
[01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.460]   I take these people very seriously.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:54.100]   And then I started to connect with scientists
[01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.020]   whose work I had read,
[01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.980]   like Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins,
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:51:00.060]   began looking at the most compelling data
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:05.060]   related to say MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and complex PTSD.
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:10.380]   I made the commitment to myself
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:13.060]   that as soon as I had enough money to move the dial,
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.420]   'cause I really felt like these tools
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.580]   were so outside of the normal paradigm
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.900]   of psychiatry and pharmacology.
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.500]   And that made me very excited because it was uncrowded.
[01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:27.100]   There's very little funding coming into the space.
[01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.220]   It was high leverage.
[01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:29.780]   And I looked at it just as I've looked
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:31.580]   at my many startup investments.
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:35.940]   Limited downside risk, really high upside potential.
[01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.940]   And I should say before that,
[01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:42.340]   I'd already been funding in a very small way science.
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:45.340]   So the first check I ever wrote was personally
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.980]   to Adam Ghazali's lab at UCSF.
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:48.820]   - Yeah, great lab.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:52.940]   - Which at the time was looking at software.
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:54.260]   He's not gonna like this description,
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:55.580]   but I'm gonna simplify it.
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:58.060]   Software that might attenuate
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:01.900]   or reverse age-related cognitive impairment,
[01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:06.900]   specifically related to various aspects of attention.
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:10.740]   And that was my first foray
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.500]   into funding early-stage science,
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:17.020]   which was very analogous to funding early-stage startups.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.980]   And then later on, to touch on the reputational thing,
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.260]   I know this is a TED Talk, so thank you for listening.
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:23.100]   - No, this is great.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.420]   Please, you're always so gracious on your podcast.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.740]   This is what people want.
[01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:29.660]   This is certainly what I want to hear.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:32.500]   - So on the reputational side, you're right that
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:37.500]   at the time, especially, let's just call it 2013 to 2015,
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:41.180]   this was not a comfortable national conversation
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:42.020]   of any type.
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:43.860]   - Yeah, I wouldn't have had this conversation back then.
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:44.780]   - No way.
[01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:46.580]   - I don't know that I would have lost my job.
[01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.440]   It just would have raised a lot of eyebrows.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.180]   Now that such studies are happening at Stanford.
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:53.700]   - Yeah, the perception was
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:57.060]   that these are a professional third rail,
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:52:58.540]   at the very least, right?
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:01.660]   Also illegal, therefore, if I talk about them,
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.460]   am I giving someone probable cause?
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.060]   Am I gonna get myself in some type
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:07.400]   of really tricky legal situation, et cetera?
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.040]   There are a lot of considerations.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.580]   But I tested that, just like I was saying,
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:14.620]   I like to capture my assumptions on paper
[01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:15.460]   so I can stress this.
[01:53:15.460 --> 01:53:19.060]   And I was like, okay, I think that might be true.
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:22.300]   Most people I know think that is true, but is it true?
[01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:25.700]   How could we test to see if that is true or not?
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:29.320]   And I decided to crowdfund
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:33.540]   for a Hopkins pilot study looking at psilocybin
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.540]   for treatment-resistant depression.
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:38.100]   And I thought to myself, okay,
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:42.720]   we have a couple of things falling in our favor here.
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:45.740]   Number one, depression does not discriminate.
[01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:48.380]   So across socioeconomic classes, across gender,
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.900]   across race, this is a problem.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:54.740]   Almost everyone knows someone who takes antidepressants
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:56.020]   who is still depressed.
[01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:58.860]   Okay, treatment-resistant depression,
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:00.900]   therefore, is the indication.
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:04.140]   Psilocybin is the intervention.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:07.860]   Let me crowdfund, and I did that throughout the time,
[01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:10.820]   CrowdRise, which was co-founded by Edward Norton,
[01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.340]   who had become a friend and was--
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:13.460]   - The actor, Edward Norton. - The actor,
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.220]   who's very smart, very, very, very smart.
[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:18.620]   Also one of the best investors I've ever met,
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:20.020]   which a lot of people don't know.
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.400]   Very bright guy.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:26.400]   And so, crowdfunded, and I also like to put my money
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.900]   where my mouth is.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:29.500]   I said, okay, guys, I'm gonna seed this.
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.840]   I'm putting in X.
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:32.740]   The goal is to raise, I think it was 80,000,
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:35.700]   something like that, for the following study.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.700]   And then I was like, let's see.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.780]   Let's see what happens.
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:43.780]   And there was basically zero negative blowback.
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:48.580]   And not only was there no discernible negative blowback,
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.620]   a number of people, and this was deliberate,
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:52.680]   I wanted to see this, a number of people came out
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.940]   of the woodwork to support in a bigger way.
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:57.380]   And I was like, oh, okay, I see you.
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:58.460]   A handful of folks I knew.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.580]   And I was like, oh, interesting.
[01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.340]   Okay, there are at least a half a dozen folks
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:05.260]   who are studying the same thing,
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:07.420]   or paying attention to the same thing.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:08.600]   And then I just got bolder.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:12.380]   I was like, okay, if I tested that, let me push.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:15.040]   And then let's see what happens, and I'll wait.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:19.580]   And lo and behold, I realized that the perception
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.700]   did not match the reality.
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:23.220]   The reality was, if you're talking about indications
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:25.180]   that cause an incredible amount of suffering
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:27.420]   for a very large number of people,
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:32.940]   even those who are anti-drug, per se,
[01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:35.440]   just say no to drugs, want solutions.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:37.900]   And the current treatments for many of these things
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.700]   do not work very well.
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:43.060]   And in the best of cases are often masking symptoms
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:46.620]   and not addressing root causes, I would say.
[01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:49.260]   So at that point, I just went whole hog,
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.780]   and I said, okay, look, I like to think
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.500]   that I am exactly what you see is what you get, right?
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.180]   The person you talk to off camera,
[01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.520]   person you talk to on camera, same.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:03.440]   And if I start feeling like I have too much to protect,
[01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:06.500]   I want to do something to counteract that.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:10.220]   In other words, if I feel like I need to censor
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:13.860]   my true feelings and beliefs, maybe not share my hardships,
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.540]   perhaps not promote certain things
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:18.260]   because I have a reputation to lose,
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.300]   that's a fragile position.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:22.820]   I want to be as anti-fragile as possible.
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:25.580]   And so by talking about this, I viewed it as a way
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:29.060]   of inoculating myself against fear of reputation loss.
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:31.420]   Like, okay, let me push this, I'll ride this horse.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:34.740]   Other people might not, but I want to remove the stigma
[01:56:34.740 --> 01:56:38.340]   for funding purposes, hopefully open up federal funding,
[01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:41.780]   that's starting to happen now from different agencies,
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:47.680]   and then to focus on access and reduction of cost
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:50.060]   and insurance reimbursement and so on.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:53.260]   So I set a game plan, let's call it maybe five years ago,
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:56.500]   and I've just been slowly, methodically
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.360]   executing on that since.
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.160]   And the reason I chose this to focus on,
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.300]   and I've funded other things,
[01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.940]   but I've really focused on this, mental health therapeutics,
[01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:07.740]   which is not limited to psychedel.
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:09.780]   And we can talk about some other things
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:10.660]   that I find interesting.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:13.700]   But psychedelics are, like I said,
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:15.500]   what makes it attractive.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.540]   Very uncrowded, you can do a lot with a small amount of money
[01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:22.100]   unlike, say, in cancer research, can be very hard.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:23.740]   Like, okay, you're a deca-billionaire, great,
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:25.340]   maybe you can do something interesting.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:26.520]   And I'm sure other people could,
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:29.620]   but if you have $20,000, $50,000,
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:31.000]   it's gonna be hard to make a dent there.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.820]   In psychedelics, you can actually still make a difference.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:35.680]   And very high leverage in part
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:38.680]   because these compounds seem to challenge
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:40.840]   much of what we assume to be true
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:43.360]   about treating mental health.
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:47.400]   And so that makes for an attractive bet.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.980]   So that's where I've been going.
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:52.520]   - Yeah, I'm so glad you shared that with us
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.780]   and that you did that exploration
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:58.960]   and that you've been spearheading the funding efforts.
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:03.540]   This podcast has a premium channel
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.360]   that's for raising funds for scientific studies.
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.740]   We are in the process now
[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:10.380]   making our first four contributions.
[01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:13.580]   One of those includes work in Nolan Williams Laboratory
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.740]   at Stanford combining transcranial magnetic stimulation
[01:58:16.740 --> 01:58:21.140]   with studies of Ibogaine and 5-MeO DMT,
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:22.140]   maybe a few other things.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.440]   But basically, he's free to do what he wants with the funds.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.940]   We trust him to do great work.
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:29.820]   But that, again, was inspired by you, right?
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:33.120]   A podcast with a scientific slant, certainly.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.720]   This podcast obviously has a scientific slant,
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:39.760]   but the idea of doing philanthropy for the sorts of work
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.920]   that really deserves funding and exploration.
[01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.540]   And by the way,
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:47.680]   in thinking about other hybrid things
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.520]   that would be fun to do,
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:52.600]   I mean, I would love to contribute and join those efforts
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:55.640]   'cause the work to continue to raise funding
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:56.820]   for psychedelic studies
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:58:59.440]   and all these great laboratories continues, right?
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.280]   - It continues.
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.740]   - And you've rallied a collection
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:05.300]   of some pretty powerful people to contribute to this.
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:08.420]   And I know you've joined arms with Michael Pollan
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.260]   in many ways.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:10.620]   Do you want to talk about the fellowships
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:11.540]   that you guys put together?
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:12.380]   I find that really cool.
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:15.000]   You've got fellowships in the works
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.660]   or maybe already happening at UC Berkeley.
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:18.500]   Is that right?
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:19.320]   - At UC Berkeley, yeah.
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.720]   So what I try to do,
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.740]   and for people who want to check it out,
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:24.940]   the name of the foundation is SAISEI Foundation.
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.280]   And let me explain that for a second.
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:28.360]   So it's S-A-I-S-E-I.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:31.120]   So saiseifoundation.org.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:31.960]   I speak Japanese.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.240]   I went there as an exchange student
[01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:35.180]   and speak, read and write it.
[01:59:35.180 --> 01:59:37.160]   Still to this day pretty well.
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.640]   SAISEI can mean a lot of things.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.400]   It means rebirth in Japanese.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:44.040]   And I've seen what can only be described
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:45.980]   or can certainly be described as rebirth
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:47.920]   in so many clinical outcomes
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:50.880]   that I thought it was appropriate to use.
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.880]   And what I've tried to do with the foundation is,
[01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.160]   I think, do what I'm pretty good at,
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:01.000]   which is trying to peek around corners
[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:04.000]   and find something to prototype, right?
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000]   So just like the CGM and like, all right,
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.920]   how can I, just getting a hold of a Dexcom back then
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.760]   when it was just for type 1 diabetics was hard.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.240]   - Isn't this the thing that you have to actually
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:14.680]   go under the skin?
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.100]   - It's like taking a barbecue prong
[02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:18.980]   and putting it under your abdominal skin.
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.120]   It was not comfortable.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:23.220]   - Can you describe your cortisol level
[02:00:23.220 --> 02:00:25.920]   and subjective terms when you're at home,
[02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.160]   you got this thing and you're about to implant it
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:29.200]   and you don't have any precedent.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:31.440]   It's not like this is, you know, like levels
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:34.060]   or one of these other CGMs that are out there.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.260]   You know, you stamp the thing in,
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.840]   you can look on Instagram and see someone else do it.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.660]   There's nothing like that.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:40.040]   So you're at home wondering if you're going
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:41.080]   to skewer your liver.
[02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:43.160]   - Yeah, I'm at home doing it myself
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.480]   and I'm sweating like a stuck pig.
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:46.640]   I'm sitting there, I'm like, my God,
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:47.460]   I don't even know if I can hold off.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.360]   - Is your girlfriend there like to support you
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:51.200]   in case you die?
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:52.440]   - I think at the time she wasn't
[02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:54.520]   because she was squeamish and didn't want to see it.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.320]   And so I'm sitting there at my kitchen table.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:01:00.040]   I remember this, God, I'm sweating just thinking about it.
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:03.520]   And no videos to watch.
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:07.640]   And wasn't really supposed to have it in the first place.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:12.320]   And the device for readout, by the way, no iPhone, right?
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:16.360]   So it was like this janky pager looking thing
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.880]   that had a readout that made you think
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:19.200]   you were playing Pong or something.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.040]   I mean, it was very--
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.960]   - The green tint screen.
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.800]   - Yeah, green tint screen.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:24.000]   - With the dot font.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:25.880]   - It was so primitive.
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:30.880]   And put this thing under my skin, would tape,
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.600]   I would cut a Ziploc bag and put it on top
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:36.920]   and masking tape it to my skin to take showers
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:39.380]   because otherwise it wouldn't work.
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:41.560]   And it was great.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.040]   And I'll just say that I don't use a seat.
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:44.880]   - It was great.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.020]   You realize you said it was great.
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:46.860]   - I did.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:47.680]   I did say it was great because--
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:49.240]   - I'm sweating and I was afraid.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.400]   - But it gave me a lot of insight.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.780]   And then once I had the insight over a course
[02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.120]   of a handful of weeks, then I felt like
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:01:57.520]   I didn't really need it anymore.
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.440]   And that was also just a heavy tax to pay
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.360]   to have to wear that thing around.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.440]   Look like you have a, what is it called,
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.960]   a colostomy bag or something.
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.100]   It was big, it was bulky.
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:13.100]   So just like I did that, I wanted to do a proof of concept.
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:18.120]   The goal was can I use this for healthy normal applications?
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:22.760]   Will the insights be actionable?
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:24.040]   And they were, lo and behold.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:26.580]   Similarly with the foundation,
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:28.360]   since I'm dealing with smaller amounts of money,
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.760]   and I'm not in the billionaire club
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:33.280]   by any stretch of the imagination,
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.600]   and science can be expensive, I'm looking for small bets.
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:40.040]   Where can I pilot something that if successful
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.240]   will be emulated or can be scaled?
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.760]   And so in the crowdfunding for the Hopkins
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:49.240]   treatment resistant depression pilot study,
[02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:50.420]   we ended up exceeding the goal.
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:53.040]   They were able to recruit more subjects.
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:56.280]   In the case of UC Berkeley, Michael Pollan
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:59.280]   and I partnered on this and my foundation funded it.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:02.160]   The Ferris UC Berkeley Journalism Fellowship,
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:04.120]   Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship,
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:08.720]   is providing funding to up and coming journalists
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:11.720]   who want to focus on psychedelics as their beat,
[02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.360]   which to this date has not been financially feasible.
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:19.940]   You just don't have the space to do
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:24.280]   really long form investigative work.
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:29.780]   The hope being that these journalists can apply
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:33.400]   their skills and their dedication to examining
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:36.720]   different facets of the psychedelic ecosystem,
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:41.360]   therapeutic potential, regulatory issues, et cetera,
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.640]   in a way that can shape and inform national
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:49.720]   and international discourse in a very critical way.
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:51.960]   Because these things are not a panacea,
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.400]   there's a lot of claims that are made about these
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.800]   that are totally unbacked by any type of science,
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.920]   and there are a lot of charlatans.
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:03.700]   And so I wanted to also invite really competent,
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.920]   really good journalists to the table
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:08.640]   who might want to watch for bad actors.
[02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:10.240]   I think that's really important.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:13.580]   And so this fellowship has been,
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:18.360]   has been awarding fellows with these grants.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.080]   And I think it's a relatively small amount of money.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.520]   It's like $10,000 per or something like that.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.520]   But the outcomes have been amazing.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.480]   We had a huge, I want to say a 7,000 word piece
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:30.760]   that was one of the main features in Rolling Stone magazine,
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:34.280]   huge piece in National Geographic focused on iboga
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:37.800]   and fair trade and some of the implications
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:42.800]   for local harvesting and or overharvesting,
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:46.500]   all the dynamics present in that,
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:49.140]   which I think has some incredible promise
[02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:53.380]   for particular forms of opioid use,
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:54.820]   opioid use disorder in particular,
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:57.820]   but that has been a huge success.
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:05:00.320]   So the hope is that other journalism schools
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:01.420]   will say that's a great idea.
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:05.020]   And I will have de-risked it for some other philanthropists
[02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:09.420]   or foundation or government, say director and agencies say,
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.340]   okay, we'll green light that, right?
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:13.780]   Because I've done it and it's been received very well.
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:18.180]   And it's had a real impact on how things are moving along.
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:20.580]   Another one would be say at Harvard Poplar,
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:21.780]   this is at Harvard Law School.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:25.160]   It was the first, is the first dedicated team
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.420]   focused on law, policy and regulation related to psychedelics
[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:30.520]   from a legal perspective.
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:32.540]   - Super important. - Super important.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:34.080]   - Super, super important.
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.080]   Also another pilot, let's just call it a proof of concept
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:43.980]   that Sci-Safe Foundation funded was helping to develop
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:48.980]   curricula for, I think it was Yale, Johns Hopkins and NYU,
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:52.580]   effectively an accreditation or module
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:56.460]   that they could put into their existing psychiatry MD
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:01.980]   programs such that people could develop
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:05.300]   the skills necessary and the understanding necessary
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:07.740]   to administer psychedelic assisted therapies
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:10.900]   if and when they become legal, prescribable.
[02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:15.140]   - If I understand correctly, it sounds like within the next
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:19.700]   12 to 24 months, MDMA assisted psychotherapy
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:24.420]   for the treatment of trauma is likely to become legal
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:27.420]   in the hands of psychiatrists at least
[02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:29.740]   and maybe certain clinical psychologists as well
[02:06:29.740 --> 02:06:31.820]   in the U.S., is that right?
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:33.820]   Through the efforts of the MAPS group.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:35.820]   - Yeah, through the efforts of maps.org
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.820]   and Rick Doblin and many others,
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.340]   that is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:43.420]   So I think anyone who's interested in psychedelics
[02:06:43.420 --> 02:06:47.760]   should have a vested interest in supporting those efforts.
[02:06:47.760 --> 02:06:52.300]   Not because we know everything works, I wanna be clear.
[02:06:52.300 --> 02:06:55.040]   Not because we know a priori that all of these things
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:56.280]   do all the things, no.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:01.280]   But if MDMA fails, it's gonna be very hard to draft.
[02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:05.100]   It'll be impossible to draft on that with commands
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:08.620]   that are more difficult to administer like psilocybin,
[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.340]   which would be next in line for alcohol use disorder,
[02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:13.020]   also major depressive disorder.
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:17.220]   So I really feel that just like everything
[02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.380]   I've talked about, whether it's networking,
[02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:24.120]   putting together for our body or trying to change
[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:29.120]   national policy and say reclassification of these compounds,
[02:07:29.120 --> 02:07:33.900]   getting them out of schedule one to some extent,
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:38.220]   you wanna break it down into its constituent pieces.
[02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:39.700]   You wanna do an 80/20 analysis,
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:41.660]   figure out what the critical few are
[02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:43.360]   and then put them in a logical sequence
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:45.220]   and execute the plan.
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.600]   One of the greatest weaknesses in the psychedelic ecosystem
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:49.300]   is there are a lot of people who just wanna do
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:51.300]   all the things and save all the people
[02:07:51.300 --> 02:07:54.140]   and all the animals and all the places all at once.
[02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:55.620]   And that just doesn't work very well.
[02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:58.660]   There are also some really good people who are executing.
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.460]   And we could talk about the for-profit side and so on.
[02:08:00.460 --> 02:08:05.140]   But I've been very, very, very pleased
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:07.740]   with the outcomes that Psi-State Foundation
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:10.620]   has been able to achieve with very limited money.
[02:08:10.620 --> 02:08:12.060]   I'm prouder of those outcomes
[02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:13.420]   than I am of the startup record.
[02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:15.740]   And the startup record's pretty good.
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:17.220]   And it's the same lens.
[02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:22.220]   I'm using the same filters and the same approach,
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:24.060]   which is kinda what I'm always looking for.
[02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.460]   I'm looking for stuff that'll translate across fields
[02:08:26.460 --> 02:08:27.300]   if possible.
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:29.860]   And then you mentioned one like TMS, I think.
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:31.700]   TMS, very interesting.
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:33.300]   - Transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:36.260]   Yeah, which at one point was more commonly used
[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:38.340]   to inhibit specific brain areas.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:40.400]   This is a non-invasive technique.
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:42.420]   I've had it done where it's over my motor cortex
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:43.260]   and you're tapping your finger
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:44.940]   and all of a sudden you can't tap your fingers.
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.580]   It's pretty eerie, but now it can be used to stimulate
[02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:50.300]   at particular frequencies, enhance neuroplasticity.
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:53.060]   And in combination with psychedelics is the,
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:54.340]   that's kind of the burning question now.
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:59.340]   Can you get a synergistic effect of TMS and psychedelics?
[02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:04.500]   Maybe not just during the psilocybin or iboga journey,
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.780]   but in the days and weeks after when we know for sure
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:09.580]   a lot of plasticity is still occurring.
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:12.900]   So keep the plasticity on board or accelerate it.
[02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:16.220]   - Yeah, so TMS also is a monotherapy.
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.860]   Very interesting to me for depression, anxiety,
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:22.980]   even substance use disorders, super interesting.
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:24.420]   And there are many different protocols,
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:26.180]   all sorts of different technology.
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:30.520]   I would say low intensity or low power ultrasound,
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:35.520]   also super interesting for various applications,
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:37.580]   potentially to addiction.
[02:09:37.580 --> 02:09:40.420]   So I'm not to be clear,
[02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:45.420]   a card carrying evangelist for psychedelics.
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:52.620]   I am a proponent of looking for high leverage uncrowded bets
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:55.640]   with limited downside and testing them out.
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:59.620]   And very optimistic about psychedelics.
[02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.300]   If anyone listening has a family history of say,
[02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:06.140]   schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder,
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.620]   which we might, which this is being very simplistic,
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:14.620]   but categorize or describe as more sort of chaotic conditions
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:19.480]   compared to hyper-rigid conditions like an OCD
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.480]   or anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, et cetera.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:27.940]   And then we can talk about why some of these psychedelics,
[02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:29.220]   at least some of the classical psychedelics
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:33.460]   seem to have cross-efficacy with multiple conditions,
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:36.580]   but psychedelics seem very helpful
[02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:39.100]   for certain types of hyper-rigidity.
[02:10:39.100 --> 02:10:41.540]   When you get into schizophrenia
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:43.260]   and borderline personality disorder,
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:46.200]   they can be really heavily contraindicated.
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.720]   Not to say that they cause those conditions,
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.860]   but they can precipitate the onset of those symptoms.
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:55.580]   And for that reason can be very destabilizing
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:58.240]   and dangerous for certain people.
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.140]   However, that's where something like metabolic psychiatry
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:05.360]   comes in and the use of ketosis and the ketogenic diet,
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:10.240]   which appears to be very effective in some patients
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:14.380]   for that grouping of say more chaotic conditions,
[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:16.240]   which is very exciting.
[02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:21.220]   So I'm interested in any tools that are off the beaten path
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:23.460]   that seem to raise interesting questions
[02:11:23.460 --> 02:11:26.580]   that have not been answered in a satisfying way
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:28.020]   yet in medicine.
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:32.480]   And I think we're still largely in the dark ages
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.380]   with respect to psychiatry.
[02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:37.940]   - Oh, I think the best psychiatrist would agree with you.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:42.940]   - Yeah, and the best psychiatrists and the best scientists
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:46.780]   and the best fill in the blank are acutely aware
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:49.500]   of the limitations of our current methods
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:51.980]   and the limitations of our current knowledge.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.580]   So I think the mark of a good thinker,
[02:11:53.580 --> 02:11:55.480]   the mark of a good scientist,
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:56.900]   the mark of a good fill in the blank,
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.860]   anything is someone who says I have no idea
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:02.260]   or we have no idea a lot.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:05.180]   - And hopefully they also say let's go figure it out
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:06.260]   or try some things.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:10.900]   And I really want to thank you for sharing that narrative,
[02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:12.280]   especially because it makes clear that you brought
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:16.520]   the same systematic process of using
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:21.420]   and asking excellent questions to arrive at solutions,
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:25.620]   to arrive at more questions, to fund areas of inquiry
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.400]   and to do it all in this really structured way.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.940]   As you said, from policy all the way down
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:34.940]   to like how many grams or X of some substance
[02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:36.340]   somebody might take.
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:40.100]   I mean, I think Matthew Johnson's laboratory at Hopkins,
[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:44.400]   Roland Griffiths, Robin Cardart Harris at UCSF,
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:46.940]   Nolan Williams, the MAPS group, Rick Doblin.
[02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:48.940]   - Peter Hendricks at University of Alabama
[02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:51.620]   looking at cocaine addiction and other things.
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:54.160]   - Yeah, you, Michael Pollan.
[02:12:54.160 --> 02:12:55.340]   I'm leaving some names out here
[02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:56.660]   and I don't want to take anything away
[02:12:56.660 --> 02:13:00.900]   from the classic as they're called,
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:03.640]   explorers of psychedelics and writers about psychedelics.
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:06.820]   But we are in the moment of a Renaissance now
[02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:08.860]   and it's important that this have a lot of fuel.
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:12.480]   So we'll put a link to your philanthropy efforts
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:15.180]   and the journalism fellowships as well
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:16.960]   because I think there's going to be a lot of interest there.
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:19.960]   And I'm huge supporter of what you're doing as you know.
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:22.620]   And I just think it's the way great science
[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:25.140]   and clinical progress is made.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:25.980]   So yeah.
[02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:27.020]   - Yeah, thanks Andrew.
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.420]   - Yeah, which brings me to another parallel topic.
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:32.460]   You know, it used to be that meditation and psychedelics
[02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:34.660]   were nested in the same territory.
[02:13:34.660 --> 02:13:36.460]   This would be in the late sixties, early seventies,
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:39.100]   the birth of places like Esalen, et cetera,
[02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:42.260]   or the consequence of the dual exploration of those things.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:47.260]   Meditation sort of escaped from the psychedelics umbrella
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:52.360]   and vice versa starting sometime in the mid two thousands
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.620]   when neuroimaging became a little bit more accessible.
[02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:57.920]   And, you know, I think nowadays if you told anybody,
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.180]   okay, you know, meditation is good for you.
[02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:03.500]   It can help ratchet down your anxiety,
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.600]   give more self-awareness, you know, improve sleep
[02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:08.780]   and on and on, maybe even give some insight
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:09.680]   into consciousness.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:11.000]   No one's going to bulk.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.660]   There's just a lot of studies or thousands of studies.
[02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:15.360]   My laboratory's done a few of them.
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:17.900]   There are other laboratories who have done far more.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:19.820]   The book "Altered Traits" is the one that comes to mind
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:23.160]   and the group out of Wisconsin was early to the game on this.
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:27.620]   In any event, you talked about TM.
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:31.340]   I'm curious from a practical standpoint,
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:33.800]   do you still meditate daily?
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:35.540]   Do you do meditation retreats?
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:39.500]   What sorts of meditative practices do you have?
[02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:41.680]   'Cause I realize this can be done walking,
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.180]   writing is its own form of meditation.
[02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:46.480]   What sorts of formal practices do you still engage in now?
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:48.680]   - Yeah, I do 10 to 20 minutes in the morning.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:53.060]   So I am not currently doing the TM twice daily, 20 minutes.
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:55.180]   I think that would be better for me, probably.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:57.260]   - Do you set a clock and you...
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:14:58.520]   - Yeah, I'll set a clock,
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:02.060]   which would be more of the concentration practice
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.020]   of say a TM where you're repeating a mantra.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:07.260]   Honestly, it could be any, in my opinion,
[02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:09.020]   some TM purists will bulk at this,
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:11.380]   but it could be really any nonsense.
[02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:12.700]   Syllable could be a word,
[02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.040]   although I think something without any attached meaning
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:17.480]   is probably more beneficial for a host of reasons.
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.360]   So it could be a concentration practice
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:20.700]   with 20 minutes of sitting.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:24.160]   It might also be a guided meditation,
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.420]   and I have no vested interest in this app,
[02:15:26.420 --> 02:15:29.880]   but I think the Waking Up app by Sam Harris is fantastic.
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.300]   I have used the introductory course,
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:36.780]   which is Sam leading you through my catnip,
[02:15:36.780 --> 02:15:39.940]   which is a logical progression of skill development
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:42.940]   from day one, two, three, and forward.
[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.580]   I have gone through that course multiple times
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:47.920]   when I'm getting back on the horse for meditation
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:49.380]   as a bit of a reboot.
[02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:50.900]   Once you develop, I think,
[02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:54.980]   a certain degree of awareness and mindfulness,
[02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:56.980]   I do think there are other activities
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:01.980]   that probably allow you the parallel experience
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:04.820]   of doing one thing while experiencing
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:06.820]   some of the benefits of meditation.
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:10.420]   And so for me, I wonder at times,
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:12.080]   are the benefits of meditation
[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.140]   the concentration practice itself?
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:17.980]   Is it just sitting still with my eyes closed,
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:19.900]   down-regulating my system a little bit,
[02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:21.740]   activating my parasympathetic,
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:25.180]   and not rushing or doing anything for 20 minutes?
[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:26.020]   Is that it?
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:27.180]   Maybe.
[02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:31.860]   Is it simply correcting my posture for 20 minutes?
[02:16:31.860 --> 02:16:34.620]   How do I weight these different inputs?
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:38.220]   And the short answer is you probably don't need to know,
[02:16:38.220 --> 02:16:43.220]   but I have found that spending time in silence in nature
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:47.340]   without anything to do,
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:50.340]   disallowing myself from doing things,
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.380]   no note-taking, no reading, et cetera,
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:56.900]   and spending, I have spent a number of extended fasts
[02:16:56.900 --> 02:16:59.720]   in nature, just water only by myself.
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.280]   No talking, no reading, no writing.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:02.580]   - What's extended?
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:04.180]   - Seven days, generally.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:05.020]   - Wow.
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:08.260]   So you're camping in nature with just water.
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:09.660]   - Yep, that's it, by myself.
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:12.500]   And there are risks associated with that, right?
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:14.160]   You got to be careful, not stupid about it,
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:19.160]   but that does a lot for me with some persistent benefits.
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:22.380]   - Are there some favorite places
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:24.180]   that you've gone into nature?
[02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:25.580]   It doesn't have to be too fast.
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:28.500]   For instance, I'm a big fan of some of the national parks
[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:29.760]   up in the Pacific Northwest,
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:32.260]   because it's like being transported to a different planet.
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:34.120]   Yosemite is obviously amazing,
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:37.700]   but any favorite spots where people
[02:17:37.700 --> 02:17:40.100]   won't go looking for you there, don't worry.
[02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:42.300]   You live in Austin all the time.
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:43.180]   - That's right, yeah.
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:48.180]   So I would say Colorado, Utah, New Mexico,
[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:52.560]   spending time in mountains, around rivers, lakes,
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:57.180]   I find very therapeutic and just gorgeous.
[02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:01.780]   I do think we suffer from odd efficiency disorder,
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:05.700]   you know, a bit of ADD when we're trapped in the mundane
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:07.860]   for too long with too much distraction,
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:12.280]   with too many to-dos, with too many relationships.
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.800]   And there's no space for awe there.
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:16.420]   There isn't the room necessary.
[02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:19.220]   Awe isn't, from my perspective,
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:22.280]   generally a quick hit that you get in the 30 seconds
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:23.640]   between using two abs.
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:26.540]   There's more breathing room required
[02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:28.880]   for genuine transcendent experience of awe.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:31.980]   So I try to, on a yearly basis,
[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:34.080]   as one of my top priorities,
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:37.040]   block out these weeks of time in nature.
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:38.840]   - Yeah, last year was the first year I did that.
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:43.640]   I went out to Colorado in August and just took daily hikes.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:44.860]   I stayed in a hotel.
[02:18:44.860 --> 02:18:47.520]   I'm not as beastie as you, doing water fasts.
[02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:51.520]   I was eating every day, but it was spectacular.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:54.560]   One thing I noticed, and I'd like to know your process on,
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:57.200]   how do you handle going back into life?
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:18:59.020]   - Great question.
[02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:01.860]   - Because those days were and are amazing.
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:05.460]   Detached and maybe one text message here or there
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:06.960]   or in between hikes or something,
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:08.320]   and then you just really clued in.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:11.620]   Even the process of watching a show at night,
[02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:13.620]   one felt so rich and like enough.
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:16.040]   So I wasn't as aesthetic as you
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:18.800]   and really cleaned all the clutter.
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:20.740]   But once you return to life,
[02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:23.560]   it's almost like you're being awash in demands.
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:26.100]   And I can see from a place of more equanimity
[02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.520]   how one could make better choices.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:29.740]   But how do you handle those transitions?
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:31.400]   - The re-entry, yeah.
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.160]   So before getting to the re-entry,
[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.800]   I think it might make sense for me to talk
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.120]   about what comes before.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:40.960]   So let's say it's like pre, during, post.
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:46.800]   Part of the reason I do these one week or longer periods
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.400]   off the grid is because it forces me
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.260]   to put better systems in place.
[02:19:52.260 --> 02:19:56.800]   So there's the benefit that you derive from say that week.
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:59.520]   And I have three weeks coming up right after this interview
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:01.320]   where I'm gonna be off the grid.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:04.240]   To set myself up for three weeks off the grid,
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.980]   I have a team, I have the podcast,
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:08.880]   I have a lot of things that are in motion
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.320]   at any given point in time.
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:15.620]   If you disappear for say a two to four week period,
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.840]   generally you cannot let the whole house catch on fire,
[02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:20.000]   then come back and put it out effectively.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.680]   Which means you need to put some policies
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:24.760]   and rules and so on in place in advance.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:28.840]   And there's a carryover effect that has a host of benefits
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:31.240]   and makes things smoother for the re-entry,
[02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:32.080]   so they're related.
[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:35.240]   Like the more you set up the pre,
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:37.280]   the easier the post is gonna be.
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:40.400]   And then you have this beautiful expansive experience
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.720]   in nature, whatever it might be,
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:45.040]   whether you're making it a suffer fest like I do
[02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:49.200]   or at a hotel at night, either way, these things can work.
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:51.000]   And nature in and of itself is super helpful.
[02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.320]   I do think that a lot of the time we like to imagine
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:58.760]   because we're driven, smart, accomplished people
[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:00.400]   that our problems are very complex.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.440]   And at the end of the day it's like,
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:04.760]   you just need some time in nature and a cold shower
[02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:08.040]   and some fucking macadamia nuts and you'll be fine.
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:10.580]   You don't need to solve all the existential dilemmas
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:13.440]   of humankind actually or fancy pharmaceuticals.
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:17.680]   So you have this experience over this week
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:22.680]   and what I will do then is set at least a,
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:26.440]   let's call it integration period of two to three days
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:31.440]   where I will slowly edge back in to my previous routine.
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:36.180]   I will not, within 12 hours of getting back
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:38.000]   to so-called civilization,
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.440]   have a day full of calls or meetings.
[02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:41.280]   I will not do that.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:42.920]   It's too much of a shock to the system
[02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:46.280]   and I think it robs you of a tail end of benefits,
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:48.200]   which would also be the case with say,
[02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.840]   fast or ketogenic diet or any number of interventions.
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:54.720]   You can squeeze out a long tail of benefits
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:56.040]   if you make a handful of changes.
[02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.060]   For instance, after an extended fast,
[02:21:58.060 --> 02:22:03.060]   what if you started with a sub caloric ketogenic diet
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:04.280]   for a few days?
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:06.560]   You get to extend some of the benefits
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:09.000]   as opposed to going straight back to say,
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.600]   a diet that includes a lot of carbohydrates.
[02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:15.160]   Similarly, when you create more of a vacuum,
[02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:20.160]   more space for awe, insight, reflection, recovery,
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:22.100]   I think you're doing yourself a disservice
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.880]   if you jump from park into sixth gear.
[02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:26.120]   And so I plan for that.
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:29.220]   And it's a function of scheduling.
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:32.200]   I also have a predictable weekly schedule.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:34.560]   So I tend to schedule podcast recordings
[02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:36.600]   on Mondays and Fridays.
[02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:39.280]   In preparation for an extended trip,
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.000]   I will batch a lot of similar activities
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.660]   that we have, say a bunch of episodes in the bank
[02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:45.500]   that are pre-scheduled.
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.480]   Everything is figured out in advance.
[02:22:47.480 --> 02:22:50.340]   And over time, the more you take these breaks,
[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:52.360]   the better your systems become.
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:55.200]   And the more liberated you are from the day to day,
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.720]   which means when you get back,
[02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:00.800]   you also don't need to rush as much into hyperactivity.
[02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:03.600]   And if you do, you know that that is more
[02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:06.900]   from a compulsivity than from a necessity.
[02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:11.400]   - While you're on these nature retreats,
[02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:13.320]   are you writing on a daily basis?
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.280]   Or are you just thinking and allowing thoughts
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.720]   to enter and leave your system?
[02:23:17.720 --> 02:23:19.540]   - Depends on the retreat.
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:21.040]   So sometimes I'm writing,
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:26.100]   but writing I think can underscore for me
[02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:30.240]   a desire to be compulsively productive.
[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:34.460]   And I think that is inversely correlated to my happiness
[02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:36.780]   or sense of wellbeing a lot of the time.
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:39.420]   So there are many areas in my life now.
[02:23:39.420 --> 02:23:42.100]   So if you were to ask me what has changed significantly
[02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:43.620]   since the time that you wrote For Our Body,
[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:48.620]   I would say that rather than looking for areas to optimize,
[02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:52.820]   I am looking where I can very deliberately
[02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:56.540]   de-optimize certain areas to increase sense of wellbeing.
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:57.500]   Where can I de-optimize?
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:59.000]   Where can I stop measuring?
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.280]   Where can I stop reading books?
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:05.820]   Which areas can I ignore completely?
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.460]   What types of information can I just excise from my life
[02:24:09.460 --> 02:24:11.620]   altogether for a period of time?
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:12.960]   Delete Twitter.
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:16.400]   Stop reading about books in X related to say AI.
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:19.180]   Or whatever it might be.
[02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:22.380]   Where can I de-optimize selectively
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:23.900]   to sort of optimize the whole?
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:24.740]   Does that make sense?
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:25.620]   - Makes good sense, yeah.
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:28.500]   - And before we started recording, I gave you a book,
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.100]   which is a short collection of poetry,
[02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:34.540]   by Halaliza Ghafouri, which is called Gold.
[02:24:34.540 --> 02:24:36.620]   It's a collection of Rumi poetry.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:40.720]   Reading poetry is an activity almost by definition,
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:45.720]   which is the antithesis of optimization.
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:48.820]   So I've tried to also integrate more of those activities
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:51.280]   into my life, and this relates to your question,
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:53.980]   because there are times when I will force myself
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:58.440]   to sit on my goddamn hands and not write, not read.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.080]   Just do the thing that is so uncomfortable sometimes,
[02:25:01.080 --> 02:25:03.080]   which is just sitting there with yourself.
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:04.380]   [laughing]
[02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:06.720]   - You know, it can be incredibly uncomfortable,
[02:25:06.720 --> 02:25:09.580]   in part because of the fear
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:11.700]   that it could become comfortable,
[02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:15.780]   especially for proactive people with a strong,
[02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:18.500]   to use Paul Conte's words, generative drive.
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:19.740]   You know, you're going to,
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:24.500]   which is a good thing, I believe.
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:28.080]   - It's a good thing, and it can be a good thing.
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:33.080]   It can indicate really incredible adaptations.
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:39.240]   It can also sometimes, I think, indicate maladaptations.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.440]   Right, and so I think it's helpful to take a break
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:46.320]   from that generative drive, or at least just put it
[02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:51.080]   in park position to see if that generative drive
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:56.080]   is perhaps indicative of you leaning towards something
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:01.880]   in a healthy, proactive way versus running from something
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:05.180]   in a long-term, destructive way.
[02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:06.560]   - Yeah, well, and I think Paul would say
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:10.960]   that part of the generative drive process is peace,
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.240]   you know, not necessarily even as a still state,
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:17.160]   but as a, you know, being able to experience peace
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:19.320]   even in the transitions, and there's a lot more
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:21.120]   to say about that, and he would say it far better
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:24.480]   than I ever would, so I'll leave it at that.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:27.160]   - I mean, for people who have the option,
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.920]   getting in nature, it doesn't have to be all day,
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.040]   every day on a water fast.
[02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:32.360]   I just take certain things to an extreme,
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:33.580]   because that's who I am, but--
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:34.840]   - Sorry, when you say water fast,
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:37.080]   that means fasting with water.
[02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:37.920]   - Right.
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:39.520]   - Fasting, but yes, drinking water.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:41.000]   - It just means you're allowed to have water
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:41.840]   and nothing else.
[02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.320]   - For a long time, I thought it meant
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.660]   that you're not drinking water.
[02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:46.000]   - Oh, yeah, no, don't do that.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.320]   - Some people do that, right?
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:50.340]   They do these crazy food water fasts as a way,
[02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:53.020]   I think they believe it clears senescent cells or something,
[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:56.440]   but probably clears a lot more than just senescent cells.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:59.960]   - Yeah, there might be something to it.
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:01.560]   I mean, like there are people who recycle
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:04.320]   by drinking their own urine, not my jam,
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:07.840]   but I would say it's like three hours without shelter,
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.920]   three days without water, three weeks without food.
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:14.360]   General rule of thumb, so be careful with dehydration.
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:16.440]   You can go a long time without food.
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:17.560]   I don't care how ripped you are.
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:19.720]   You got 8% body fat, man, you got plenty of time.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:21.680]   You can go a couple weeks, no problem.
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:22.760]   - Yeah, you got calories stocked away.
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:24.800]   - 9,000 calories per pound stored body fat,
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:26.200]   you got plenty, don't worry.
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:32.560]   So for people who have the option to be in nature
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:37.560]   and just exercise several hours a day to exhaustion,
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.640]   see how many of your problems seem to just go away.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:43.000]   Just try that.
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.860]   - Yeah, well, my Sunday routine is to try and get outside
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:48.680]   and move as much as possible.
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:49.720]   I don't always succeed,
[02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:54.300]   but I'm going to try a longer retreat into nature.
[02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:59.000]   I think Olympic National Forest is calling me again.
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.360]   It seems like once a year, I just want to get back up there.
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.120]   - It's calling, you should get back out there.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.800]   - Spectacular.
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:09.080]   I have a question about mentors.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.840]   I'm a big believer in mentors,
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:13.780]   either mentors that know us and we know them
[02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:15.920]   or people that we assign as mentors
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:18.860]   without them realizing it, this sort of thing.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:22.960]   Do you have mentors at this stage of life
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.380]   for particular areas of life?
[02:28:25.380 --> 02:28:27.960]   Are you mentoring yourself?
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:32.560]   Are you flying with a few voices in your head
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.760]   that serve you well?
[02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:34.980]   Who are your mentors?
[02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:38.740]   - I definitely have people I consider mentors.
[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:43.460]   I think at this point, rarely one way
[02:28:43.460 --> 02:28:47.200]   in the sense that they tend to be friends.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:50.220]   I spend time with, they get something from it,
[02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:51.460]   I get something from it.
[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:53.000]   Not in a transactional way,
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:57.560]   but they find it fun or beneficial or amusing.
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:59.880]   In some way, redeeming to spend time with me.
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:00.920]   - That's the hope.
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:04.080]   How is that different from traditional friendship,
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:05.440]   your standard friendship?
[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:09.600]   Are you spending time with some orientation
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:13.980]   toward their embodying areas of life
[02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:15.760]   that you would like to emulate?
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.600]   - Totally.
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:21.600]   I spend time around people I hope to be more like
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:24.200]   in some way, because guess what?
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:28.060]   You're going to average into, say,
[02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:32.660]   just the sum, holistic whole of the five or six people
[02:29:32.660 --> 02:29:33.600]   you spend the most time with.
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:34.920]   So you should choose that very carefully.
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:38.000]   That includes virtual parasocial relationships.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.300]   Okay, if you're listening to a fill-in-the-blank person
[02:29:41.300 --> 02:29:43.640]   for four hours a week, five hours a week,
[02:29:43.640 --> 02:29:48.640]   two hours a week, whoever that group is comprised of
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.480]   is going to influence who you become.
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:55.480]   And for me then, I think carefully about my friendships.
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:58.560]   And they could be older, like Kevin Kelly,
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:00.120]   who's become a good friend,
[02:30:00.120 --> 02:30:05.480]   who has a wealth of life experience that I don't have.
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.200]   And so I might just call him and say,
[02:30:07.200 --> 02:30:08.360]   "Kevin, I have a question for you."
[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:10.000]   But I do that with my younger friends too.
[02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.360]   And they could be younger than I am,
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:14.480]   and I might still view them as a mentor in X, Y, or Z.
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:18.440]   I think mentor has a heavy weight to it.
[02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:23.440]   It has a connotation of maybe never-ending,
[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:26.800]   time-consuming obligation.
[02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:29.240]   So I would never, for instance,
[02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:30.360]   and I know a lot of people try this,
[02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:32.540]   ask someone to be my mentor.
[02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:33.380]   It's like, "Would you like to be
[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:34.720]   my free life coach forever?"
[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:37.800]   You know, that's kind of how it sounds to the recipient.
[02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:39.160]   - It sounds very formal.
[02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:40.520]   - Yeah, it sounds very formal.
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:44.600]   So for me, I would say there have certainly been mentors.
[02:30:44.600 --> 02:30:47.480]   I've had wrestling coaches, I've had teachers,
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:51.120]   I've had resident advisors who are reverents,
[02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:52.720]   who had a huge impact on my life,
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:54.920]   and followed up with me and paid attention to me
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:59.920]   and cared for me in more of a one-directional sense.
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:04.120]   I view myself as the beneficiary.
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:06.280]   Of course, they certainly got something out of it
[02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:08.600]   if they had that job, and they probably found it
[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.840]   to be very gratifying in its own way.
[02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:13.920]   And teachers like Professor Ed Shao at Princeton,
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:16.560]   I feel incredibly indebted to.
[02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:22.280]   These days, and for a long time,
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:26.680]   I've believed that you can learn something powerful
[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:31.200]   from almost anyone, probably anyone you interact with.
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.960]   Could be an Uber driver, could be someone
[02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:36.000]   taking garbage out of a restaurant.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.840]   If you really take the time to dig, you can find something.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:43.840]   And before you can, I think as an adult,
[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:49.320]   effectively think about who you would like to learn from,
[02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:50.400]   if I put it that way.
[02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:54.000]   It's helpful to have a baseline of self-awareness
[02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.520]   that you know what you might want to work on
[02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:01.760]   to either amplify strengths, develop skills,
[02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:03.160]   address weaknesses.
[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:05.080]   And so, for instance, one of my close friends,
[02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:07.320]   Matt Mullenweg, he's younger than I am.
[02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:11.560]   He's the founder of Automattic, which runs WordPress.com.
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:13.720]   He is the lead developer of WordPress,
[02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:15.280]   although it was an open-source project, of course,
[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:17.240]   with many, many contributors.
[02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:19.080]   He was one of the lead developers,
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:21.960]   now powers something like 32% of the internet.
[02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:26.960]   And he exemplifies a cool and calm temperament,
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:32.400]   even in the most chaotic periods imaginable,
[02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:35.040]   during the most chaotic events imaginable.
[02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:39.640]   And when I find myself getting dysregulated,
[02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:43.360]   to use a fancy term, losing my shit,
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:45.880]   or getting carried away by emotion,
[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:48.520]   getting righteously angry, or whatever it might be,
[02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:50.120]   and I recognize at some point
[02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:51.960]   that it's really not serving me,
[02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:55.280]   that I am being owned by the emotion, right?
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:58.560]   Like, I'm the dog on the leash, not the other way around.
[02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:00.000]   Then I think of Matt.
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.080]   I'm like, what would Matt do?
[02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:04.200]   What advice would Matt give me right now?
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:07.400]   How would Matt act in these circumstances?
[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:11.120]   And I do that with many friends.
[02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:15.000]   I also think a lot about,
[02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.600]   and this is borrowing from someone named Kathy Sierra,
[02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.240]   from a long time ago,
[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:22.240]   focusing more on just-in-time information
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:24.400]   as opposed to just-in-case information.
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.400]   So just-in-case information is like,
[02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:27.560]   I'm gonna read these 20 books,
[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:31.760]   'cause in two years I might be interested in X, Y, and Z.
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:34.400]   That, I think, is often a waste of time,
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.200]   because if it ever becomes relevant,
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:38.280]   you're just gonna have to reread those books.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.560]   People do the same thing with humans.
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:42.920]   They're like, I wanna meet so-and-so
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:44.320]   and have them as my mentor,
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:47.720]   because maybe five years from now I'll do X, Y, and Z,
[02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:50.200]   and then they'll be useful for ABC.
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:51.520]   That's too speculative,
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:53.680]   and I think it ends up in a lot of wasted energy.
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:56.760]   So the podcast, for me,
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:00.520]   writing the books and doing the interviews,
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:02.280]   even prior to the podcast,
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:04.160]   becoming involved with startups,
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:08.600]   delving into the world of science and scientists,
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:12.200]   all helps me to develop a confidence
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:17.200]   that almost any question I could ask,
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:20.160]   I can find some semblance of an answer for
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:21.920]   by just reaching out to a few people and saying,
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:25.160]   who do you know who might be able to answer this?
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:27.280]   And that's very reassuring,
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:31.720]   and it relieves some of the anxiety or pressure
[02:34:31.720 --> 02:34:33.240]   that people might feel
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:35.600]   to assemble some personal board of directors
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:39.200]   of X men and women who can help them with everything.
[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:44.040]   And then there are people I hire to be accountable to.
[02:34:44.040 --> 02:34:48.040]   So I might work with coaches, therapists, and so on,
[02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:49.960]   who I would view as mentors.
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:52.640]   They just happen to get paid for it.
[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.880]   - Yeah, the reason I ask the question
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:56.400]   is because we were talking about the meditative process
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.240]   going into nature,
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:34:59.200]   and even with psychedelics,
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:01.760]   it can be viewed a lot of different ways,
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:04.840]   but I think of them largely as going inward to explore.
[02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.600]   I mean, you're out in nature and learning from nature.
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:11.520]   There's such a core truth to nature.
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:13.760]   I know that sounds a little bit, you know,
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:17.880]   wishy washy, but it's true.
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:21.400]   Like if it's there, it's concrete, it's really something.
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:22.860]   It was there long before any of us,
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:24.080]   and it'll be there a lot longer
[02:35:24.080 --> 02:35:27.440]   than any of us will ever be, we hope.
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:30.440]   Certainly if it goes, we go.
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.920]   But the process of learning from others
[02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:36.240]   and paying attention to others
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:37.720]   is really an outward looking thing.
[02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:38.920]   I mean, we have to bring that in,
[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.000]   but I was just curious how you balance those
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.720]   and as a way to really understand
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:46.120]   not just your time allocation, right?
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:47.620]   I think we could talk about that.
[02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.840]   You know, how's your morning structured, et cetera,
[02:35:49.840 --> 02:35:53.000]   which I think there's great value in knowing,
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:56.680]   but more what's your mind allocation?
[02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:58.840]   Right, I think about this, you know, like where's my brain?
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:01.200]   Is it, am I focused on what's going on in here?
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.120]   And, you know, is there a need to excavate there?
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:06.560]   Sure, you know, but how much time am I out of my head
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:08.600]   and bringing things in from the outside world
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:09.760]   and back and forth?
[02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:13.600]   So do you have some sense of across the year,
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:17.000]   across the day, how you mind allocate?
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.160]   I don't know if that's the best phrase,
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:20.760]   but I can't think of any better one.
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.840]   If you can think of a better one, please, please table it.
[02:36:23.840 --> 02:36:25.400]   'Cause I'm happy to use that.
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:27.720]   - How do I think about mind allocation
[02:36:27.720 --> 02:36:29.980]   or attention allocation?
[02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:35.980]   - I try to, and most frequently think of my mind share
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:45.260]   across a year and across a week, a weekly timeframe.
[02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:52.460]   And I find that to be manageable
[02:36:52.460 --> 02:36:56.420]   in the sense that on a yearly basis,
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:02.260]   on New Year's Eve or roughly around New Year's,
[02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:06.420]   every year I'll do a past year review, PYR,
[02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:08.140]   past year review, where I'll go back
[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:09.980]   and I'll look at my entire last year,
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:12.580]   piece of paper in front of me,
[02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:15.700]   line down the center, plus negative.
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:19.220]   And I will go through every week in my calendar
[02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:22.140]   for the previous year, and I'll write down
[02:37:22.140 --> 02:37:27.140]   the people, places, activities, commitments, et cetera,
[02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:33.460]   that produced peak positive emotional experiences.
[02:37:33.460 --> 02:37:36.020]   So, all right, we're doing an 80/20 analysis here.
[02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:38.180]   Like, what are the big rocks that really moved the needle
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:39.500]   in a meaningful way?
[02:37:39.500 --> 02:37:42.900]   And conversely, who are the people, what are the things,
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:47.180]   what are the places that just made me go, ugh?
[02:37:47.180 --> 02:37:50.220]   And we're draining produced peak negative experiences.
[02:37:50.220 --> 02:37:53.740]   Why the hell did I commit to this type experiences?
[02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:58.500]   And that presents me with a do more of, do less of list.
[02:37:58.500 --> 02:38:01.820]   Then I look forward to the next year, and I did this,
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:03.340]   I suppose, just a handful of months ago,
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.620]   around New Year's, with the positive.
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:09.220]   I'm like, okay, here's my list of do more of.
[02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:11.380]   It's not real until it's in the calendar.
[02:38:11.380 --> 02:38:13.260]   Let's get these things in the calendar.
[02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:16.340]   And then I'll start talking to people, booking things,
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:20.100]   having people help with organizing if that is required,
[02:38:20.100 --> 02:38:21.660]   and getting things blocked out.
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:25.100]   So I have already, this year,
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:28.140]   and we're in the reasonable beginning stages of the year,
[02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:32.180]   I have things blocked out until November of this year.
[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:36.660]   And those provide the breaks in the action,
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:38.580]   not just the breaks in the action, but the fun stuff.
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:41.500]   Because by the way, guys, I thought for a long time,
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:42.900]   like, yeah, you take care of A, B, and C,
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:44.700]   and the good stuff just takes care of itself.
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:48.900]   I have, I do not any longer believe that to be true.
[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:51.260]   Unless you schedule these things that you claim
[02:38:51.260 --> 02:38:54.780]   are important, they're gonna get crowded out by bullshit.
[02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:58.740]   And maybe not bullshit, but just less important things.
[02:38:58.740 --> 02:39:01.180]   The urgent will crush the important.
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:03.260]   So I get these things on the calendar,
[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:07.660]   and then I back up and I look at optimal weekly
[02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:13.140]   mind allocation, right, attentional allocation.
[02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:18.140]   And there's an incredible cost to cognitive switching.
[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:20.540]   If you're just task switching all day.
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:25.540]   So I will try my best to format a weekly rhythm,
[02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:30.220]   a weekly sequence that allows me to focus
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:32.820]   on certain types of tasks.
[02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:37.100]   So Monday is very frequently admin of some type.
[02:39:37.100 --> 02:39:39.500]   Just bits and ends, flotsam jetsam,
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:43.540]   all the miscellaneous pieces that are part of life,
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:44.780]   you gotta deal with them.
[02:39:44.780 --> 02:39:45.980]   That tends to be Monday.
[02:39:46.860 --> 02:39:50.220]   Whenever possible, and especially if I am focused
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:53.140]   on physical activity, let's just say I'm in a place
[02:39:53.140 --> 02:39:57.980]   like Colorado, I will try to schedule most of that
[02:39:57.980 --> 02:40:02.860]   for after lunch to ensure that I get in a lot of exercise
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:04.860]   and movement in the first portion of the day.
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:06.900]   Not everybody has that ability, but I will say
[02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:10.260]   more of you have that capacity than you might think,
[02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:13.620]   because most of what we all do is just not important.
[02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:16.620]   - Time on social media first thing in the morning
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:19.940]   is probably the most poisonous activity
[02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:22.260]   that I could take part in.
[02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:25.060]   I don't want to point fingers at anyone else,
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:29.180]   but I think if people ask, what is the amount of time
[02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:32.100]   it takes to get in a really good workout?
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:34.140]   It's going to be about an hour,
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:36.780]   but a lot can be done in 45 for even 30 minutes.
[02:40:36.780 --> 02:40:39.260]   You think about how quickly that time goes by.
[02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:42.580]   - Yeah, I'm sure I'm not the only one
[02:40:42.580 --> 02:40:44.720]   that is part of the reason I deleted
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:45.720]   a lot of these apps from my phone.
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:48.460]   It's like I'd go into the bathroom
[02:40:48.460 --> 02:40:51.260]   to take a quick bit of business,
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:53.860]   and then 45 minutes later, I'm like,
[02:40:53.860 --> 02:40:56.240]   how have I been looking at Instagram for 45 minutes?
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:58.780]   - Lines for restrooms have gotten very long
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:00.540]   in the last 10 years.
[02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:01.620]   Has anyone noticed that?
[02:41:01.620 --> 02:41:03.720]   The wait for the restrooms has gotten very long.
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:06.920]   - So you have time for the important stuff, I think,
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:09.800]   and just look at some of the extreme overtures out there.
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:12.380]   They have the same amount of time that you do.
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:13.340]   - I was going to ask this later,
[02:41:13.340 --> 02:41:16.300]   but I'll just quickly interject this now.
[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:19.200]   I saw, perhaps it was on Twitter,
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:20.320]   or maybe I overheard this,
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:22.840]   that you're back on Instagram.
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:26.840]   I mean, you've always had an account that posts,
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.160]   but are you back in there?
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:29.740]   Are you out of there?
[02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:31.600]   - I mean, look, the dirty little secret,
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:33.340]   I'm single again, and that's a great way
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:37.140]   to connect with eligible ladies who might be of interest.
[02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:40.180]   - Got it, so you're on Instagram.
[02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:42.940]   - I'm willing to pay the tax of dealing
[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:47.220]   with the brain damage of using Instagram as a result.
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:51.580]   - Look, finding a great life partner is great.
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:54.700]   - So that is the reason for that,
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:58.400]   but otherwise, it would not be on my phone.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.100]   - It wouldn't even be on your phone.
[02:42:00.100 --> 02:42:02.520]   - Absolutely not, it's too well designed.
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:03.540]   These companies are very smart.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:04.980]   They have very good data scientists.
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:07.420]   They have very good UI specialists.
[02:42:07.420 --> 02:42:10.020]   If anyone out there thinks that they can,
[02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:13.140]   maybe Jaco can can discipline his way through it.
[02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:15.660]   I'm sure he can because he is Jaco,
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:18.180]   but in my case and in the case of most people,
[02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:19.760]   you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:22.880]   If you think you can use your self-control
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:27.500]   to keep your use of Instagram to say 10 minutes at a clip,
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:30.300]   good luck, and even if you can,
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:31.620]   people say, ah, but I do that anyway.
[02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:33.340]   I'm like, all right, how much time do you spend
[02:42:33.340 --> 02:42:36.700]   sending memes and links from Instagram
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:39.220]   or fill in the blank platform to your friends in group chat?
[02:42:39.220 --> 02:42:41.200]   How much time does that consume?
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:43.320]   - I spend a fair amount of time on Instagram and Twitter
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:44.980]   posting things related to the podcast,
[02:42:44.980 --> 02:42:47.460]   but I don't have someone to do that for me,
[02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:49.040]   and I actually enjoy doing it,
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:50.960]   and it challenges me in certain ways,
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:53.060]   but I completely agree with everything you're saying.
[02:42:53.060 --> 02:42:54.700]   I also want to note that you didn't say
[02:42:54.700 --> 02:42:58.420]   that you're on Twitter possibly to meet somebody,
[02:42:58.420 --> 02:43:00.660]   which is more a statement about Twitter.
[02:43:00.660 --> 02:43:04.020]   - Yeah, it's not the friendliest neighborhood I've found,
[02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:08.320]   and I would say Twitter has its use cases.
[02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:10.340]   I find it useful in some respects.
[02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:14.000]   It has become much less useful and much less practical
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.560]   in the last year with a lot of the product changes,
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.940]   but it has its place.
[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:19.980]   It's not on my phone.
[02:43:19.980 --> 02:43:22.840]   It was on my phone for a very brief period of time.
[02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:27.840]   I do not want, I find that my ability to be still and calm
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:35.140]   is eroded if I am too easily able to escape boredom.
[02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:38.800]   If you cease to have the ability to be bored
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:40.120]   for five to 10 minutes,
[02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:42.160]   I think that makes you very fragile.
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:45.480]   It makes you very easy to manipulate also,
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:47.920]   and there are a lot of forces at play online
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:50.240]   that want to manipulate or shape your behavior
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.080]   in different ways,
[02:43:51.080 --> 02:43:53.920]   so I feel like it is imperative for me
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:58.240]   to cultivate the ability to just sit still
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:01.640]   and not consume the five minutes in line,
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:05.260]   waiting to get into a restaurant by hopping on Twitter
[02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:06.740]   or Instagram.
[02:44:06.740 --> 02:44:09.380]   So that's part of the reason they're not on my phone.
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:11.900]   Could you tell us about Cockpunch?
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:13.980]   (laughs)
[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:15.700]   Yeah, I can tell you about Cockpunch.
[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:19.500]   So Cockpunch is a creative project
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:24.500]   intended once again to make me less precious
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:29.980]   about protecting whatever brand, I think it's called,
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:32.540]   and I think I might have.
[02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:37.200]   And this is an investment in my long-term mental health also,
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.360]   and I think in my career flexibility,
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:41.000]   my willingness to experiment.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:44.400]   Cockpunch could be a long story,
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.180]   but the gist of it is I wanted to experiment
[02:44:48.180 --> 02:44:49.020]   with fiction writing.
[02:44:49.020 --> 02:44:52.080]   I've been saying this for years, and I've never done it.
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:44:53.800]   That's the backdrop.
[02:44:53.800 --> 02:44:57.560]   On top of that, I have wanted to get back into illustration
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:44:58.900]   and work in the visual arts,
[02:44:58.900 --> 02:45:01.780]   which I did for a long time when I was younger,
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:04.480]   and I've not done that consistently.
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:05.320]   Why not?
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:06.700]   Because I haven't had accountability,
[02:45:06.700 --> 02:45:09.420]   I haven't had deadlines, it hasn't been in the calendar.
[02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:13.220]   This should sound somewhat familiar by now.
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:16.780]   And at the same time, I was becoming very interested
[02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:19.860]   in Web3 and what was happening in the world of NFTs.
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:23.260]   This is probably 2020, and I know they've developed
[02:45:23.260 --> 02:45:26.160]   a fairly negative connotation for a lot of good reasons.
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.760]   But I started to think about fundraising
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.800]   for early-stage science.
[02:45:32.800 --> 02:45:37.220]   And if I could do, if I could conduct an experiment
[02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:41.040]   as a proof of concept with different novel approaches
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:45.640]   to fundraising, so rather than just calling the rich friends
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:49.780]   who might sort of bend to the pressure (laughs)
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:53.500]   or be willing to fund, I wanted to look at, say,
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.200]   crowdfunding back in the day.
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:57.260]   Then I wanted to look at different options
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:45:58.700]   for perhaps art auctions.
[02:45:58.700 --> 02:46:01.380]   And I was gonna do this with contemporary art.
[02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:04.100]   This is many years ago, and in the process
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:07.140]   of wanting to fund the Hopkins Center
[02:46:07.140 --> 02:46:09.700]   focused on psychedelic and consciousness research,
[02:46:09.700 --> 02:46:12.520]   which was the first of its kind in the United States.
[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:19.020]   And the technology gave me the opportunity
[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:22.460]   to learn about a new, let's just call it,
[02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:26.080]   set of technologies, so to develop skills and knowledge.
[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:28.840]   It would give me the opportunity to reconnect
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:30.560]   and deepen friendships with a number
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:34.400]   of my very, very smart friends who were playing in that area.
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:38.000]   Also test fundraising, also get back into fiction
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.320]   and art and all that combined into this thing
[02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:43.080]   that I ended up calling Cockpunch because it made me laugh.
[02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:43.980]   And you know what?
[02:46:43.980 --> 02:46:47.880]   Man, if you take your work too seriously,
[02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:49.260]   you're gonna burn out before you get
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:51.080]   the really serious work done.
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:53.260]   And I think it was Bertrand Russell who said,
[02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:56.120]   "It's a sure sign of an impending nervous breakdown
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:58.120]   "if you start taking your work too seriously,
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:01.060]   "or believing your work to be very, very serious."
[02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:06.060]   And for that reason, I wanted to give it an absurd name
[02:47:06.060 --> 02:47:12.080]   that would also have some word of mouth benefit.
[02:47:12.080 --> 02:47:15.660]   And that too, see what would happen.
[02:47:15.660 --> 02:47:16.820]   Honestly, just see what would happen.
[02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.500]   'Cause I was like, all right, look,
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:20.860]   what is honestly the worst thing that happens?
[02:47:20.860 --> 02:47:22.180]   Like people write a bunch of pieces
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:24.060]   where they're like shaking their fist at the sky.
[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:28.000]   How dare Tim Ferriss create a project called Cockpunch?
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.440]   - You could turn it around on them and just say
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:31.860]   that what they were doing is a cockpunch.
[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:34.140]   - No, well, I-- - Attempting, attempting.
[02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:36.660]   - Well, that was kind of the thing.
[02:47:36.660 --> 02:47:38.260]   That was kind of part of the thinking
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:40.420]   that it would just be entertaining to watch people
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:43.300]   seriously trying to critique something called Cockpunch.
[02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:48.320]   And the upshot of that is it raised almost $2 million,
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.780]   sold out in something like 30 minutes or 40 minutes
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:52.840]   for the foundation.
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.080]   All that money went to Sisam Foundation.
[02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:57.200]   All of that money has already been distributed
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.360]   in the form of grants.
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:47:59.200]   - Wonderful.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:04.200]   - And along the way, I got to work with artists,
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:07.740]   with programmers, learn new technologies,
[02:48:07.740 --> 02:48:10.540]   reconnect with old friends, and now we're back in touch.
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:13.700]   And it's extremely fun to be back in touch with these folks.
[02:48:13.700 --> 02:48:18.240]   And I've written the equivalent of a short book
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:20.340]   in fiction in the form of short stories
[02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:23.820]   that are this fantasy world-building exercise for me.
[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:24.900]   And I'm having a blast.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.620]   So I'm exercising new creative muscles
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:31.260]   that has led me back into the worlds of comic books,
[02:48:31.260 --> 02:48:33.260]   which I haven't created yet,
[02:48:33.260 --> 02:48:35.800]   led me back into the worlds of gaming,
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:38.700]   led me back into my fascination with tabletop gaming
[02:48:38.700 --> 02:48:40.940]   'cause I played D&D forever when I was a kid.
[02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:43.580]   That was my refuge as a runt who got the crap kicked out
[02:48:43.580 --> 02:48:45.300]   of him left and right.
[02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:47.860]   And I'm having just a blast.
[02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:52.860]   And the takeaway, I think, on some level
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:56.560]   is that you should do things,
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:00.500]   should is a loaded term.
[02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:04.340]   It's helpful for me to consider doing things
[02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:05.960]   that give me energy, right?
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:08.680]   Because if we say, all right, time management is fine,
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:11.900]   but time doesn't really have any practical value
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:13.500]   unless you have attention, right?
[02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:15.420]   So then there's attentional management.
[02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:19.740]   But that attention is limited also physically
[02:49:19.740 --> 02:49:22.740]   and sort of metaphorically by energy, right?
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:25.020]   So you have like substrates, diets,
[02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:26.680]   neurotransmitters, and so on.
[02:49:26.680 --> 02:49:30.960]   If you do not have the basic batteries required,
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:35.960]   the rest of the things that are higher up on that pyramid
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:38.420]   can't really be executed properly.
[02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:39.540]   So for me, it's like, okay,
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:42.060]   let's say "Cock Punch" doesn't do anything.
[02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:43.020]   It's total failure, right?
[02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:43.860]   Coming back to like--
[02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:45.800]   - It already raised $2 million for science.
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:46.640]   - It did.
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:48.020]   - And that science could be breakthrough science.
[02:49:48.020 --> 02:49:49.300]   - It could, it could.
[02:49:49.300 --> 02:49:52.040]   - "Cock Punch," sorry, I yelled, I'm sorry.
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.260]   So "Cock Punch" is at least thus far a success.
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:49:57.400]   - It is.
[02:49:57.400 --> 02:49:59.220]   But coming back to Seth Godin's question,
[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:00.700]   I asked myself, would I do this
[02:50:00.700 --> 02:50:03.500]   even if it turns out to be a complete failure financially?
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:04.560]   And I was like, yes,
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:07.660]   because I think the relationships and the skills,
[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:09.780]   even if this quote unquote fails
[02:50:09.780 --> 02:50:11.660]   from the outside looking in,
[02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.800]   those will transcend this project
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:17.780]   and be life-affirming and helpful and fun in other areas.
[02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:18.820]   And that's proven to be true,
[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:21.180]   even though the project is ongoing.
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:25.260]   And I have more energy now
[02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:27.840]   because of this ridiculous project.
[02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:29.860]   I'm very proud of the fiction, actually.
[02:50:29.860 --> 02:50:31.740]   This ridiculous project called "Cock Punch."
[02:50:31.740 --> 02:50:33.460]   People can find the legend of "Cock Punch"
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:37.320]   on any fine provider of podcasts.
[02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:41.420]   And hired voice actors did the scripting, the production.
[02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:44.340]   I hit number one fiction worldwide on Apple Podcasts
[02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:46.020]   for a while, the whole thing's hilarious.
[02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:48.380]   - And if you could, can you explain a little bit
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:50.800]   about the characters in "Cock Punch"?
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:51.640]   - Yeah, I can.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:52.960]   - Who's punching who's cock?
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:53.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:55.220]   - Or which cocks are punching?
[02:50:55.220 --> 02:50:57.860]   - Yeah, which cocks are punching which, how does this work?
[02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:00.180]   So here we go.
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:03.220]   All right, so the legend of "Cock Punch"
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:06.340]   takes place in this realm called Varlata.
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:10.680]   And Varlata is being described through the narrator
[02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:13.240]   who we know as the seventh scribe.
[02:51:13.240 --> 02:51:14.760]   We don't know much about the seventh scribe,
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:17.220]   but the seventh scribe makes an appearance in episode one
[02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:21.660]   as the reliable but possibly sometimes unreliable narrator
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:22.640]   of this space.
[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:25.180]   And there's a mind-bending time component
[02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:27.280]   where there's something called restarts.
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:28.760]   Something like "The Edge of Tomorrow,"
[02:51:28.760 --> 02:51:31.600]   if people have ever seen this movie, where time restarts.
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:34.320]   Maybe like "Groundhog Day," time restarts.
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:38.000]   And it's unclear as of yet in the story why that is the case
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.380]   but people basically snap into being.
[02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:42.540]   They know who they are and what they do,
[02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:46.380]   but they have no real memories to speak of.
[02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:49.680]   So the world is constantly being reconstructed
[02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:51.660]   and pieced together by these scribes,
[02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:53.880]   the seventh of which is the narrator.
[02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:57.860]   So you might read into this that I am a fan of fantasy,
[02:51:57.860 --> 02:52:01.380]   Tolkien, you name it, Ursula K. Le Guin,
[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:03.460]   "The Wizard of Earthsea," et cetera.
[02:52:03.460 --> 02:52:06.800]   Then there are eight primary houses.
[02:52:06.800 --> 02:52:08.360]   These are the greater houses.
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.240]   Some might call them clans
[02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:12.240]   and they have different characteristics.
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:16.520]   Just prior to the seventh scribe beginning
[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:17.880]   his piecing together,
[02:52:17.880 --> 02:52:19.880]   which turns into the story in the podcast,
[02:52:19.880 --> 02:52:21.240]   there was a warring states period,
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.720]   this much he's been able to establish.
[02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:27.960]   And the peacekeeping mechanism that was devised
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:29.980]   is something called the Great Games.
[02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:34.980]   And the Great Games is a combat competition.
[02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:40.320]   And the eight greater houses send their best fighters
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:42.460]   who've been vetted through preliminary competitions
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:45.240]   to the Great Games, which is in the free trade zone,
[02:52:45.240 --> 02:52:47.960]   which is this one place where all of the races mingle
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:49.180]   and trade and so on.
[02:52:49.180 --> 02:52:51.680]   And all of these characters
[02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:54.780]   happen to be anthropomorphized roosters.
[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:59.780]   So they have generally each one gauntlet of some type.
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:04.240]   And clearly they punch each other with this gauntlet
[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.780]   and there are many other types of weapons.
[02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:10.640]   So the colloquial nickname for this Olympics of combat
[02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:12.300]   is cockpunch.
[02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:16.800]   And that is the etymology, so the scholars say,
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:19.980]   of cockpunch, the legend of cockpunch.
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:21.540]   And there's a lot more to it.
[02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:22.640]   And there are many wrinkles,
[02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:25.380]   a lot of Easter eggs in this entire story.
[02:53:25.380 --> 02:53:27.140]   The idea came to me and it started off
[02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:28.220]   as a bit of a farce, right?
[02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:31.780]   It was just gonna be something funny, see if it works.
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:35.220]   Maybe it raises some money, very light lift.
[02:53:35.220 --> 02:53:36.560]   But once I got into the fiction,
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:38.040]   I started taking it super seriously.
[02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:40.440]   So it's become very, very elaborate.
[02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:42.700]   It's become really, really elaborate.
[02:53:42.700 --> 02:53:44.680]   And I'm loving it, it's great.
[02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:46.580]   So who knows where it'll go.
[02:53:46.580 --> 02:53:47.420]   I have no idea.
[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:48.660]   That's part of the reason why I called it
[02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:51.220]   an emergent long fiction project.
[02:53:51.220 --> 02:53:52.740]   I didn't call it an NFT project.
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:55.060]   I was like, this is an emergent long fiction project
[02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:57.860]   where I'm taking inputs from the audience.
[02:53:57.860 --> 02:54:00.320]   I'm watching very closely what people understand
[02:54:00.320 --> 02:54:02.100]   or don't understand or find interesting.
[02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:04.420]   I'm looking at, for instance, what is generated
[02:54:04.420 --> 02:54:07.700]   when I host an AI-assisted art competition,
[02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:09.600]   which I did with the fans.
[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:12.380]   And a lot of these bits and pieces get integrated
[02:54:12.380 --> 02:54:14.300]   in some fashion into this thing
[02:54:14.300 --> 02:54:18.140]   that chapter by chapter is coalescing.
[02:54:18.140 --> 02:54:19.280]   So that's Cockpunch.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:21.240]   - Amazing.
[02:54:21.240 --> 02:54:23.080]   - And I had to buy cockpunch.com
[02:54:23.080 --> 02:54:24.800]   and the @cockpunch Twitter.
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:27.640]   (laughing)
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:28.720]   - You had to buy it from somebody?
[02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.220]   - Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:31.060]   - The whole process.
[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.780]   - I don't want to ask what it was being used for
[02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:33.820]   prior to your purchase.
[02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:36.620]   - It was not being used for fantasy world building.
[02:54:36.620 --> 02:54:37.460]   I'll put it that way.
[02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:38.780]   - Got it.
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:39.640]   Amazing.
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:41.860]   And for so many reasons, I have so much to say,
[02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:45.900]   but first of all, your excitement about it is tangible.
[02:54:45.900 --> 02:54:49.460]   The energy you have around it is infectious.
[02:54:49.460 --> 02:54:55.860]   And while I don't want to go into the total depth
[02:54:55.860 --> 02:54:59.820]   and contour of what Paul Conti has been telling me
[02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:03.300]   over the last week of preparing this mental health series
[02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:05.460]   about what's really great in life
[02:55:05.460 --> 02:55:06.480]   that we all should cultivate,
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:08.580]   it has a lot to do with this generative drive,
[02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:10.660]   which has a lot to do with positive energy,
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:12.820]   not just positive thinking, but positive energy,
[02:55:12.820 --> 02:55:17.300]   but this triad of peace, contentment, and delight.
[02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:18.660]   And as you were explaining it,
[02:55:18.660 --> 02:55:21.420]   it's clear that it brings you great peace, contentment,
[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:23.320]   and delight as action terms,
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:25.940]   not like sit there and just hover in the basking in it.
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:29.180]   It's just so clear that this was a great idea.
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:32.720]   And I love that you started it as a way to kind of,
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:37.820]   I don't know, like knock the fear out of yourself
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:41.740]   a little bit by knocking a little fear into the whole thing.
[02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:43.740]   Like what would happen if you let your mind go
[02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:46.940]   and allowed yourself to explore this?
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:49.480]   - And what permission would it buy you
[02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:51.020]   if it's not a total disaster?
[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:52.420]   This is true for the four hour body too.
[02:55:52.420 --> 02:55:54.900]   I'm like, if this partially works,
[02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:57.660]   it's not even a home run, but let's say I get on base,
[02:55:57.660 --> 02:56:00.460]   what permission does this then buy me?
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:02.780]   What other "impossibles" and quotation marks
[02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:04.660]   am I willing to challenge?
[02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:08.080]   And I was able to make the hop from one category
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:10.600]   in the bookstore to a completely different category.
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:11.540]   And then the sky's the limit.
[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:12.860]   I was like, I can do anything.
[02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:13.680]   I can do whatever I want.
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:14.860]   I've given myself permission
[02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:16.100]   and the market has given me permission.
[02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:18.500]   But the most important first step
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:20.780]   is you giving yourself permission.
[02:56:20.780 --> 02:56:23.840]   And with say cockpunch, as ludicrous as it is,
[02:56:25.380 --> 02:56:27.900]   now that I've done that, my career hasn't ended,
[02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:31.100]   hasn't had any negative impact on my career whatsoever.
[02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:35.220]   I'm like, okay, that's actually kind of surprising.
[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:37.540]   - To the contrary, it seems like it gives you energy.
[02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:39.100]   It's raised money for science.
[02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:41.080]   Is it still raising money?
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:41.920]   - It's not.
[02:56:41.920 --> 02:56:45.100]   - Is there still an opportunity for people to contribute?
[02:56:45.100 --> 02:56:46.780]   - It's sold out.
[02:56:46.780 --> 02:56:48.980]   If people want to contribute to, say,
[02:56:48.980 --> 02:56:52.300]   the early stage science and let's just say
[02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:53.940]   specifically psychedelics, I would say
[02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:58.940]   it's very, very hard to get a very solid understanding
[02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:03.860]   of the field and the shifting sands
[02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:05.780]   and the projects and so on.
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.320]   It's very rapidly changing.
[02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:11.500]   So I would say just provide money to a foundation
[02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:12.620]   that's already doing good work.
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:14.120]   It could be River Styx Foundation.
[02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:16.460]   It could be Beckley Foundation.
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:17.980]   My foundation, Scise Foundation,
[02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:19.180]   I think does pretty good work.
[02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:22.820]   - And Scise is not just the journalism fellowships.
[02:57:22.820 --> 02:57:25.140]   They're also the, it's funding for psychedelics.
[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:26.700]   - Oh yeah, there's tons of stuff.
[02:57:26.700 --> 02:57:29.920]   There's a project page on scisefoundation.org.
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:30.880]   You can see the projects.
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:33.020]   There are probably 15 to 20 of them
[02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:35.140]   and they can see the basic science
[02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:37.360]   all the way from really basic science
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:40.320]   looking at possible mechanisms of action
[02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:43.380]   for something like DIPT, which is a very strange compound
[02:57:43.380 --> 02:57:46.020]   that most people aren't going to know it,
[02:57:46.020 --> 02:57:51.020]   that produces profound auditory distortions
[02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:55.880]   and hallucinations in humans, very hard to animal model.
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:59.360]   And from that all the way up
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:01.880]   to really sophisticated imaging studies,
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:05.460]   from that to say at least a year or two ago
[02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:09.200]   supporting phase three trials for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:11.120]   then the journalism, then the this, then the that,
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:14.460]   but a lot of different scientific studies
[02:58:14.460 --> 02:58:15.840]   that are being supported.
[02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:19.000]   So that's very exciting to me.
[02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:22.060]   But the cock punch side of things is all done.
[02:58:22.060 --> 02:58:23.900]   Money's been distributed
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:26.540]   and maybe I'll do more of this kind of thing,
[02:58:26.540 --> 02:58:28.380]   but I might take a different approach.
[02:58:28.380 --> 02:58:32.540]   I feel like, okay, I learned what I feel
[02:58:32.540 --> 02:58:34.300]   I wanted to learn from that
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:36.660]   and maybe I'll try something new next time.
[02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:38.640]   - One thing's clear.
[02:58:38.640 --> 02:58:42.320]   Nobody tells you what to do except you.
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:45.700]   But that's vetted through many important filters
[02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:50.520]   like structured filters and very thoughtful filters
[02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:51.640]   are the words that come to mind
[02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:53.420]   when I think about your process
[02:58:53.420 --> 02:58:54.260]   as you're sharing it with us.
[02:58:54.260 --> 02:58:55.100]   - And I'll add one more thing,
[02:58:55.100 --> 02:59:00.100]   which is one of the sources of joy of cock punch
[02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:04.400]   is that it is not over-planned.
[02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:08.520]   I set some initial conditions and now it's emergent.
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:12.820]   And as someone who has hyper-analyzed
[02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:17.820]   and meticulously planned most of my life for decades,
[02:59:17.820 --> 02:59:23.020]   I think it's helpful to have an improv component.
[02:59:23.020 --> 02:59:27.400]   So if you are a hyper-planner, if you're a hyper-measurer,
[02:59:27.400 --> 02:59:29.020]   if you like that degree of control,
[02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:29.900]   maybe you should try something
[02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:31.380]   that's a little less controlled.
[02:59:31.380 --> 02:59:34.520]   Take an improv class, try fiction writing,
[02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:36.420]   do something that isn't totally scripted
[02:59:36.420 --> 02:59:38.500]   where you don't know the outcome.
[02:59:38.500 --> 02:59:41.900]   I think it's really good medicine for people.
[02:59:41.900 --> 02:59:43.760]   Just like if you spend all your time in a yoga class,
[02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:46.780]   maybe you should spend one day a week lifting weights.
[02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:47.780]   See what that's like.
[02:59:47.780 --> 02:59:49.400]   And if you spend all your time in the gym
[02:59:49.400 --> 02:59:50.580]   and you can barely touch your toes,
[02:59:50.580 --> 02:59:53.020]   maybe you should do some more downward dog, try some yoga.
[02:59:53.020 --> 02:59:57.560]   Similar, I think the spectrum of hyper-planned
[02:59:57.560 --> 03:00:00.780]   to completely free-flowing and improv
[03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:06.780]   provides ample opportunity to enrich themselves
[03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:08.880]   and maybe address some weaknesses at the same time.
[03:00:08.880 --> 03:00:12.780]   So for me, "Cog Punch" has been incredibly therapeutic,
[03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:15.220]   probably the first time that anyone's ever uttered
[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:16.400]   that sentence, but yeah.
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:17.240]   - Probably.
[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:19.840]   But that's a part of what makes it so cool.
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:20.860]   - Yeah, totally.
[03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:21.700]   - I love it.
[03:00:21.700 --> 03:00:25.340]   I'm wondering if you'd be willing to share with us
[03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:30.340]   a little bit about your mindset, maybe even your motivation,
[03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:34.180]   but certainly your mindset around sharing
[03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:38.520]   some of the hard personal tribulations that you've shared.
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:42.260]   In preparation for this discussion today,
[03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:44.420]   I went back to some of those posts that you did
[03:00:44.420 --> 03:00:48.160]   and the podcasts that you did around this.
[03:00:48.160 --> 03:00:51.420]   And I'd listened to them at the time and, you know,
[03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:56.100]   they deal with quite serious violations of childhood
[03:00:56.100 --> 03:00:59.300]   and of self and they're hard.
[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:00.880]   I mean, they're hard to listen to
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.880]   and I can only imagine they must be even far, far harder
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:08.020]   to experience.
[03:01:08.020 --> 03:01:13.020]   And I was curious what led to your willingness to do that.
[03:01:13.020 --> 03:01:17.580]   And yeah, I mean, I have my own ideas
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:18.940]   about what might've motivated it,
[03:01:18.940 --> 03:01:21.200]   but I'd like to hear it from you.
[03:01:21.200 --> 03:01:22.140]   - Sure.
[03:01:22.140 --> 03:01:23.580]   Happy to talk about it.
[03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:25.940]   And I think there are two particular examples
[03:01:25.940 --> 03:01:27.180]   that come to mind.
[03:01:27.180 --> 03:01:31.960]   So one is my near suicide in college.
[03:01:31.960 --> 03:01:36.960]   And if people search some practical thoughts on suicide
[03:01:37.580 --> 03:01:38.900]   and my name, it'll pop right up.
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:42.380]   I mean, if you just search my name and suicide,
[03:01:42.380 --> 03:01:44.340]   it'll probably pop right up.
[03:01:44.340 --> 03:01:47.380]   Pretty well indexed at this point, which is very deliberate.
[03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:49.980]   People can look at the URL structure
[03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:53.260]   for a little wink and a hat tip.
[03:01:53.260 --> 03:01:57.440]   It'll tell you something about optimizing for Google.
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:01:59.320]   If you look at it, I'll just tell you.
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:02.180]   The URL, it spells out how to commit suicide,
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:04.580]   but clearly I'm not teaching people how to commit suicide,
[03:02:04.580 --> 03:02:08.940]   but I wanted that to be a honeypot for some of that traffic
[03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:11.340]   because it's a lot easier now to find
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:14.940]   that type of practical implementation advice.
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:16.340]   And it's a bit harder to find,
[03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:18.600]   I think, compelling intervention.
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:21.660]   So first of all, if you're feeling suicide,
[03:02:21.660 --> 03:02:24.700]   obviously call Suicide Hotline, please, right?
[03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:28.040]   That's sometimes the last thing that people want to hear
[03:02:28.040 --> 03:02:31.700]   when they are in a place of suicidal ideation.
[03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:36.060]   And the reason I ended up writing a long post about this,
[03:02:36.060 --> 03:02:37.200]   which was terrifying to write
[03:02:37.200 --> 03:02:41.440]   because I had never told my parents,
[03:02:41.440 --> 03:02:43.600]   I had never told my closest friends.
[03:02:43.600 --> 03:02:44.540]   This was a secret.
[03:02:44.540 --> 03:02:47.160]   It was a dark, dark secret.
[03:02:47.160 --> 03:02:52.160]   And I wrote about it because I went to an event
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:55.860]   in San Francisco.
[03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:58.300]   I was interviewed on stage by Jason Kalkanis,
[03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.580]   who's a friend and a very good interviewer.
[03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:06.580]   At an event and after I got off stage,
[03:03:06.580 --> 03:03:09.020]   a bunch of people approached me and I was saying hi
[03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:11.260]   and taking photos and signing things and so on.
[03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:17.540]   And there was one young man there, very well dressed,
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:18.940]   which isn't really relevant.
[03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:20.820]   It was striking 'cause in San Francisco,
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:23.260]   sometimes people are very underdressed
[03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:24.500]   and he had dressed up for it.
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:27.340]   Like he'd taken it seriously and he was in a suit and tie.
[03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:32.180]   And he asked me if I could sign a book for his brother.
[03:03:32.180 --> 03:03:35.500]   And I said, "Sure, no problem."
[03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:36.340]   And I asked him,
[03:03:36.340 --> 03:03:37.940]   "What would you like me to write to your brother?"
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:39.700]   And he kind of blanked.
[03:03:39.700 --> 03:03:41.340]   He didn't kind of blank, he totally blanked.
[03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:45.480]   But the look behind his eyes was unusual.
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:48.980]   It wasn't just, I don't know what to say blank.
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:50.460]   There was something else behind it.
[03:03:50.460 --> 03:03:52.660]   And I could tell that he felt under pressure.
[03:03:52.660 --> 03:03:55.600]   And I said, "No problem, take your time.
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:56.440]   I'll tell you what,
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.780]   I'll chat with a couple of other people
[03:03:57.780 --> 03:03:59.060]   and I'll sign the book.
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:01.620]   No problem, I'm not going anywhere."
[03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:03.620]   And chatted with the other folks.
[03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:07.440]   And then he asked if he could just walk me to the elevator
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:08.360]   and then I could sign the book.
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:09.880]   I was like, "Sure."
[03:04:09.880 --> 03:04:14.760]   And he explained to me as I walked to the elevator
[03:04:14.760 --> 03:04:19.500]   how his brother had been a huge fan of mine.
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:24.280]   And that I'd really kept his brother afloat for a long time
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:26.660]   and eventually his brother killed himself.
[03:04:26.660 --> 03:04:30.960]   And that they kept his room exactly how it was.
[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:33.300]   And he wanted me to sign the book
[03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:35.700]   so that he could put the book in his brother's room.
[03:04:35.700 --> 03:04:42.280]   And he asked me if I'd ever considered
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:44.780]   talking about mental health
[03:04:44.780 --> 03:04:46.980]   and mental health challenges publicly,
[03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:49.900]   because he thought it would really help a lot of people.
[03:04:49.900 --> 03:04:51.580]   And that just,
[03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:54.320]   I mean, I'm like feeling myself tear up right now.
[03:04:54.320 --> 03:04:57.780]   I mean, it was so crushing to hear the story.
[03:04:57.780 --> 03:05:01.060]   And totally unbeknownst to him,
[03:05:01.060 --> 03:05:05.660]   I had a lot of history with depressive episodes.
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:07.160]   And when I say near suicide,
[03:05:07.160 --> 03:05:08.420]   I had it on the calendar.
[03:05:08.420 --> 03:05:09.280]   I had a plan.
[03:05:09.280 --> 03:05:10.180]   I was gonna kill myself.
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:11.460]   I knew exactly how I was gonna do it.
[03:05:11.460 --> 03:05:12.540]   I knew where I was gonna do it.
[03:05:12.540 --> 03:05:16.760]   I knew all of the variables that I needed to account for
[03:05:16.760 --> 03:05:17.600]   to get it done.
[03:05:17.600 --> 03:05:21.420]   And the only reason that didn't happen
[03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:22.820]   for people that don't have the context,
[03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:24.460]   which most people won't,
[03:05:24.460 --> 03:05:28.420]   is I had tried to reserve a book at Firestone Library.
[03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:30.460]   This is at Princeton,
[03:05:30.460 --> 03:05:32.040]   which had something to do with suicide.
[03:05:32.040 --> 03:05:33.660]   It was like assisted suicide,
[03:05:33.660 --> 03:05:35.940]   like the Clinician's Guide to Euthanasia,
[03:05:35.940 --> 03:05:37.540]   something like that.
[03:05:37.540 --> 03:05:39.660]   And it wasn't in.
[03:05:39.660 --> 03:05:42.980]   And I had forgotten to change my address
[03:05:42.980 --> 03:05:44.180]   of the registrar's office.
[03:05:44.180 --> 03:05:46.060]   I was taking a year away from school.
[03:05:46.060 --> 03:05:49.500]   And that was to focus on finishing my thesis.
[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:51.060]   It was to try a few jobs,
[03:05:51.060 --> 03:05:53.580]   but I'd ended up in a very bad place
[03:05:53.580 --> 03:05:55.220]   and was feeling very isolated.
[03:05:55.220 --> 03:05:57.260]   And my friends were graduating a year ahead of me,
[03:05:57.260 --> 03:05:58.860]   and I was stuck on this thesis.
[03:05:58.860 --> 03:06:00.020]   And there's a lot of backstory
[03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:02.060]   that I won't bore people with,
[03:06:02.060 --> 03:06:06.700]   but it got to the point where I decided,
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:09.540]   not that objectively my life is bad.
[03:06:09.540 --> 03:06:10.380]   I think this is where people
[03:06:10.380 --> 03:06:13.740]   who haven't experienced depression get a little confused,
[03:06:13.740 --> 03:06:15.440]   or it's hard for them to identify
[03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:17.880]   when they give advice to a depressed person.
[03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:19.500]   Because you might say to a depressed person,
[03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.940]   but look, your life is so great.
[03:06:20.940 --> 03:06:23.260]   Like, there's this, there's that, there's this.
[03:06:23.260 --> 03:06:25.020]   And for a lot of depressed people to say,
[03:06:25.020 --> 03:06:27.420]   yeah, I know, I look at that,
[03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:30.540]   and I can't fix my state because I am broken.
[03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:33.380]   And if this is how I'm gonna have to live forever
[03:06:33.380 --> 03:06:36.460]   with being this broken and dysfunctional
[03:06:36.460 --> 03:06:40.540]   and to have this internal hell that I live day by day,
[03:06:40.540 --> 03:06:43.740]   I just want to escape.
[03:06:43.740 --> 03:06:46.780]   It's like someone jumping out of a burning building.
[03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:47.960]   It's like they don't wanna kill themselves,
[03:06:47.960 --> 03:06:50.020]   but they're jumping out of a burning building.
[03:06:50.020 --> 03:06:54.880]   And so I had it on the calendar,
[03:06:54.880 --> 03:06:56.180]   and thank God this was back
[03:06:56.180 --> 03:06:58.600]   when they would still send you a physical reminder
[03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:02.180]   in the mail, a little postcard that says your book is in.
[03:07:02.180 --> 03:07:05.480]   And that card went to my parents' house,
[03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:08.980]   and my mom saw it and panicked and called me.
[03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:09.880]   And I lied.
[03:07:09.880 --> 03:07:11.520]   I said it was for a friend who went to Rutgers
[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:12.880]   who was doing a project on A, B, and C,
[03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:16.540]   but it was just enough to kind of snap me out of the trance
[03:07:16.540 --> 03:07:19.820]   and realize that killing yourself
[03:07:19.820 --> 03:07:22.760]   is like putting on a suicide vest with explosives
[03:07:22.760 --> 03:07:24.440]   and walking into a room of all the people
[03:07:24.440 --> 03:07:27.600]   you care the most about and blowing yourself up.
[03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:31.300]   So that snapped me out of it, but no one knew this.
[03:07:31.300 --> 03:07:33.700]   This guy certainly didn't know that.
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:38.240]   And that is when I went home and thought about it
[03:07:38.240 --> 03:07:43.240]   and just decided, okay, there's a chance if I write this,
[03:07:43.240 --> 03:07:45.920]   it's not certain, but there's a chance
[03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:47.480]   that this might help someone.
[03:07:47.480 --> 03:07:49.960]   It might prevent someone from doing
[03:07:49.960 --> 03:07:51.460]   what I was almost about to do.
[03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:56.960]   And so I spent months getting this post written
[03:07:56.960 --> 03:07:59.400]   and put it out, and I know for a fact
[03:07:59.400 --> 03:08:02.400]   that it has saved minimum dozens of lives.
[03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:03.780]   And there are other things,
[03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:08.780]   including a very extensive list of resources.
[03:08:08.780 --> 03:08:15.440]   And so that gave me, I suppose,
[03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:18.960]   not a toe in the water, but sort of jumping feet first
[03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:22.160]   into the deep end and experience of being that vulnerable.
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:23.320]   And this was a long time ago.
[03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:27.040]   I mean, this is, I want to say at least eight to 10 years ago
[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:28.840]   when I put that post out.
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:33.840]   And then I want to say it was just before COVID lockdown.
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:42.680]   I was in Costa Rica visiting a friend.
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:44.400]   I was with my girlfriend at the time,
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:47.440]   and she knew a secret of mine.
[03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:50.880]   And she was one of maybe two or three people who knew
[03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:53.540]   that I'd been sexually abused when I was a kid
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:56.380]   by a babysitter's son from two to four, roughly,
[03:08:56.380 --> 03:09:01.680]   and routinely all the time kind of thing.
[03:09:01.680 --> 03:09:06.680]   And what you're envisioning is what happens.
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:08.680]   So it was not good.
[03:09:08.680 --> 03:09:12.160]   And that had been compartmentalized and locked away
[03:09:12.160 --> 03:09:14.780]   for my whole life.
[03:09:14.780 --> 03:09:16.960]   I was like, that's in the past.
[03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:18.980]   We're focused on moving forward.
[03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:24.300]   And nothing to be fixed, nothing to fix.
[03:09:24.300 --> 03:09:26.540]   And that was my perspective on things.
[03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:33.320]   It turned out, it wasn't quite that simple.
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:37.520]   And so I had done a lot of work, a lot of therapy,
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:39.660]   used psychedelic therapies as well,
[03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:44.080]   which once again are not all upside potential.
[03:09:44.080 --> 03:09:46.140]   There are some significant risks.
[03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:49.180]   But I had come a long way.
[03:09:49.180 --> 03:09:53.120]   And my plan had always been to wait until my parents passed
[03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:55.920]   'cause I didn't want them to blame themselves for this,
[03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:58.720]   and then to write a book.
[03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:02.360]   And there was something though at the time
[03:10:02.360 --> 03:10:04.580]   when I was having dinner with my girlfriend
[03:10:04.580 --> 03:10:07.640]   that was dissatisfying about that plan.
[03:10:07.640 --> 03:10:08.960]   There's something about it that bothered me,
[03:10:08.960 --> 03:10:10.340]   and I couldn't quite put a finger on it.
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:12.320]   And I was talking to her about it.
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:15.520]   And she said, "That's gonna take a long time."
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:18.880]   She's like, "Have you ever thought about how many people
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:23.880]   are going to pass away or die or suffer between now
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:26.720]   and when you publish that book?"
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:31.920]   And I thought about it.
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:34.800]   And it was at that dinner that I decided
[03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:39.440]   to at least record a podcast covering this terrain.
[03:10:39.440 --> 03:10:42.960]   I was not at all convinced that I wanted to publish it.
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:45.600]   I was terrified of publishing it.
[03:10:45.600 --> 03:10:48.440]   Also because it meant opening myself up
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:50.380]   to a lot of conversations
[03:10:50.380 --> 03:10:56.760]   or maybe just hurtful commentary online.
[03:10:56.760 --> 03:10:57.600]   Who knows?
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:10:59.020]   Like people are, there are a lot of idiots out there
[03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:01.040]   and a lot of otherwise fine people
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:03.000]   who are idiots on the internet.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:04.600]   So I was very hesitant.
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:08.960]   Ultimately decided I didn't wanna do it as a one-man show.
[03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:11.760]   I didn't want to make it a monologue.
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:14.900]   So I asked my friend, Debbie Millman,
[03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:17.080]   who had been on my podcast,
[03:11:17.080 --> 03:11:19.320]   she's an amazing graphic designer and teacher,
[03:11:19.320 --> 03:11:22.480]   but she had unexpectedly on my podcast
[03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:24.040]   based on some of my questions,
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:27.240]   for the first time publicly told her story
[03:11:27.240 --> 03:11:29.380]   about being sexually abused.
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:34.380]   And so I had leaned on her in years after that in private.
[03:11:34.380 --> 03:11:36.960]   And I asked her if she'd be willing
[03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:39.760]   to have a conversation with me about our
[03:11:39.760 --> 03:11:44.560]   respective journeys and what it felt like,
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:47.000]   what it looked like, what helped, what didn't help,
[03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.820]   what worked, what didn't, to provide at the very least
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:54.320]   a glimmer of hope for people who were keeping
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:56.800]   some of these dark secrets or contending with them,
[03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:59.260]   not knowing what to do with them.
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:01.980]   And we had that conversation and I sat on it,
[03:12:01.980 --> 03:12:05.840]   I sat on it, I sat on it, and then I put it out.
[03:12:05.840 --> 03:12:10.840]   And decided in advance that I would not look
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.000]   at any social media for at least several weeks afterwards.
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.440]   If my team saw anything on social media or got emails,
[03:12:17.440 --> 03:12:20.280]   I didn't want to see anything other than positive feedback,
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:22.240]   which is not my de facto.
[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:27.240]   I'm usually eager to solicit constructive feedback,
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:31.500]   but in this case, I knew that my own position
[03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:33.760]   was too vulnerable.
[03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:38.760]   I didn't want to open up the possibility
[03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:41.420]   of destabilizing myself.
[03:12:41.420 --> 03:12:47.660]   And I put it out, and I think it's the most important
[03:12:47.660 --> 03:12:49.040]   podcast I've ever put out.
[03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:51.400]   So I kind of felt like my job was done
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:55.080]   from a podcasting perspective after that.
[03:12:55.080 --> 03:13:00.080]   And it's been incredibly gratifying.
[03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:04.580]   I think it has certainly helped a fair number of people.
[03:13:04.580 --> 03:13:05.840]   And it was also really hard,
[03:13:05.840 --> 03:13:08.840]   because what I didn't anticipate was I would say
[03:13:08.840 --> 03:13:13.840]   of my really super high performing close male friends,
[03:13:13.840 --> 03:13:24.220]   maybe half reached out to me to tell someone
[03:13:24.220 --> 03:13:27.700]   for the first time about their extremely awful,
[03:13:27.700 --> 03:13:31.240]   graphic first-hand experience of being sexually abused.
[03:13:31.240 --> 03:13:34.360]   The percentages were mind-blowing.
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:38.240]   The actual percentages were super, super, super high,
[03:13:38.240 --> 03:13:40.640]   which is part of the reason I mentioned earlier.
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:43.260]   I think it's good to spend a little bit of time
[03:13:43.260 --> 03:13:45.600]   in those empty spaces to see,
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:50.600]   am I in a positive energetic sense pursuing something good,
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:54.280]   or am I running away from demons whipping my back?
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:57.820]   And for a lot of those guys,
[03:13:57.820 --> 03:13:59.560]   I'm sure it's true for a lot of women too,
[03:13:59.560 --> 03:14:04.560]   like they find medication through intense focus
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:12.720]   and achievement, which is super adaptive in a lot of ways.
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:17.180]   But it doesn't always have lifetime reliability.
[03:14:17.180 --> 03:14:21.040]   And that's the story.
[03:14:22.980 --> 03:14:25.560]   It's impossible to hear those stories,
[03:14:25.560 --> 03:14:29.820]   your story without feeling some substantial emotion.
[03:14:29.820 --> 03:14:31.140]   I'm not trying to intellectualize.
[03:14:31.140 --> 03:14:36.140]   It's both of those aspects of your history
[03:14:36.140 --> 03:14:39.480]   that you shared are huge, right?
[03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:40.300]   They really are.
[03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:41.740]   They're obviously huge for you.
[03:14:41.740 --> 03:14:44.780]   And they're huge in terms of the positive impact
[03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:45.620]   in the world.
[03:14:45.620 --> 03:14:50.140]   I know this because I have read the comments, right?
[03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:54.640]   And I've talked to people who have listened
[03:14:54.640 --> 03:14:57.160]   to those podcasts and read those blogs
[03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:01.900]   and have similar or maybe different stories of trauma.
[03:15:01.900 --> 03:15:05.220]   But I think as with your work in the psychedelic space,
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:09.360]   as with your work in the physical augmentation space,
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:10.860]   whatever you want to call it,
[03:15:10.860 --> 03:15:15.480]   it's apparent that you're willing to be first man in
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:16.320]   on a lot of things.
[03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:19.080]   And really you're sitting alone there in those moments.
[03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:23.200]   And these categories of revealing trauma are,
[03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:26.340]   in my mind anyway, so much more substantial
[03:15:26.340 --> 03:15:29.260]   in terms of their impact, positive impact.
[03:15:29.260 --> 03:15:32.800]   And the other aspects for our body and psychedelic work,
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:35.120]   et cetera, is also tremendously impactful.
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:36.120]   So that's saying a lot.
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:39.760]   So I just want to say thank you for your bravery.
[03:15:39.760 --> 03:15:41.280]   And- - Thanks, Andrew.
[03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:45.840]   - Yeah, it's crazy 'cause I think that a lot of people
[03:15:47.660 --> 03:15:49.660]   can imagine telling a story
[03:15:49.660 --> 03:15:51.040]   or to a close friend or something,
[03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:54.800]   but to put it out into the world, it's huge.
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:15:57.300]   You don't know how that's going to ripple.
[03:15:57.300 --> 03:16:01.120]   And you've been a real pioneer and example for me,
[03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:04.340]   for Lex, for other people in revealing things,
[03:16:04.340 --> 03:16:06.200]   not like that, but different.
[03:16:06.200 --> 03:16:08.860]   And Peter Attia has recently been opening up
[03:16:08.860 --> 03:16:11.200]   about some serious challenges that he's had
[03:16:11.200 --> 03:16:12.680]   in his book.
[03:16:12.680 --> 03:16:14.320]   He does that on podcasts, he's been doing it.
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:19.320]   So yet another category, arguably the most important category
[03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:25.140]   for exploration and sharing and thoughtful bravery,
[03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:27.500]   'cause he didn't just put it out there in any form.
[03:16:27.500 --> 03:16:30.120]   So one thing I do know by experience
[03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:33.040]   is there's nothing weirder than being told thank you
[03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:34.480]   for the painful thing that you did.
[03:16:34.480 --> 03:16:36.120]   So I don't want to push that too far,
[03:16:36.120 --> 03:16:37.400]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:39.220]   because it really has its impact.
[03:16:39.220 --> 03:16:40.860]   And for doing it again here today,
[03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:44.780]   because, so yeah, huge thanks for doing that.
[03:16:44.780 --> 03:16:46.040]   - Yeah, my pleasure.
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:48.580]   And I'll also say, I got advice
[03:16:48.580 --> 03:16:53.580]   from a very, very experienced psychedelic facilitator
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:56.800]   at one point who said,
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.100]   "Take the pain and make it part of your medicine."
[03:17:01.100 --> 03:17:04.500]   And the way I think that applies here
[03:17:04.500 --> 03:17:09.440]   is we all experience pain.
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:11.760]   We all experience suffering.
[03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:15.020]   Many of us have experienced trauma of one type or another,
[03:17:15.020 --> 03:17:18.960]   and that can consume you.
[03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:22.200]   I mean, it can consume you, but it's like fire, right?
[03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:24.640]   It can consume you, but you can also harness it
[03:17:24.640 --> 03:17:26.900]   and use it for different things.
[03:17:26.900 --> 03:17:31.820]   And I know for, I think it's, I'm not gonna hedge.
[03:17:31.820 --> 03:17:34.160]   I'll say, I know for a fact that there are people
[03:17:34.160 --> 03:17:37.160]   I've spoken to who are suicidal,
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:40.800]   and by the way, I'm not inviting everyone who's listening,
[03:17:40.800 --> 03:17:43.520]   if you are suicidal, to reach out to because it won't work.
[03:17:43.520 --> 03:17:46.160]   I've had to disengage from that because it gets too heavy,
[03:17:46.160 --> 03:17:48.260]   just to engage one-on-one with people who are suicidal.
[03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:50.980]   But there are resources in that post I mentioned,
[03:17:50.980 --> 03:17:52.680]   the practical thoughts on suicide.
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:57.600]   But let's just talk about closer friends,
[03:17:57.600 --> 03:18:00.360]   people you would never suspect in a million years
[03:18:00.360 --> 03:18:03.140]   who are this close to blowing their brains out,
[03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:07.720]   people folks would recognize in some cases.
[03:18:07.720 --> 03:18:13.600]   The fact that I was also there once is why they listen to me
[03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:17.560]   'cause I have, unfortunately, I'm a subject matter expert,
[03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:22.560]   and I have credibility, and that actually is very redeeming.
[03:18:22.560 --> 03:18:24.940]   It provides some meaning to the suffering
[03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:25.780]   that I experienced.
[03:18:25.780 --> 03:18:30.720]   It's like, okay, here I am, for whatever host of reasons,
[03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:34.000]   I am put in this place in time with this person,
[03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:37.160]   and they don't trust the input
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:38.800]   of these other people they're talking to
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:41.800]   because those people don't know what it's like.
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:44.280]   But I can look at this person in the eye and be like,
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:48.240]   oh, I know, and that's just a different thing.
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:53.240]   So you can find a way to transmute that pain
[03:18:53.240 --> 03:18:57.260]   into something meaningful,
[03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:00.740]   into a gift that hopefully you can share in some way.
[03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:06.400]   Not necessarily with the whole wide world, just one person.
[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:07.400]   That's a big deal.
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:09.100]   One person's a big deal.
[03:19:09.100 --> 03:19:11.040]   There's a lot out there that is intended
[03:19:11.040 --> 03:19:13.320]   for mass consumption that gets in front of millions of people
[03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:15.920]   doesn't really impact a single person very much.
[03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:19.120]   So even if you don't have podcasts, you don't have books,
[03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:21.480]   if you have the ability to sit down with one person
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:22.400]   and really make an impact,
[03:19:22.400 --> 03:19:25.240]   that's actually more meaningful than most of the crap
[03:19:25.240 --> 03:19:26.880]   that gets put out there.
[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:28.460]   So take heart.
[03:19:28.460 --> 03:19:30.460]   - Amen to that.
[03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:35.320]   I'd like to spend a little bit of time talking about
[03:19:35.320 --> 03:19:38.120]   the roles you see yourself in.
[03:19:38.120 --> 03:19:40.520]   I had this list coming in here of, okay,
[03:19:40.520 --> 03:19:43.680]   you've done the exploration of the health sphere,
[03:19:43.680 --> 03:19:47.580]   self-experimentation, you've been an investor,
[03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:52.920]   you are an investor, you're a podcaster.
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:56.300]   I think these are more than titles.
[03:19:56.300 --> 03:19:59.760]   I think titles are great,
[03:19:59.760 --> 03:20:02.320]   but titles are what we get from other people
[03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:04.520]   telling us what we do or deciding what we do.
[03:20:04.520 --> 03:20:10.320]   I'm more interested in how you think about yourself,
[03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:12.920]   like your own role identity.
[03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:15.000]   And I have to assume you've spent
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:15.920]   a little bit of time on this.
[03:20:15.920 --> 03:20:17.040]   Like if one were to go through
[03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:21.780]   the checklist of possible roles, okay, I confess I do this.
[03:20:21.780 --> 03:20:25.680]   I think I check the box of animal
[03:20:25.680 --> 03:20:28.440]   because we're animals after all, and we're humans.
[03:20:28.440 --> 03:20:29.280]   - You're still pole dancing?
[03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:30.600]   I think you're just a pole dancer.
[03:20:30.600 --> 03:20:33.920]   - Absolutely not. [laughing]
[03:20:33.920 --> 03:20:35.860]   - Are you still tango dancing?
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:37.960]   - I'm planning on getting back into it.
[03:20:37.960 --> 03:20:38.800]   - Great.
[03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:40.040]   - That does have some background.
[03:20:40.040 --> 03:20:42.000]   - I have Argentine lineage and I'm embarrassed to say
[03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.320]   I don't know tango, but-
[03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:48.320]   - You got the mate in the green room, so you're set.
[03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:52.680]   - My grandparents tango into their eighties, I think.
[03:20:52.680 --> 03:20:54.040]   - Good for them. - Late eighties, yeah.
[03:20:54.040 --> 03:20:55.000]   - Good for them. - Late eighties, yeah.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:56.560]   Ate steak and smoke cigarettes
[03:20:56.560 --> 03:20:58.960]   and lived until their nineties.
[03:20:58.960 --> 03:21:00.920]   My time died a champion. - Exactly.
[03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:05.560]   But I'm curious about the roles that you see yourself in.
[03:21:05.560 --> 03:21:09.440]   Like role identity to me is so important
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:12.240]   in terms of where we see ourselves now
[03:21:12.240 --> 03:21:14.320]   and where we see ourselves going forward.
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:17.120]   And who knows, maybe you don't have any role identity plan,
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:20.240]   but what are some boxes that you see yourself in now
[03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:23.120]   that you really strongly identify with?
[03:21:23.120 --> 03:21:24.460]   And then what are some boxes
[03:21:24.460 --> 03:21:27.320]   that you'd like to check off going forward?
[03:21:28.480 --> 03:21:33.060]   - So current boxes, I would say the two
[03:21:33.060 --> 03:21:37.660]   that I probably identify with most, maybe three,
[03:21:37.660 --> 03:21:40.560]   but I'll focus on two.
[03:21:40.560 --> 03:21:43.640]   Experimentalist, which can take a lot of forms.
[03:21:43.640 --> 03:21:49.040]   That can apply to a whole lot of different spheres.
[03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:52.840]   So experimentalist and then teacher.
[03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:57.080]   And for the longest time, long, long time,
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:21:59.400]   I thought eventually I would go back
[03:21:59.400 --> 03:22:01.040]   and actually be a ninth grade teacher
[03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:03.800]   because I feel like that is such a critical window
[03:22:03.800 --> 03:22:07.860]   for so many kids where they can either
[03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:10.100]   hit an inflection point and go in a really good direction,
[03:22:10.100 --> 03:22:12.300]   or they can go in a really bad direction.
[03:22:12.300 --> 03:22:14.480]   And I certainly saw that on Long Island
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:16.800]   with a lot of my friends, a lot of overdoses,
[03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:20.660]   a bunch of friends who have died of opiate addiction
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:21.500]   and various things.
[03:22:21.500 --> 03:22:24.600]   And I had some intervention with mentors early on
[03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:28.760]   that sort of flipped the switch on the railroad track
[03:22:28.760 --> 03:22:29.920]   and sent me in a different direction.
[03:22:29.920 --> 03:22:32.480]   So I thought for a long time I would go back
[03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:34.080]   and be a ninth grade teacher.
[03:22:34.080 --> 03:22:38.640]   And my impulse to experiment leads to enthusiasm
[03:22:38.640 --> 03:22:40.960]   for teaching, if that makes any sense.
[03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:45.560]   Because I feel like as good as I might be
[03:22:45.560 --> 03:22:49.240]   or decent at taking a complex subject,
[03:22:49.240 --> 03:22:52.280]   deconstructing it, applying 80/20,
[03:22:52.280 --> 03:22:57.000]   putting things in order, and learning things very quickly,
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:23:01.240]   which includes stress testing assumptions
[03:23:01.240 --> 03:23:06.160]   in that sort of assumed progression for skill,
[03:23:06.160 --> 03:23:07.000]   like language learning.
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.800]   There's so many myths in language learning, as an example.
[03:23:09.800 --> 03:23:14.220]   If it takes me, say, six months
[03:23:14.220 --> 03:23:18.520]   to become reasonably competent in field X,
[03:23:18.520 --> 03:23:20.360]   I can usually get other people
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:24.040]   to that same point of competence in a third of that time.
[03:23:24.040 --> 03:23:26.600]   So for me, it's very gratifying to teach.
[03:23:26.600 --> 03:23:30.200]   And I view all the books as teaching tools.
[03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:31.280]   I'm no Tolstoy.
[03:23:31.280 --> 03:23:33.540]   I recognize I'm not the world's greatest writer.
[03:23:33.540 --> 03:23:35.580]   I take the writing seriously.
[03:23:35.580 --> 03:23:37.160]   I don't half-ass it.
[03:23:37.160 --> 03:23:39.920]   I do many, many, many revisions, even for Cockpunch.
[03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:44.540]   It's like 27 revisions for a short story called Cockpunch.
[03:23:44.540 --> 03:23:46.600]   So I take it seriously, but I recognize
[03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:50.800]   that I'm not the world's greatest wordsmith,
[03:23:50.800 --> 03:23:57.960]   but I am looking for outcomes in readers or listeners,
[03:23:57.960 --> 03:24:01.280]   and I view my job as that of teacher.
[03:24:01.280 --> 03:24:04.320]   So I'd say experimentalist and teacher are the two.
[03:24:04.320 --> 03:24:08.440]   And those both go a long way,
[03:24:08.440 --> 03:24:13.120]   and applies to, say, dog training.
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:16.240]   Ran lots of experiments.
[03:24:16.240 --> 03:24:18.480]   For those listening, Tim just looked under the table.
[03:24:18.480 --> 03:24:20.140]   One thing I should have said at the beginning,
[03:24:20.140 --> 03:24:24.040]   and I did not, is that this is the first
[03:24:24.040 --> 03:24:26.760]   Huberman Lab podcast to feature a guest
[03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:27.920]   who brought their dog.
[03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:30.020]   So we have Molly is here as well,
[03:24:30.020 --> 03:24:32.680]   and we're absolutely delighted.
[03:24:32.680 --> 03:24:36.480]   There has not been a dog at on the Huberman Lab podcast
[03:24:36.480 --> 03:24:38.260]   since Costello passed away.
[03:24:38.260 --> 03:24:43.260]   And I'm practically floating in delight
[03:24:43.260 --> 03:24:44.900]   that Molly's here today.
[03:24:44.900 --> 03:24:45.740]   She's amazing.
[03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:47.700]   - You've done an amazing job training her, too.
[03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:48.540]   - Thank you, yeah.
[03:24:48.540 --> 03:24:50.280]   She's laying right next to my feet,
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:52.160]   licking my hand as I speak.
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:24:53.000]   - So good.
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.540]   - And I'd say if I were to expand that by one,
[03:24:55.540 --> 03:24:57.860]   I would probably say explorer,
[03:24:57.860 --> 03:25:01.600]   but the exploring goes hand in hand with the experimentation.
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:06.480]   So that could be geographic exploration.
[03:25:06.480 --> 03:25:08.600]   It could be spending time with people
[03:25:08.600 --> 03:25:13.600]   who are excellent at anything in any field,
[03:25:15.080 --> 03:25:19.200]   and seeing where that gingerbread trail leads me.
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:22.840]   And I think the exploration and the experimentation
[03:25:22.840 --> 03:25:26.400]   are, for me, bedfellows.
[03:25:26.400 --> 03:25:27.240]   They go together.
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:32.340]   - What about roles that you would like to explore
[03:25:32.340 --> 03:25:34.080]   or potentially see yourself in?
[03:25:34.080 --> 03:25:35.520]   I mean, I don't have a magic wand,
[03:25:35.520 --> 03:25:37.760]   but if I did as a fellow podcaster
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:40.660]   and I consider you a friend, I would say,
[03:25:40.660 --> 03:25:44.920]   okay, if I could wand you to the success in a given role.
[03:25:44.920 --> 03:25:46.240]   That wouldn't be the way it would work,
[03:25:46.240 --> 03:25:47.440]   and that wouldn't be as gratifying
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:49.100]   as having to figure it all out,
[03:25:49.100 --> 03:25:52.880]   'cause that's part of your machinery, as you just told us.
[03:25:52.880 --> 03:25:55.080]   So yeah, what are some life roles
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:57.680]   that you're interested in expanding
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:25:59.640]   or stepping into that you haven't explored?
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:03.480]   - Yeah, I'd say more artists, more artistry,
[03:26:03.480 --> 03:26:06.900]   especially in the visual sense,
[03:26:06.900 --> 03:26:09.480]   because I wanted to be a comic book penciler
[03:26:09.480 --> 03:26:12.760]   for a really long time, got paid as an illustrator
[03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:14.960]   towards the end of high school and during college,
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:17.220]   so they illustrated books and magazines and so on.
[03:26:17.220 --> 03:26:18.080]   Then I just dropped it. - I didn't know that.
[03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:20.000]   - I dropped it when I graduated because that was kid stuff
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:21.440]   and it was time to get serious and be an adult,
[03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:23.640]   and I just, cold turkey, just stopped all of it.
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:25.600]   And so the skills have atrophied a lot,
[03:26:25.600 --> 03:26:28.920]   but there's still a bit in there.
[03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:32.120]   - I've seen some posts on Instagram that were quite good.
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:34.200]   - So I'm still messing around, I'm still messing around,
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:36.720]   and especially when I have some structure, I do well,
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:38.800]   so I'd like to pursue that.
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:43.720]   I would like to experiment with animation.
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:46.160]   So I don't know if animator would be the right label
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:48.680]   because I'd most likely not be doing the animation myself,
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:53.540]   but playing a role in visual art would be one.
[03:26:53.540 --> 03:26:57.320]   Father would be another one, eventually.
[03:26:57.320 --> 03:27:00.000]   And try not to be attached to it,
[03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:04.080]   but we all play games of various types,
[03:27:04.080 --> 03:27:06.200]   and if we get really good at certain games
[03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:08.540]   that are socially rewarded, then you make money
[03:27:08.540 --> 03:27:13.400]   doing a podcast, or investing, or whatever it might be.
[03:27:13.400 --> 03:27:18.400]   But when my, when the sort of ramp of my learning
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:21.480]   starts to flatten out a bit,
[03:27:21.480 --> 03:27:23.780]   I tend to get bored of those games,
[03:27:23.780 --> 03:27:28.780]   and I think that certainly one of the biggest adventures
[03:27:28.780 --> 03:27:32.620]   must be parenthood.
[03:27:32.620 --> 03:27:37.620]   So at some point, I think Father would be on there.
[03:27:38.300 --> 03:27:40.440]   And I should say, this is very judgmental of me to say,
[03:27:40.440 --> 03:27:41.480]   but I think there's a big difference
[03:27:41.480 --> 03:27:46.480]   between wanting to be a parent and wanting to have kids.
[03:27:46.480 --> 03:27:49.880]   I'm very cautious about saying I wanna have kids,
[03:27:49.880 --> 03:27:51.440]   because it doesn't automatically imply
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:53.520]   you wanna be a good parent,
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:56.000]   which is also why I thought it was very important
[03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:00.320]   for me to spend a lot of time training Molly, and--
[03:28:00.320 --> 03:28:01.520]   - A lot of learning there, right?
[03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:02.840]   - Yeah, it just seems like, all right,
[03:28:02.840 --> 03:28:05.280]   am I gonna do the heavy lifting and the hard work?
[03:28:06.400 --> 03:28:10.000]   Recognizing that kids are not deferred dogs,
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:14.160]   but I do think there are actually a lot of similarities
[03:28:14.160 --> 03:28:16.980]   in terms of just predictive ability.
[03:28:16.980 --> 03:28:20.260]   If you see someone who has dogs that are terribly trained,
[03:28:20.260 --> 03:28:22.420]   look at their kids.
[03:28:22.420 --> 03:28:23.340]   [laughing]
[03:28:23.340 --> 03:28:24.420]   You might see some similarities.
[03:28:24.420 --> 03:28:27.820]   - My good friend, my good friend, I'll out him here,
[03:28:27.820 --> 03:28:29.440]   who's a MD, PhD, is there,
[03:28:29.440 --> 03:28:33.180]   Chair of Ophthalmology at Stanford, Jeff Goldberg,
[03:28:33.180 --> 03:28:35.240]   once asked him if he has any pets,
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:37.660]   and he said that he and his wife had three children
[03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:39.900]   as preparation for having a dog.
[03:28:39.900 --> 03:28:41.360]   - That's hilarious.
[03:28:41.360 --> 03:28:44.080]   There's a quote also from a book called "Don't Shoot the Dog,"
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:46.420]   which is a terrible title, but excellent book,
[03:28:46.420 --> 03:28:51.360]   written by Karen Pryor, who was an aquatic mammal trainer.
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:54.240]   So she was training dolphins and whales and so on,
[03:28:54.240 --> 03:28:57.440]   which don't respond to negative reinforcement.
[03:28:57.440 --> 03:28:59.240]   You can't really hit them with a rolled up newspaper
[03:28:59.240 --> 03:29:00.820]   if they don't do what you want.
[03:29:00.820 --> 03:29:02.860]   And there's a quote in that book,
[03:29:03.980 --> 03:29:05.380]   which is something along the lines of,
[03:29:05.380 --> 03:29:07.700]   I can't remember the attribution, it's another trainer,
[03:29:07.700 --> 03:29:10.760]   and it was, "People should not be allowed to have children
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:13.580]   "until they've successfully trained a chicken."
[03:29:13.580 --> 03:29:15.540]   [laughing]
[03:29:15.540 --> 03:29:18.620]   Because also chickens, they just don't have the brain power
[03:29:18.620 --> 03:29:22.820]   to respond to much negative reinforcement.
[03:29:22.820 --> 03:29:25.780]   So you have to coax them to do what you want them to do
[03:29:25.780 --> 03:29:27.500]   with positive reinforcement.
[03:29:27.500 --> 03:29:29.940]   And I mean, operating classical conditioning,
[03:29:29.940 --> 03:29:32.140]   it's kind of same-same across the board.
[03:29:32.140 --> 03:29:35.180]   Whether you're like the CIA trying to train cockroaches
[03:29:35.180 --> 03:29:38.060]   to flip lights, which is not making that one up, by the way,
[03:29:38.060 --> 03:29:42.240]   or training a whale or training a cat or training a human,
[03:29:42.240 --> 03:29:46.680]   training sounds bad, cultivating a wonderful human,
[03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:49.340]   then I think there's a lot to be learned across the board.
[03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:52.300]   So I've successfully proven to myself
[03:29:52.300 --> 03:29:55.020]   that I can keep a dog alive and happy.
[03:29:55.020 --> 03:29:57.780]   - Yeah, and train up another happy nervous system.
[03:29:57.780 --> 03:29:59.100]   - Yeah.
[03:29:59.100 --> 03:30:01.320]   - Curate another nervous system, that's a big deal.
[03:30:01.320 --> 03:30:04.420]   - Oh yeah, well, she's also like my external nervous system.
[03:30:04.420 --> 03:30:06.660]   So we sort of work in tandem.
[03:30:06.660 --> 03:30:09.260]   I pay a lot of attention to how she relates
[03:30:09.260 --> 03:30:10.820]   to different people.
[03:30:10.820 --> 03:30:12.520]   - Yeah, I saw earlier today, I mean,
[03:30:12.520 --> 03:30:14.660]   as someone who was the owner of a Bulldog Mastiff
[03:30:14.660 --> 03:30:17.140]   who knew one command, which was weight,
[03:30:17.140 --> 03:30:20.740]   which is by default the easiest thing to train a bulldog,
[03:30:20.740 --> 03:30:22.720]   because when you, by the way, folks,
[03:30:22.720 --> 03:30:25.480]   if you stop a bulldog on the street to scratch them
[03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:27.660]   and they look delighted, they might like you,
[03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:29.320]   but chances are they're just really relieved
[03:30:29.320 --> 03:30:32.080]   that they get to stop. (laughing)
[03:30:32.080 --> 03:30:37.220]   And Costello, he had a forebrain and he was smart
[03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:38.280]   about what he needed to be smart about,
[03:30:38.280 --> 03:30:40.980]   but Molly is exceptional, like she knows
[03:30:40.980 --> 03:30:43.440]   where she needs to be and she's super connected to you.
[03:30:43.440 --> 03:30:45.920]   And she knows a ton of commands, it was ridiculous.
[03:30:45.920 --> 03:30:48.580]   Our staff was like delighting in the number of things
[03:30:48.580 --> 03:30:51.020]   that Tim could get her to do just by looking at her.
[03:30:51.020 --> 03:30:56.020]   - Yeah, yeah, she's also quite calm out of the box,
[03:30:58.380 --> 03:31:01.420]   which helps, although it makes it harder in some respects
[03:31:01.420 --> 03:31:03.940]   to train because she doesn't have much food drive.
[03:31:03.940 --> 03:31:05.500]   - If you like those Maui Nui sticks,
[03:31:05.500 --> 03:31:06.340]   we were chomping around. - She did like
[03:31:06.340 --> 03:31:08.200]   the Maui Nui sticks, yeah, she loves the Maui Nui,
[03:31:08.200 --> 03:31:12.260]   venison sticks, but she, well, okay, I'll give,
[03:31:12.260 --> 03:31:13.180]   I'll say two things.
[03:31:13.180 --> 03:31:15.560]   So first is if your dog is a spaz about food,
[03:31:15.560 --> 03:31:16.980]   that's actually great news.
[03:31:16.980 --> 03:31:20.360]   It will make your dog very easy to train in some respects.
[03:31:20.360 --> 03:31:24.340]   Read Don't Shoot the Dog, it's excellent.
[03:31:24.340 --> 03:31:25.760]   And there are some others I could recommend.
[03:31:25.760 --> 03:31:30.460]   I had a woman named Susan Garrett on my podcast
[03:31:30.460 --> 03:31:32.780]   because I wanted an objective measure
[03:31:32.780 --> 03:31:34.660]   of successful dog training,
[03:31:34.660 --> 03:31:36.620]   and competitors have objective measures.
[03:31:36.620 --> 03:31:40.940]   So she was a dog agility champion for many years,
[03:31:40.940 --> 03:31:42.820]   which has a lot of metrics.
[03:31:42.820 --> 03:31:44.500]   So anyway, I had her on for people who are interested.
[03:31:44.500 --> 03:31:49.500]   But the tip that I got from one dog trainer early on,
[03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:51.180]   because I was trying to train Molly
[03:31:51.180 --> 03:31:52.700]   and I was using just some of her kibble.
[03:31:52.700 --> 03:31:55.220]   I'd like put some kibble in a bag and carry it around.
[03:31:55.220 --> 03:31:57.100]   And she was like, "What are you doing?"
[03:31:57.100 --> 03:31:58.460]   And I said, "What do you mean, what am I doing?"
[03:31:58.460 --> 03:31:59.420]   She's like, "Is that kibble?"
[03:31:59.420 --> 03:32:01.020]   I'm like, "Yeah, it's kibble."
[03:32:01.020 --> 03:32:03.300]   And she goes, she's like, "Hey pal."
[03:32:03.300 --> 03:32:04.460]   She's like, "You're at a crowded bar.
[03:32:04.460 --> 03:32:07.160]   You got to tip with 20s to get your dog's attention.
[03:32:07.160 --> 03:32:09.200]   You take your puppy to the dog park.
[03:32:09.200 --> 03:32:11.440]   It's like squirrels, other dogs, grass,
[03:32:11.440 --> 03:32:13.960]   piss on the pavement, whatever it happens to be.
[03:32:13.960 --> 03:32:15.040]   You have to have good treats.
[03:32:15.040 --> 03:32:16.300]   So if your dog isn't responding,
[03:32:16.300 --> 03:32:18.260]   chances are maybe you're trying to tip with singles.
[03:32:18.260 --> 03:32:20.860]   - I love it, I love it.
[03:32:20.860 --> 03:32:23.560]   Well, thank you for sharing the roles you see yourself in
[03:32:23.560 --> 03:32:27.740]   and the ones that you'd like to step into more.
[03:32:27.740 --> 03:32:30.080]   I certainly feel I have the jurisdiction to say
[03:32:30.080 --> 03:32:33.280]   that you are an exceptional experimentalist
[03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:35.500]   and a phenomenal teacher.
[03:32:35.500 --> 03:32:37.540]   We've seen this across so many.
[03:32:37.540 --> 03:32:38.380]   You're welcome.
[03:32:38.380 --> 03:32:39.820]   And I'm not just speaking for myself.
[03:32:39.820 --> 03:32:42.860]   I'm speaking for so many other people as well.
[03:32:42.860 --> 03:32:44.580]   We've seen this across so many domains.
[03:32:44.580 --> 03:32:47.620]   It's like blogging, podcasting, book writing,
[03:32:47.620 --> 03:32:52.620]   stage lecturing, being a guest on a podcast and on and on.
[03:32:52.820 --> 03:32:56.400]   And in terms of the roles that you want to expand into more,
[03:32:56.400 --> 03:33:01.060]   I can't wait to see the illustrations that emerge.
[03:33:01.060 --> 03:33:03.620]   Yeah, please do grow that flame
[03:33:03.620 --> 03:33:06.200]   because I'm excited for what comes out.
[03:33:06.200 --> 03:33:09.320]   Cockpunch being just the first of them.
[03:33:09.320 --> 03:33:10.260]   - Leading the charge.
[03:33:10.260 --> 03:33:11.900]   - Yeah.
[03:33:11.900 --> 03:33:16.900]   And I can say because I know, because I have one
[03:33:18.060 --> 03:33:23.060]   and because I have observed many kids and friends
[03:33:23.060 --> 03:33:26.420]   who are fathers, you're going to be an exceptional father.
[03:33:26.420 --> 03:33:28.340]   I'm absolutely confident of that.
[03:33:28.340 --> 03:33:29.300]   - Thanks, man.
[03:33:29.300 --> 03:33:30.140]   I appreciate that.
[03:33:30.140 --> 03:33:33.640]   - And I want to say thanks for taking the time
[03:33:33.640 --> 03:33:35.200]   to talk with me today.
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:37.000]   I've been looking forward to this so much.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:37.860]   My team knows this.
[03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:39.780]   Wait, we were sort of buzzing.
[03:33:39.780 --> 03:33:43.460]   We've had some heavy hitters on this podcast.
[03:33:43.460 --> 03:33:47.260]   We only look to the top 1% in field
[03:33:47.260 --> 03:33:49.860]   and they're incredibly credentialed
[03:33:49.860 --> 03:33:52.060]   by whatever standards we happen to be exploring.
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:55.120]   And they have to be people that I really want to talk to.
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:34:00.120]   So I have so much respect for what you do
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:01.660]   and the way you do it.
[03:34:01.660 --> 03:34:03.060]   You've certainly inspired me.
[03:34:03.060 --> 03:34:05.320]   This podcast would not exist.
[03:34:05.320 --> 03:34:08.020]   I don't think the genre of podcasting would exist
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:09.840]   and look the way that it does
[03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:12.860]   had you not made the decision to start podcasting.
[03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:15.700]   And in anticipation of this episode,
[03:34:15.700 --> 03:34:17.940]   I did put out a ping on Twitter for questions
[03:34:17.940 --> 03:34:20.180]   and there were many, many of them.
[03:34:20.180 --> 03:34:21.540]   Then maybe we'll do a Q&A sometime.
[03:34:21.540 --> 03:34:22.740]   Maybe not, who knows.
[03:34:22.740 --> 03:34:25.900]   But one of the questions that really stood out to me was,
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:27.820]   how does Tim feel about all these other people
[03:34:27.820 --> 03:34:29.780]   coming into all the spaces that he's worked
[03:34:29.780 --> 03:34:32.420]   and doing successful work
[03:34:32.420 --> 03:34:34.460]   that builds off so much of what he's done?
[03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:36.420]   And I'll let you answer.
[03:34:36.420 --> 03:34:40.860]   But for me, I can say that I've been positively inspired
[03:34:40.860 --> 03:34:43.380]   and built so much of what we've been doing here
[03:34:43.380 --> 03:34:46.360]   and what I think about based on the ways
[03:34:46.360 --> 03:34:48.740]   that you've podcasted and communicate with the public
[03:34:48.740 --> 03:34:50.900]   to maintain your stance and integrity
[03:34:50.900 --> 03:34:53.240]   in the way that you interact with people.
[03:34:53.240 --> 03:34:54.380]   It's really inspiring.
[03:34:54.380 --> 03:34:56.300]   And you've always been so gracious to me
[03:34:56.300 --> 03:34:58.700]   and so humble and so giving.
[03:34:58.700 --> 03:35:00.140]   And at the same time,
[03:35:00.140 --> 03:35:01.500]   I know there's a fierce guy in there
[03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:02.540]   who likes to get it done.
[03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:05.580]   So once again, thanks for being first man in.
[03:35:05.580 --> 03:35:08.140]   Thanks for taking on all the roles that you have
[03:35:08.140 --> 03:35:10.260]   and that you are and that you will.
[03:35:10.260 --> 03:35:12.340]   And thanks for being a giver.
[03:35:12.340 --> 03:35:13.300]   We all benefit.
[03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:14.180]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[03:35:14.180 --> 03:35:17.240]   I really appreciate you saying all that.
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:22.240]   And I want people to just get after it,
[03:35:22.240 --> 03:35:25.180]   take things seriously, have fun,
[03:35:25.180 --> 03:35:27.060]   and be really, really good.
[03:35:27.060 --> 03:35:30.220]   So watching, for instance, what you've done,
[03:35:30.220 --> 03:35:33.340]   which has been so spectacular, so well executed,
[03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:35.360]   makes me super happy.
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:39.700]   And I don't view anyone as competition
[03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:42.940]   in the podcasting world, for instance,
[03:35:42.940 --> 03:35:45.980]   in the book world, I don't view it that way either.
[03:35:45.980 --> 03:35:50.980]   And I just hope that people keep experimenting,
[03:35:50.980 --> 03:35:52.600]   pushing the envelope.
[03:35:52.600 --> 03:35:58.460]   And if people aren't, say, getting better over time,
[03:35:58.460 --> 03:36:00.980]   if people aren't following who are substantially better
[03:36:00.980 --> 03:36:02.620]   than me in all of these ways,
[03:36:02.620 --> 03:36:05.060]   then I would be super disappointed.
[03:36:05.060 --> 03:36:07.780]   So every time I see someone doing something really impressive
[03:36:07.780 --> 03:36:09.500]   or doing something I never would have thought of,
[03:36:09.500 --> 03:36:12.300]   I get so extremely excited.
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:14.300]   I find it really fun to watch.
[03:36:14.300 --> 03:36:19.300]   So appreciate you also getting out there and hard charging
[03:36:19.300 --> 03:36:21.900]   and taking your podcast as seriously as you do.
[03:36:21.900 --> 03:36:24.000]   I mean, I've seen the notes, I've seen the setup,
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:25.500]   I've met the team.
[03:36:25.500 --> 03:36:28.560]   It's very inspiring for me also.
[03:36:28.560 --> 03:36:31.620]   It makes me want to dust off my cleats
[03:36:31.620 --> 03:36:33.420]   and get back on the field.
[03:36:33.420 --> 03:36:34.980]   - Oh man, you've never left the field
[03:36:34.980 --> 03:36:36.260]   and you've had a hand in it all.
[03:36:36.260 --> 03:36:37.500]   So thank you so much.
[03:36:37.500 --> 03:36:41.560]   And I hope you'll come back and visit us again here.
[03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:42.820]   - Yeah, I hope so.
[03:36:42.820 --> 03:36:44.040]   It's been a real pleasure.
[03:36:44.040 --> 03:36:46.720]   I've been looking forward to this for a long time as well.
[03:36:46.720 --> 03:36:50.220]   And I appreciate you inviting me on.
[03:36:50.220 --> 03:36:51.060]   - Till next time.
[03:36:51.060 --> 03:36:52.240]   - Till next time, man.
[03:36:52.240 --> 03:36:53.100]   - Thank you for joining me
[03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.000]   for today's discussion with Tim Ferriss.
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:36:57.360]   I hope you found it to be as informative
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:36:59.300]   and as actionable as I did.
[03:36:59.300 --> 03:37:00.920]   For links to Tim's books,
[03:37:00.920 --> 03:37:03.580]   as well as for a link to his weekly blog,
[03:37:03.580 --> 03:37:05.060]   please see the show note captions.
[03:37:05.060 --> 03:37:06.720]   You'll also find a link to Tim's podcast,
[03:37:06.720 --> 03:37:08.260]   the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[03:37:08.260 --> 03:37:10.240]   And I highly recommend that you subscribe
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:12.940]   and listen to the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[03:37:12.940 --> 03:37:15.540]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,
[03:37:15.540 --> 03:37:17.240]   please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

[03:37:23.460 --> 03:37:25.000]   And on both Spotify and Apple,
[03:37:25.000 --> 03:37:27.320]   you can leave us up to a five-star review.
[03:37:27.320 --> 03:37:29.960]   If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast

[03:37:31.540 --> 03:37:33.200]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:37:33.200 --> 03:37:35.640]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[03:37:35.640 --> 03:37:37.640]   I do read all the comments.
[03:37:37.640 --> 03:37:39.440]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:41.400]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[03:37:41.400 --> 03:37:43.900]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[03:37:43.900 --> 03:37:44.920]   Not on today's episode,
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:47.400]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:48.880]   we discuss supplements.
[03:37:48.880 --> 03:37:51.060]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:37:51.060 --> 03:37:53.120]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:37:53.120 --> 03:37:54.680]   for things like enhancing sleep,
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:37:56.920]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:37:59.040]   The Huberman Lab podcast is proud to have partnered
[03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:00.280]   with Momentous Supplements.
[03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:01.400]   To see the supplements discussed
[03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:02.600]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:38:02.600 --> 03:38:04.620]   go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,
[03:38:04.620 --> 03:38:07.120]   so that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:10.360]   Again, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:12.640]   If you're not already following us on social media,
[03:38:12.640 --> 03:38:15.640]   I am @hubermanlab on Instagram, Twitter,
[03:38:15.640 --> 03:38:16.960]   Facebook, and LinkedIn.
[03:38:16.960 --> 03:38:18.360]   And at all those places,
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:20.200]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:38:20.200 --> 03:38:21.760]   some of which overlaps with the content
[03:38:21.760 --> 03:38:23.280]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:38:23.280 --> 03:38:25.560]   but much of which often does not overlap
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:27.280]   with the content of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:38:27.280 --> 03:38:30.960]   So again, it's @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:32.500]   In addition, if you haven't subscribed
[03:38:32.500 --> 03:38:34.320]   to our neural network newsletter,
[03:38:34.320 --> 03:38:36.560]   it's a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[03:38:36.560 --> 03:38:38.600]   that provides summaries of podcast episodes,
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:40.040]   as well as toolkits.
[03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:42.140]   For instance, toolkits for optimizing sleep,
[03:38:42.140 --> 03:38:44.400]   or toolkits for learning in neuroplasticity,
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:45.760]   or for deliberate cold exposure,
[03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:47.720]   or for dopamine, and on and on.
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:49.360]   To sign up for the neural network newsletter,
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:51.840]   simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:53.880]   scroll down to newsletter, and provide your email.
[03:38:53.880 --> 03:38:56.360]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:38:56.360 --> 03:38:57.640]   Thank you once again for joining me
[03:38:57.640 --> 03:38:59.640]   for today's discussion with Tim Ferriss.
[03:38:59.640 --> 03:39:01.880]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:03.720]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:06.300]   (upbeat music)
[03:39:06.300 --> 03:39:08.360]   you
