[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140]   Well, we won't endure alone.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.820]   We need one another.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.920]   And the book of Hebrews is very clear on this point in Hebrews 3, verses 12 to 14.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.400]   There we are commanded to "take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.340]   heart leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.040]   But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, that none of you may
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.660]   be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin; for we have come to share in Christ, if indeed
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.960]   we hold our original confidence firm to the end."
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.520]   That's a great text, important point.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.080]   If we are to endure to the end, we need one another as we fight to see Christ as better
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.760]   than all the false promises of this world.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.600]   Here's Pastor John applying this text.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.360]   If the essence of deceit, sin, hardness, unbelief, falling away, eternal destruction, if the
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:13.840]   essence of the deceit is "God is less to be desired than blank," what are you going to
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.840]   say?
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.840]   He's better.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   He's better.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.520]   Christ is better.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.640]   His way is better.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.760]   And a thousand experiential and biblical ways of showing that he's better, that's what you're
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.200]   going to say, right?
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.680]   And if that's right, and Hebrews 11 illustrates it with, "Even the reproaches of Christ are
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.880]   better than the pleasures of Egypt," chapter 11, verse 26.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.440]   Even the reproaches of the Christ are greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   If that's the positive things we're going to say, the negative also true.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.560]   You're going to die if you don't turn around.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.400]   You're going to say, "The pleasures of Egypt are fleeting.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.960]   Don't go there.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.920]   You will perish in the Red Sea.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   If you go there, you'll die in the wilderness.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.560]   If you go there, and we will warn them."
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.600]   I have a letter here.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.040]   This is sent to me.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   I love to save letters.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.720]   This is back when people wrote letters, 1992, handwritten by a young woman who was going
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:44.360]   here in the '80s, and she was living in fornication, and her conscience was bothering her, and
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   she came to see me.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.840]   I threw that out, and after a little while, I said to her, "You know, don't you, that
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.920]   if you continue in this, you'll go to hell," is what she wrote seven years later.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.880]   1985, so it's written in '92.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.680]   1985, I wonder whether you remember a very much younger me sitting in your office and
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.560]   telling you I was afraid God would have to use a car accident or some other awful event
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.520]   to get my attention.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.760]   You pointed out that the consequences of my deliberate choice to continue sinning would
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000]   be nothing short of hell itself.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.680]   No one had ever before told me I was headed for hell, missionary kid, that I was "saved"
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.040]   at age six.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.920]   It was a turning point in my life, and I have wanted to thank you and tell you that ever
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.920]   since.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:51.880]   I assured Mom that a warning such as that in 1985 conversation made me feel the more
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   loved after I heard what you really think of it in listening to your message.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.200]   That you cared enough to tell me a stranger at the time means more than ever with the
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.000]   echo in my ears, your compassion came through to me.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.080]   You say he's better, and you say, "If you don't turn and fight this, you're going to
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   perish."
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.080]   You say that to your roommate.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.440]   You say it to your child.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.840]   Maybe one more story and a closing word.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.480]   I've seen Tom sitting back there, I love Tom Steller.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:46.720]   Few people have strengthened my hand in the Lord more than Tom for 37 years, longer actually.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.280]   We've done a lot of things together.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.640]   You'll remember this one, Tom.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:05:00.040]   There's a woman in the 80s again who was struggling with such terrible depression, and she was
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.400]   suicidal, scary so.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.520]   We were young, we didn't know much, but we made her promise us, we were in this together,
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.800]   we made her promise us, "You will not hurt yourself without calling us."
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Can you promise?
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   I promise.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   All right.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   So late one night, I get a call, "Tom, no."
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.040]   I say, "Look, you must promise me, promise me right now, I'm going to call the police.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.360]   Promise me that you'll meet us at the church within 15 minutes."
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.640]   We both lived close by, so did she, to church, she did.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.320]   The building is gone now, but I can picture where we sat in the 1914 building.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.800]   And we sat with her, how long, Tom?
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.120]   Two, three hours?
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.840]   The darkness in that room, spiritually, was awful.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.960]   You could just see it was like a huge, heavy, wet, dark blanket.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.400]   Everything about her was oppressed.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.680]   And we exhorted her and gave promises to her and prayed with her and sat in silence with
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.360]   her, and God lifted that darkness.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.960]   You could see it lift.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.800]   That woman is in this church ministering today.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.440]   And I believe, Tom, we saved her.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.040]   We did.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   God Almighty used us with words and prayer to save her, both from physical and probably
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   spiritual destruction.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.440]   Leave you with one picture of what you're called to do.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.240]   In 1 Samuel 23, David's life is in the balance.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:56.800]   The people of the town of Keilah have betrayed him, and the prophet tells him, "They're going
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   to betray you."
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.240]   So he escapes and leaves Keilah.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   At the end of the chapter, the Ziphites treacherously tell Saul quietly where David is, and Saul
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.720]   comes after him.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.120]   David finds out, he escapes by the skin of his teeth.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.080]   I've tried to imagine the pressure of doing ministry like that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.320]   Pressure, stress, tension, discouragement.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.440]   And you want to say, "Is it worth it to be the Lord's anointed?"
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.840]   And you will say that.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.080]   "Is it worth it to be a Christian?
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.640]   Is it worth it to be a pastor?"
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.480]   How are you going to survive in those moments?
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.400]   How did David survive?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.240]   Well, I think the chapter is arranged this way, between the betrayal and the treachery,
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:56.120]   right in the middle here is verse 16, "And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went to David
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.840]   at Horash and strengthened his hand in God."
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.440]   You got a friend like that?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.760]   Be that for each other.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.800]   Be that for each other.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:17.840]   We can't survive without God's mercy horizontally mediated to us.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:26.440]   So exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today, lest there be in any of
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:33.800]   you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.800]   Serious.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.240]   It's a glorious calling.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Amen.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240]   That is a glorious calling.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   As we carry for one another, as we seek to hold our original confidence firm to the end.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.520]   This clip is from John Piper's sermon titled, "We Need Each Other.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.640]   Christian Fellowship is a Means of Perseverance."
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.060]   A sermon on Hebrews chapter 3, verses 12 to 14, preached on April 12th, 2017.
[00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.640]   This entire message is available right now at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.400]   And this clip was submitted by a longtime podcast listener named Richie, who lives in
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   Chandigarh, India.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.600]   That's in northern India.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.960]   In Chandigarh, India.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.360]   Thank you, Richie, for sending it in to us.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.320]   Clips like this one are crowdsourced.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.680]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons catch your ear, and we share that clip with the
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   APJ audience.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.920]   If you've got one, email me.

[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.600]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.820]   We are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.560]   Faith is really important, and next time we're going to look at the question of why does
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.960]   God allow suffering in our lives, especially the kind of suffering that may harm our faith
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   in him.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   It's a significant question.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   You won't want to miss it.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   That's up on Friday.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.440]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   [END]
