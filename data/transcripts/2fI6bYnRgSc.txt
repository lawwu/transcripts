[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   The following is a conversation with Dava Newman.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.120]   She's the Apollo Program Professor at MIT
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920]   and the former Deputy Administrator of NASA
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.720]   and has been a principal investigator
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.120]   on four spaceflight missions.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.040]   Her research interests are in aerospace
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.240]   biomedical engineering, investigating human performance
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.400]   in varying gravity environments.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.320]   She has designed and engineered and built
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.640]   some incredible spacesuit technology,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.560]   namely the bio suit that we talk about in this conversation.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.600]   Due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.880]   we only had about 40 minutes together.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.120]   And in true engineering style, she said,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.920]   I talk fast, you pick the best questions,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.280]   let's get it done.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.360]   And we did.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440]   It was a fascinating conversation about space exploration
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.320]   and the future of spacesuits.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.480]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.760]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   give it five stars on Apple Podcast,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.200]   support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   Alex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.560]   For the first time, this show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.040]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.080]   Cash App is the easiest way to send money to your friends.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.280]   And it is also the easiest way to buy,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.160]   sell and deposit Bitcoin.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.920]   Most Bitcoin exchanges take days for bank transfer
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.520]   to become investable.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.760]   Through Cash App, it takes seconds.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.360]   Invest as little as $1 and now you own Bitcoin.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.280]   I have several conversations about Bitcoin
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.040]   coming up on this podcast.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.640]   Decentralized digital currency
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.440]   is a fascinating technology in general to explore,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.680]   both at the technical and the philosophical level.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.920]   Cash App is also the easiest way to try and grow your money
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   with their new investing feature.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.760]   Unlike investing tools that force you
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.640]   to buy entire shares of stock,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.000]   Cash App amazingly lets you instantly invest
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.240]   as little or as much as you want.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.320]   Some stocks in the market are hundreds,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320]   not thousands of dollars per share.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.080]   And now you can still own a piece with as little as $1.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.280]   Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.160]   a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.920]   I'm also excited to be working with Cash App
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.080]   to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.240]   which is best known for their FIRST Robotics
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.720]   and Lego competitions that seeks to inspire young students
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.520]   in engineering and technology fields all over the world.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.760]   That's over 110 countries, 660,000 students,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280]   300,000 mentors and volunteers,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.320]   and a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.080]   which means the donated money
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.880]   is used to maximum effectiveness.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.440]   When you sign up for Cash App

[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.080]   inspire girls and boys to learn, to explore,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.920]   and to dream of engineering a better world.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.960]   Don't forget to use the code LEXPODCAST

[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.760]   And now here's my conversation with Deva Newman.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   You circumnavigated the globe on boat.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.680]   So let's look back in history.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.200]   500 years ago, Ferdinand Magellan's crew
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.200]   was first to circumnavigate the globe, but he died.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.600]   I think people don't know, like halfway through,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.800]   and so did 242 of the 260 sailors
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.240]   that took that three-year journey.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.320]   What do you think it was like for that crew at that time,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.080]   heading out into the unknown to face probably likely death?
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.880]   Do you think they were filled with fear, with excitement?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.040]   Probably not fear.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.000]   I think in all of exploration,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.520]   the challenge and the unknown, so probably wonderment.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.000]   And then just when you really are sailing
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   the world's oceans, you have extreme weather of all kinds.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.760]   When we were circumnavigating, it was challenging,
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.280]   a new dynamic you really appreciate, Mother Earth,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.640]   you appreciate the winds and the waves.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.920]   So back to Magellan and his crew,
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   since they really didn't have a three-dimensional map
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.680]   of the globe, of the Earth when they went out,
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.080]   just probably looking over the horizon,
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.360]   thinking what's there, what's there?
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.720]   So I would say the challenge had to be really important
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.760]   in terms of the team dynamics and that leadership
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.880]   had to be incredibly important.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.480]   Team dynamics, how do you keep people focused on the mission?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   - So you think the psychology, that's interesting.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.200]   There's probably echoes of that
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.640]   in the space exploration stuff we'll talk about.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.720]   So the psychology of the dynamics between the human beings
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   on the mission is important?
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.880]   For a Mars mission, there's lots of challenges,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.840]   technology, but since I specialize
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.600]   in keeping my astronauts alive, the psychosocial issues,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.440]   the psychology of psychosocial team dynamics, leadership,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.320]   we're all people, so that's always a huge impact,
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.840]   one of the top three, I think,
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   of any isolated, confined environment,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.920]   in any mission that is really pretty extreme.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.160]   - So your Twitter handle is @davexplorer.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.280]   So when did you first fall in love
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.760]   with the idea of exploration?
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.480]   - Ah, that's a great question.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.560]   Maybe as long as I can remember,
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.080]   as I grew up in Montana, in the Rocky Mountains,
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   in Helena, the capital, and so literally,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.480]   Mount Helena was my backyard, was right up there.
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.080]   So exploring, being in the mountains, looking at caves,
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.760]   just running around, but always being in nature.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.320]   So since my earliest memory is I think of myself
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.720]   as kind of exploring the natural beauty
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.960]   of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.160]   - So exploration is not limited to any domain,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   it's just anything, so the natural domain of any kind,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.680]   going out into the woods, into a place you haven't been,
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.920]   it's all exploration.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.320]   - I think so, yeah, I have a pretty all-encompassing
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.760]   definition of exploration.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.160]   - So what about space exploration?
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.840]   When were you first captivated by the idea
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.120]   that we little humans could venture out into the space,
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.720]   into the great unknown of space?
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.400]   - Oh, it's a great year to talk about that,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.640]   the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11,
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.720]   since I was alive during Apollo,
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.840]   and specifically Apollo 11, I was five years old,
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.960]   and I distinctly remember that.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.920]   I remember that humanity, I'm sure I probably
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.800]   didn't know their names at the time,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.560]   there's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.820]   and never forget Michael Collins in orbit.
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.440]   Those three men doing something that just seemed impossible,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.920]   seemed impossible a decade earlier, even a year earlier,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.580]   but so the Apollo program really inspired me,
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.640]   and then I think it actually just taught me to dream,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.480]   to any impossible mission could be possible
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.040]   with enough focus.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.160]   I'm sure you need some luck,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.760]   but you definitely need the leadership,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.160]   you need the focus of the mission.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.280]   So since an early age, I thought,
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.200]   of course, people should be interplanetary,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.520]   of course, we need people on Earth,
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.960]   and we're gonna have people exploring space as well.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.280]   - That seemed obvious, even at that age, of course.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.260]   - It opened it up.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.080]   Before we saw men on the moon,
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.140]   it wasn't obvious to me at all,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.640]   but once we understood that, yes, absolutely,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.720]   astronauts, that's what they do,
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.080]   they explore, they go into space,
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.500]   and they land on other planets or moons.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.680]   - So again, maybe a romanticized, philosophical question,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.680]   but when you look up at the stars,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.840]   knowing that there's at least 100 billion of them
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.400]   in the Milky Way galaxy, right?
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.760]   So we're really a small speck in this giant thing
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.600]   that's the visible universe.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.300]   How does that make you feel about our efforts here?
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.800]   - I love the perspective, I love that perspective.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.660]   I always open my public talks
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.740]   with a big Hubble Space Telescope image,
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.280]   looking out into, you mentioned just now,
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.840]   the solar system, the Milky Way,
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.040]   'cause I think it's really important to know
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   that we're just a small, pale blue dot.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.700]   We're really fortunate, we're on the best planet by far.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.460]   Life is fantastic here.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.300]   - That we know of.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.060]   You're confident this is the best planet?
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.420]   - I'm pretty sure it's the best planet,
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.780]   the best planet that we know of.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.620]   I mean, I search my research, as you know,
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.020]   in mission worlds, and when will we find life?
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.220]   I think actually probably the next decade
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.780]   we find probably past life,
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.580]   probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let's say.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.300]   - You think there was once life on Mars?
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.660]   Or do you think there's currently?
[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.180]   - I'm more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.900]   feel pretty confident there was life on Mars,
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.540]   just because then it had an electromagnetic shield,
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.780]   it had an atmosphere, has a wonderful gravity level,
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.340]   3HG is fantastic, you're all super human,
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.980]   we can all slam dunk in basketball,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.580]   it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.180]   So I think we'll find past,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.400]   no, fossilized probably the evidence of past life on Mars.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.460]   Currently, that's again, we need the next decade,
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.580]   but the evidence is mounting for sure.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.860]   We do have the organics, we're finding organics,
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.380]   we have water, seasonal water on Mars.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.660]   We used to just know about the ice caps,
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.580]   you know, North and South Pole,
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.180]   now we have seasonal water.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.300]   We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.540]   We really need to dig down into the soil,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.500]   'cause everything on the top surface is radiated,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.020]   but once we find out, will we see any life forms,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.860]   will we see any bugs?
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.180]   I leave it open as a possibility,
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.340]   but I feel pretty certain that past life
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.940]   or fossilized life forms we'll find.
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.340]   And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.380]   these beautiful moons of other planets,
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.620]   since we know they have water,
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.500]   and we're looking for simple search for life,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.620]   or follow the water, you know, carbon-based life,
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.960]   that's the only life we know.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.660]   There could be other life forms that we don't know about,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.700]   but it's hard to search for them, 'cause we don't know.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.180]   So in our search for life in the solar system,
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.780]   it's definitely, you know, search,
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.140]   you know, let's follow the water,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.220]   and look for the building blocks of life.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.460]   - So you think in the next decade,
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.340]   we might see hints of past life or even current life?
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.180]   - I think so.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.820]   That's pretty optimistic. - I love the optimism.
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.660]   - I'm pretty optimistic.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.020]   - Do humans have to be involved,
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.660]   or can this be robots and rovers and--
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.140]   - Probably teams, I mean, we've been at it,
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.820]   on Mars in particular, 50 years.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.820]   We've been exploring Mars for 50 years.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.700]   Great data, right?
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.940]   Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.220]   Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.260]   You know, we're starting to know,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.060]   because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.060]   We know about the water on Mars.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.620]   So we've been studying 50 years with our robots.
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.580]   We still haven't found it.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.820]   So I think once we have a human mission there,
[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.940]   we just accelerate things.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.460]   It's always humans and our rovers and robots together,
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.860]   but we just have to think that 50 years,
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.620]   we've been looking at Mars,
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.020]   and taking images and doing the best science that we can.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.420]   People need to realize Mars is really far away.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.660]   It's really hard to get to.
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.100]   You know, this is extreme, extreme exploration.
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.420]   We mentioned Magellan first,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.100]   which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.540]   Mars is a different ball game.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.620]   I mean, it's eight months to get there,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.180]   year and a half to get home.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.580]   I mean, it's really extreme.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.740]   - Harsh environment in all kinds of ways.
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.300]   But the kind of organism we might be able to see hints of
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.820]   on Mars are kind of microorganisms, perhaps.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.460]   - Yeah, and remember that humans,
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.900]   we're kind of, you know, we're hosts, right?
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.860]   We're hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.940]   - Do you think it's a big leap from the viruses
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.180]   and the bacteria to us humans?
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.460]   Put another way, do you think on all those moons,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.220]   beautiful, wet moons that you mentioned,
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.820]   you think there's intelligent life out there?
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.660]   - I hope so.
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.660]   I mean, that's the hope,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.980]   but we don't have the scientific evidence for that now.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.420]   I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.980]   is much more compelling, again,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.340]   'cause we have the building blocks of life now.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.220]   When that life turns into intelligence,
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.900]   that's a big unknown.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   - If we ever meet,
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.180]   do you think we would be able to find a common language?
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.060]   - I hope so.
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.100]   We haven't met yet.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:39.980]   It's just so far.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.020]   I mean, do physics just play a role here?
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.420]   Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.860]   I mean, even the couple dozen Earth-like planets
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.460]   that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.480]   These are very Earth-like.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.940]   They look like they have all the building blocks.
[00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:54.780]   I can't wait to get there.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.820]   The only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.200]   So scientifically, we know they're there.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.540]   We know that they're habitable.
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.740]   They have everything going for them, right?
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.940]   In the Goldilocks zone, not too hot, not too cold,
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.580]   just perfect for habitability for life.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.220]   But now the reality is if they're 10, at the best,
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.700]   to 100, to thousands of light years away.
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.580]   So what's out there?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.980]   But I just can't think that we're not the only ones.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.260]   So absolutely life, life in the universe,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.020]   probably intelligent life as well.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.020]   - Do you think there needs to be fundamental revolutions
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.980]   in how we, the tools we use to travel through space
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.020]   in order for us to venture outside of our solar system?
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.820]   Or do you think the ways, the rockets,
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.700]   the ideas we have now, the engineering ideas we have now
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.100]   will be enough to venture out?
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:43.980]   - Well, it's a good question.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.140]   Right now, 'cause again, speed of light is a limit.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.980]   We don't have warp speed, warp drive.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.900]   To explore our solar system, to get to Mars,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.700]   explore all the planets, then we need technology push,
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.700]   but technology push here is just advanced propulsion.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.180]   It'd be great if I could get humans to Mars
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.460]   in say three to four months, not eight months.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.540]   I mean, half the time, 50% reduction.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.100]   That's great in terms of safety and wellness of the crew.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.700]   Orbital mechanics, but physics rules.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.340]   Orbital mechanics is still there.
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.260]   Physics rules, we can't defy physics.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.100]   - I love that.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.180]   - Invent a new physics.
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.260]   I mean, look at quantum theories.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.100]   - Yeah, you never know.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.300]   - Exactly, I mean, we are always learning.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.940]   So we definitely don't know all the physics that exist too,
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.220]   but we still have to, it's not science fiction.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.220]   We still have to pay attention to physics
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.420]   in terms of our speed of travel for space flight.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.900]   - So you were the deputy administrator of NASA
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.220]   during the Obama administration.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.540]   There's a current Artemis program
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.340]   that's working on a crewed mission to the moon
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.440]   and then perhaps to Mars.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.520]   What are you excited about there?
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.100]   What are your thoughts on this program?
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.900]   What are the biggest challenges do you think
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.660]   of getting to the moon, of landing to the moon once again,
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.420]   and then the big step to Mars?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.780]   - Well, I love the moon program now.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.540]   Artemis is definitely, we've been in low Earth orbit.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.580]   I love low Earth orbit too,
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.880]   but I just always look at it as three phases.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.980]   So low Earth orbit where we've been 40 years,
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.080]   so definitely time to get back to deep space,
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.020]   time to get to the moon.
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.700]   There's so much to do on the moon.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.100]   I hope we don't get stuck on the moon for 50 years.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.020]   I really want to get to the moon, spend the next decade
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.780]   first with the lander, then humans.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:21.940]   There's just a lot to explore,
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.420]   but to me it's a big technology push.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.340]   It's only three days away,
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.700]   so the moon is definitely the right place.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.620]   So we kind of buy down our technology,
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.860]   we invest in specifically habitats, life support systems.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.420]   We need suits, we really need to understand
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.780]   really how to live off planet.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.460]   We've been off planet and low Earth orbit,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.780]   but still that's only 400 kilometers up, 250 miles, right?
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.700]   So we get to the moon, it really is a great proving ground
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.420]   for the technologies, and now we're in deep space,
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.980]   radiation becomes a huge issue
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.420]   to keep our astronauts well and alive.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.420]   And I look at all of that investment for moon exploration
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.700]   to the ultimate goal, the horizon goals we call it,
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.860]   to get people to Mars.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.700]   But we just don't go to Mars tomorrow, right?
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.740]   We really need a decade on the moon, I think,
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.660]   investing in the technologies, learning,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.980]   making sure the astronauts are, their health,
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.740]   they're safe and well, and also learning so much
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.940]   about in-situ research, utilization, ISRU,
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.100]   in-situ resource utilization is huge
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.220]   when it comes to exploration for the moon and Mars.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.300]   So we need a test bed, and to me,
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.900]   it really is a lunar test bed.
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.340]   And then we use those same investments
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.580]   to think about getting people to Mars in the 2030s.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.060]   - So developing sort of a platform
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.460]   of all the kind of research tools,
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.260]   of all the, what's the resource utilization,
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.100]   can you speak to that?
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.040]   - Yeah, so ISRU for the moon, it's,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.220]   we'll go to the South Pole, and it's fascinating,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.020]   we have images of it, of course,
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.060]   we know there's permanently shaded areas,
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.900]   and like by Shackleton Crater,
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.340]   and there's areas that are permanently in the sun.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.220]   Well, it seems that there's a lot of water, ice,
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.660]   you know, water that's trapped in ice,
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.260]   and the lunar craters, that's the first place you go.
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.100]   Why?
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.860]   Because it's water, and when you wanna try to,
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.180]   it could be fuel, you know, life support systems,
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.820]   so you kinda, again, you go where the water is.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.680]   And so when the moon is kind of for resources, utilization,
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.100]   but to learn how to, can we make the fuels
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.900]   out of the resources that are on the moon?
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.220]   We have to think about 3D printing, right?
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.100]   You don't get to bring all this mass with you.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.780]   You have to learn how to literally live off the land.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.020]   We need a pressure shell, we need to have an atmosphere
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.340]   for people to live in.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.040]   So all of that is gonna bind down the technology,
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.940]   doing the investigation, doing the science,
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.340]   what are the, basically, we call them lunar volatiles,
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.140]   you know, what is that ice on the moon,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.140]   how much of it is there, what do the resources look like?
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.300]   To me, that helps us, that's just the next step
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.460]   in getting humans to Mars.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.780]   - And it's cheaper and more effective
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.140]   to sort of develop some of these difficult challenges,
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.620]   like solve some of these challenges,
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.940]   practice, develop, test, and so on on the moon.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.980]   - Absolutely. - That is on Mars.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.380]   - Absolutely, and people are gonna love to,
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.460]   you know, you get to the moon, you get to,
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.860]   you have a beautiful Earth rise,
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.700]   I mean, you have the most magnificent view
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.460]   of Earth being off planet, so it just makes sense.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.300]   I think we're gonna have thousands, lots of people,
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.820]   hopefully tens of thousands in low-Earth orbit,
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.940]   'cause low-Earth orbit is a beautiful place to go
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.060]   and look down on the Earth, but people wanna return home,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.980]   think the lunar explorers will also wanna do
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.740]   round trips and, you know, be on the moon,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.820]   three-day trip, explore, do science,
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.980]   also because the lunar day is, you know,
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.540]   14 days and lunar night's also 14 days,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.020]   so in that 28-day cycle, you know,
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.220]   half of it is in light, half of it's in dark.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.820]   So people would probably wanna do, you know,
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.700]   couple-week trips, month-long trips, not longer than that.
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.100]   - What do you mean by people?
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.380]   What do you-- - People, explorers.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.220]   I mean-- - Explorer?
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.580]   - Yeah, astronauts are gonna be civilians in the future too,
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.900]   not all astronauts are gonna be government,
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.180]   astronauts, actually, when I was at NASA,
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.780]   we changed, we actually got the law changed
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.540]   to recognize astronauts that are not only
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.340]   government employees, you know, NASA astronauts
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.820]   or European Space Agency astronauts
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.940]   or Russian Space Agency, that astronauts,
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.300]   because of the big push we put in the private sector,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.900]   that astronauts, essentially, are gonna be astronauts
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.800]   who get over 100 kilometers up,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.500]   and I think once you've done orbital flight,
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.760]   then you're an astronaut, so a lot of private citizens
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.380]   are gonna become astronauts.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.340]   - Do you think one day you might step foot on the moon?
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.540]   - I think it'd be good to go to the moon,
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.180]   I'd give that a shot.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.100]   Mars, I'm gonna, it's my life's work
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.300]   to get the next generation to Mars,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.900]   that's you or even younger than you,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.900]   you know, my students' generation
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.640]   will be the Martian explorers.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.900]   I'm just working to facilitate that,
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.220]   but that's not gonna be me.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.860]   - Hey, the moon's pretty good, and it's a lot tough,
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.820]   I mean, it's still a really tough mission.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.260]   - It's an extreme mission, exactly,
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.940]   it's great for exploration, but doable,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.740]   but again, before Apollo, we didn't think
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.980]   getting humans to the moon was even possible,
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.620]   so we kind of made that possible,
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.940]   but we need to go back, we absolutely need to go back,
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.400]   we're investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.100]   that we need to get there, we haven't had that
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.940]   since the Apollo days, since Saturn V,
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.460]   so now we have three options on the board,
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.480]   that's what's so fantastic,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.760]   NASA has its space launch system,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.700]   SpaceX is gonna have its heavy capability,
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.300]   and Blue Origin is coming along too with heavy lift,
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.820]   so that's pretty fantastic from where I sit,
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.900]   I'm the Apollo program professor,
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.060]   today I have zero heavy lift launch capability,
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.660]   I can't wait, just in a few years,
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.020]   we'll have three different heavy lift launch capabilities,
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.120]   so that's pretty exciting.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.580]   - You know, your heart is perhaps with NASA,
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.500]   but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin,
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.900]   what are your thoughts of SpaceX
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.700]   and the innovative efforts there
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.380]   from the sort of private company aspect?
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.820]   - Oh, they're great, remember that the investments
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.420]   in SpaceX is government funding,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.220]   it's NASA funding, it's US Air Force funding,
[00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.340]   just as it should be, because they're betting on a company
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.380]   who is moving fast, has some new technology development,
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.220]   so I love it, so when I was at NASA,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.340]   it really was under our public-private partnerships,
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.440]   so necessarily, the government needs to fund
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.240]   these startups, now SpaceX is no longer a startup,
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.220]   but it's been at it for 10 years,
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.640]   it's had some accidents, learned a lot of lessons,
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.800]   but it's great, because it's the way you move faster,
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.260]   and also, some private industry folks
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.740]   and private businesses will take a lot more risk,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.380]   that's also really important for the government.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.980]   - What do you think about that culture of risk?
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.340]   I mean, sort of NASA and the government
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.180]   are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe,
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.140]   like there's a little bit more of a culture
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.480]   of caution and safety, and sort of this kind
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.620]   of solid engineering, and I think SpaceX,
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.100]   while it has the same kind of stuff,
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.140]   it has a little bit more of that startup feel,
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.860]   where they take the bigger risk.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.740]   Is that exciting for you to see,
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.820]   seeing bigger risks in this kind of space?
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.220]   - Absolutely, and the best scenario
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.580]   is both of them working together,
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.140]   because there's really important lessons learned,
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.920]   especially when you talk about human spaceflight,
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.300]   safety, quality assurance, these things
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.860]   are the utmost importance, both aviation and space,
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.300]   when human lives are at stake.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.820]   On the other hand, government agencies,
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.860]   NASA can be a European space agency, you name it,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.820]   they become very bureaucratic, pretty risk-averse,
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.140]   move pretty slowly, so I think the best
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.200]   is when you combine the partnerships from both sides.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.420]   Industry necessarily has to push the government,
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.200]   take some more risk, you know, like there's smart risk,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.000]   I actually gave an award at NASA for failing smart.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.060]   (laughing)
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.580]   - Failing smart, I love that.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.940]   - Yeah, so you can kind of break open the culture,
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.380]   say, no, look at Apollo, that was a huge risk,
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.700]   it was done well, so there's always a culture
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.380]   of safety, quality assurance, engineering, at its best,
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.140]   but on the other hand, you wanna get things done,
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.140]   and you have to also bring the cost down,
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.980]   for when it comes to launch,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.060]   we really have to bring the cost down
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.020]   and get the frequency up, and so that's
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.580]   what the newcomers are doing, they're really pushing that,
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.880]   so it's about the most exciting time
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.740]   that I can imagine for spaceflight,
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.840]   again, a little bit, it really is the democratization
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.380]   of spaceflight, opening it up,
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.240]   not just because the launch capability,
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.600]   but the science we can do on a CubeSat,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.960]   what you can do now, those used to be student projects
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.120]   that we would go through, conceive, design, implement,
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.400]   and think about what a small satellite would be,
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.840]   now, these are really advanced instruments,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.060]   science instruments that are flying
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.280]   on little, teeny CubeSats that pretty much
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.880]   anyone can afford, so there's not a,
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.900]   there's every nation, every place in the world
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.040]   can fly a CubeSat, and so that's--
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:11.960]   - What's a CubeSat?
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.240]   - Oh, CubeSat is a, this is called 1U,
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.040]   CubeSats we measure in terms of units,
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.060]   so just in terms of, I put both my hands together,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.600]   that's one unit, two units, three,
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.800]   so little, small satellites, so CubeSats
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.080]   are for small satellites, and we actually
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.600]   go by mass as well, small satellite might be
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.440]   100 kilos, 200 kilos, well under 1,000 kilos,
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.240]   CubeSats then are the next thing down from small sats,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.520]   basically kilos, tens of kilos, things like that,
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.240]   but kind of the building blocks,
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.560]   CubeSats are fantastic design,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.120]   'cause it's kind of modular design,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.960]   so I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.340]   and what if I have a little bit more money in payload,
[00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.520]   I can fly three of 'em, and just basically
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.120]   put a lot more instruments on it,
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.600]   but essentially, think about something
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.980]   the size of a shoebox, if you will,
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.600]   that would be a CubeSat.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.940]   - And those, how do those help empower you
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.040]   in terms of doing science, in terms of doing experiments?
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.720]   - Oh, right now, there's, again,
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.640]   back to private industry, Planet, the company,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.960]   is flying CubeSats, and literally looking down on Earth,
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.640]   and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will,
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.600]   of Earth every day, every 24 hours,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.200]   covering the entire Earth, so in terms of Earth observations,
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   in terms of climate change, in terms of our changing Earth,
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.000]   it's revolutionizing, because they're affordable,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.360]   we can put a whole bunch of 'em up,
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   the telecoms, we're all on our cell phones,
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.760]   and we have GPS, we have our telecoms,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.820]   but those used to be very expensive satellites,
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.860]   providing that service, now we can fly
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.580]   a whole bunch of modular CubeSats,
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.460]   so it really is a breakthrough,
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.300]   in terms of modularity, as well as cost reduction.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.380]   - So, that's one exciting set of developments,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.060]   is there something else that you've been excited about,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.580]   like reusable rockets, perhaps,
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.100]   that you've seen in the last few years?
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.220]   - Yeah, well, the reusability,
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.540]   you had, the reusability is awesome,
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.060]   I mean, it's just the best, now we have to remember,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.280]   the shuttle was a reusable vehicle,
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.480]   which, and the shuttle is an amazing,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.320]   it's an aerospace engineer, you know,
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.560]   I mean, the shuttle is still just the most gorgeous,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.400]   elegant, extraordinary design of a space vehicle,
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.320]   it was reusable, it just wasn't affordable,
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.080]   but the reusability of it was really critical,
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.660]   'cause we flew it up, it did come back,
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.640]   so the notion of reusability, I think, absolutely,
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.480]   now what we're doing with, we, you know,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.160]   the global we, but with SpaceX and Vorgent,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.420]   setting the rockets up, recovering the first stages,
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.300]   where if they can regain 70% cost savings, that's huge,
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.900]   and just seeing the control, you know,
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.820]   the control and dynamics, just seeing that rocket
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.260]   come back and land, it never gets old,
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.540]   it's exciting every single time you look at it
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.020]   and say, that's magic, so, it's so cool.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.440]   - To me, the landing is where I stand up,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.460]   start clapping, just the control, yeah.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.780]   - Yeah, just the algorithm, just the control algorithms,
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.580]   and hitting that landing, it's, you know,
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.260]   it's gymnastics for rocket shifts,
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.040]   but to see these guys stick a landing,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.580]   it's just wonderful, so every time,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.340]   like I say, every time I see, you know,
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.400]   the reusability and the rockets coming back
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.760]   and landing so precisely, it's really exciting.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.260]   So it is, it is actually, that's a game changer,
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.080]   we are in a new era of lower costs
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.480]   and a lot, the higher frequency,
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.160]   and it's the world, not just NASA,
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.680]   it's many nations are really upping
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.800]   their frequency of launches.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.660]   - So you've done a lot of exciting research,
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.940]   design engineering on spacesuits.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.100]   What does the spacesuit of the future look like?
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.500]   - Well, if I have anything to say about it,
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.260]   it'll be a very, it'll be a very tight-fitting suit.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.860]   We use mechanical counterpressure
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.060]   to pressurize right directly on the skin.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.860]   Seems that it's technically feasible.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.380]   We're still at the research and development stage,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.700]   we don't have a flight system,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.980]   but technically it's feasible,
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.700]   so we do a lot of work in the materials,
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.380]   you know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone?
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.700]   What's the patterning we need?
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.740]   That's what our patents are in, the patterning,
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.460]   kind of how we apply this, it's a third of an atmosphere.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.220]   - Just to sort of take a little step back,
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.580]   you have this incredible bio suit
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.660]   where it's tight-fitting, so it allows more mobility
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.220]   and so on, so maybe even to take a bigger step back,
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.460]   like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.620]   - Sure, so start from the beginning.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.260]   A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft,
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.460]   so I really, that's the best definition I can give you.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.220]   Right now we fly gas-pressurized suits,
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.220]   but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.
[00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.780]   So then you take all those systems
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.580]   and you shrink 'em around a person,
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.020]   provide 'em with oxygen debris,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.260]   scrub out their carbon dioxide,
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.100]   make sure they have pressure,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.700]   they need a pressure environment to live in.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.020]   So really the spacesuit is a shrunken spacecraft
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.700]   in its entirety, has all the same systems.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.060]   - Communication as well, probably,
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.420]   all that kind of stuff. - Yeah, communications,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.060]   exactly, so you really, thermal control,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.940]   little bit of radiation, not so much radiation protection,
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.980]   but thermal control, humidity, oxygen debris,
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.700]   so all those life support systems
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.620]   as well as the pressure production.
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.500]   So it's an engineering marvel,
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   the spacesuits that have flown,
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.420]   because they really are entire spacecraft,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.020]   they're the smallest spacecraft that we have around a person,
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.740]   but they're very massive,
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.940]   but 140 kilos, the current suit,
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.340]   and they're not mobility suits.
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.020]   So since we're going back to the moon and Mars,
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.460]   we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.660]   So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.620]   I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.220]   and if we can map that motion,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.580]   I wanna give you full flexibility,
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.100]   you know, move your arms and legs.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.640]   I really want you to be like an Olympic athlete,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.460]   an extreme explorer.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.220]   I don't wanna waste any of your energy,
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.100]   so we take it from the human design.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.020]   So I take a look at humans, we measure them, we model them,
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.980]   and then I say, okay, can I put a spacesuit on them
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.180]   that goes from the skin out?
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.420]   So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.780]   that spacecraft around the person,
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.380]   say here's how humans perform,
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.980]   can I design a spacesuit literally from the skin out?
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.620]   And that's what we've come up with,
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.420]   mechanical counterpressure, some patterning,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:49.300]   and that way it could be order of magnitude less
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.020]   in terms of the mass,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.220]   and it should provide maximum mobility.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.580]   For a moon or a Mars.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.100]   - What's mechanical counterpressure?
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.920]   Like how the heck can you even begin
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.040]   to create something that's tight-fitting?
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.580]   - So-- - And still doesn't
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.060]   protect you from the elements and so on,
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.900]   and the whole, the pressure thing?
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.660]   - That's the challenge, it's a big design challenge,
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.780]   we've been working on it for a while.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.340]   So you can either put someone in a balloon,
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.860]   that's one way to do it, that's conventional,
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.700]   that's the only thing we've ever thought.
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.540]   - What's that mean, that means the balloon
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.980]   that you fill with gas? - That's a gas pressurized suit.
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.900]   So put someone in a balloon.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.960]   It's only a third of an atmosphere
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.780]   to keep someone alive, so that's what the current system is,
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.340]   so depending on what units you think,
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.300]   and 30 kilopascals, 4.3 pounds per square inch.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.180]   - So much less than the pressure that's on Earth.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.740]   You can still keep a human alive with .3,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.540]   and it's alive and happy.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.780]   - Alive and happy, and you mix the gases.
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.700]   Do you need, here, we're having this chat,
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.940]   and we're at one sea level in Boston,
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.260]   at one atmosphere, but a suit--
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.420]   - Oxygen and nitrogen.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.300]   - Oxygen and nitrogen, and you put a suit,
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.860]   if we put someone to a third of an atmosphere,
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.500]   so for mechanical counterpressure now,
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.420]   so one way is to do it with a balloon,
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.860]   and that's what we currently have,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.080]   or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.660]   I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.540]   Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere,
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.460]   so if I put that pressure, a third of an atmosphere on you,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.500]   I just have to do it consistently
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.580]   across all of your body and your limbs,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.740]   and it'll be a gas pressurized helmet.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.180]   Doesn't make sense to shrink wrap the head.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.820]   See the blue mangrove, that's a great act,
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.660]   but we don't need to, there's no benefits
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.020]   of shrink wrapping the head.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.120]   You put a gas pressurized helmet,
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.340]   because the helmet then, the future of suits,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.020]   you asked me about, the helmet just becomes
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.660]   your information portal.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.420]   So it will have augmented reality,
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.380]   it'll have all the information you need.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.060]   Should have the maps that I need.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.780]   I'm on the moon, okay, well hey, smart helmet,
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.940]   then show me the map, show me the topography.
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.580]   Hopefully it has the lab embedded too.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.180]   If it has really great cameras,
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:41.620]   maybe I can see with that regolith.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.060]   That's just lunar dust and dirt.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.140]   What's that made out of?
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.460]   We talked about the water.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.540]   So the helmet then really becomes this information portal,
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.980]   is how I see kind of the IT architecture,
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.200]   the helmet is really allowing me to use
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.520]   all of my modalities of an explorer that I'd like to.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.040]   So cameras, voiceover, images.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.760]   If it were really good, it would kind of be,
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.240]   would have lab capabilities as well.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.200]   - Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.480]   comes from the mechanical pressure, which is fascinating.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.880]   Now what aspect, when I look at bio-suit,
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.480]   just the suits you're working on,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.680]   sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.720]   Is that a small part of it too?
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.420]   - Oh, absolutely, 'cause the teams that we work with,
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.460]   of course I'm an engineer, there's engineering students,
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.260]   there's design students, there's architects.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.820]   So it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.420]   So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.940]   all those things we pay attention to.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.920]   So it's not just an engineering solution.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.920]   It really is a much more holistic, it's a suit.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.420]   It's a suit, you're dressed in a suit now.
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.700]   It's a form fitting.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.260]   So we really have to pay attention to all those things.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.460]   And so that's the design team that we work with.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.180]   And my partner, Gaytroti, we're partners in this
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.460]   in terms of he comes from an architecture,
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.100]   industrial design background.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   So bringing those skills to bear as well.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:01.140]   We team up with industry folks who are in
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.020]   athletic performance and designers.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.900]   So it really is a team that brings
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.300]   all those skills together.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.940]   - So what role does the space suit play
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.300]   in our long-term staying in Mars?
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.900]   Sort of exploring the, doing all the work
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.440]   that astronauts do, but also perhaps civilians one day,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.120]   almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.740]   What role does a space suit play there?
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.380]   - So you always need a life support system,
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.100]   pressurized habitat, and I like to say,
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.460]   we're not going to Mars to sit around.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.140]   So you need a suit.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.180]   Even if you land and have the lander,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.740]   you're not going there to stay inside.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:34.580]   That's for darn sure.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.220]   We're going there to search for the evidence of life.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.380]   That's why we're going to Mars.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.060]   So you need a lot of mobility.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.380]   So for me, the suit is the best way
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.900]   to give the human mobility.
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.540]   We're always still gonna need rovers.
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.700]   We're gonna need robots.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.420]   So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.260]   Some people are gonna,
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.840]   some of the suite of explorers are humans,
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.040]   but many are gonna be robots, smart systems,
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:55.880]   things like that.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.500]   But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.140]   make the best exploration team.
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.780]   - So let me ask, I love artificial intelligence,
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:07.620]   and I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.120]   Space Odyssey, 2001, a Space Odyssey.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.540]   Let me ask the question about how 9000,
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.080]   that makes a few decisions there
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.460]   that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.340]   Do you think from a high philosophical question,
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.740]   do you think Hal did the right thing
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.700]   of prioritizing the mission?
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.860]   - I think our artificial intelligence
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.740]   will be smarter in the future.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.220]   For a Mars mission, it's a great question,
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.660]   that is the reality of it.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.400]   For a Mars mission, we need fully autonomous systems.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.700]   We will get humans, but they have to be fully autonomous.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.780]   And that's a really important,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.060]   that's the most important concept
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.060]   because there's not gonna be a mission control on Earth.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.700]   You know, 20 minute time lag,
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.900]   there's just no way you're gonna control it.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:49.940]   So fully autonomous,
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.700]   so people have to be fully autonomous as well,
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.260]   but all of our systems as well.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.420]   And so that's the big design challenge.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.340]   So that's why we test them out on the moon as well.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.780]   When we have a, okay, a few second,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.860]   you know, a three second time lag, you can test them out.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.380]   We have to really get autonomous exploration down.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.900]   You asked me earlier about Magellan.
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.120]   Magellan and his crew, they left, right?
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.220]   They were autonomous.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.180]   You know, they were autonomous.
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.020]   They left and they were on their own
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.100]   to figure out that mission.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.900]   Then when they hit land, they have resources,
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.000]   that's in-situ resource utilization
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.060]   and everything else they brought with them.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.300]   So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   Again, back to the moon, it's more of the testing ground,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.220]   the proving ground with technologies.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.620]   But when we get to Mars, it's so far away
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.620]   that we need fully autonomous systems.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.400]   So I think that's where, again, AI and autonomy come in,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.700]   a really robust autonomy,
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.500]   things that we don't have today yet.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.900]   So they're on the drawing boards,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.340]   but we really need to test them out
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.300]   'cause that's what we're up against.
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.780]   - So fully autonomous, meaning self-sufficient,
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.340]   there's still a role for the human in that picture.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.500]   Do you think there'll be a time when AI systems,
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.380]   beyond doing fully autonomous flight control,
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.780]   will also help or even take mission decisions like Hal did?
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.620]   - That's interesting.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.460]   It depends.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.700]   I mean, they're gonna be designed by humans.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.580]   I think, as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.920]   I mean, we might be on Earth, we might be in orbit on Mars,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.060]   maybe the systems, the landers down on the surface of Mars.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.440]   But I think we're gonna get, we are right now,
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.120]   just on Earth-based systems, AI systems
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.820]   that are incredibly capable and training them
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.660]   with all the data that we have now,
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.760]   petabytes of data from Earth.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.260]   What I care about for the autonomy and AI right now,
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.020]   how we're applying it in research,
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.140]   is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.460]   I mean, that's the, it's not for Mars to me today.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.460]   Right now, AI is to eyes on Earth,
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.620]   all of our space data, compiling that, using supercomputers,
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.860]   because we have so much information and knowledge
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.340]   and we need to get that into people's hands.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.100]   We need, first there's the educational issue with climate
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.460]   and our changing climate.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.820]   Then we need to change human behavior.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:50.660]   That's the biggie.
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.540]   So this next decade, it's urgent we take care
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.620]   of our own spaceship, which is Spaceship Earth.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.360]   So that's, to me, where my focus has been for AI systems,
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.780]   using whatever's out there, kind of imagining also
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.400]   what the future situation is,
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.820]   what's the satellite imagery of Earth of the future.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.500]   If you can hold that in your hands,
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.700]   that's gonna be really powerful.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.180]   Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.620]   and for us to live in balance with Earth?
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.460]   I hope so.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.980]   And kind of start with the ocean systems.
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.480]   So oceans to land to air and kind of using
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.340]   all the space data.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.140]   So it's a huge role for artificial intelligence
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.180]   to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.420]   using the data.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:31.060]   It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.220]   - Do you think, and a weird, dark question,
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.900]   do you think human species can survive
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.220]   if we don't become interplanetary?
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.460]   In the next century or a couple of centuries?
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.900]   - Absolutely we can survive.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.420]   I don't think Mars is option B, actually.
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.180]   So I think it's all about saving Spaceship Earth
[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.300]   and humanity.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.220]   I simply put, Earth doesn't need us,
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.020]   but we really need Earth.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.980]   All of humanity needs to live in balance with Earth,
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.220]   because Earth has been here a long time
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.120]   before we ever showed up,
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.940]   and it'll be here a long time after.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.020]   It's just a matter of how do we wanna live
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.260]   with all living beings, much more in balance,
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.260]   because we need to take care of the Earth,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.740]   and right now we're not.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.780]   So that's the urgency, and I think it is the next decade
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.660]   to try to live much more sustainably,
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.940]   live more in balance with Earth.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.380]   I think the human species has a great,
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.740]   long, optimistic future, but we have to act.
[00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:25.580]   It's urgent.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.220]   We have to change behavior.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.220]   We have to realize that we're all in this together.
[00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.820]   It's just one blue bubble.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.180]   It's for humanity.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.940]   So when I think people realize that we're all astronauts,
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.900]   that's the great news is everyone's gonna be an astronaut.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.740]   - Spaceship Earth.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.180]   - We're all astronauts on Spaceship Earth,
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.500]   and this is our mission.
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.060]   This is our mission to take care of the planet.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.060]   - And yet, as we explore out from our Spaceship Earth here,
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.540]   out into space, what do you think the next 50, 100,
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.900]   200 years look like for space exploration?
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.900]   - I'm optimistic, so I think that we'll have lots of people,
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.460]   thousands of people, tens of thousands of people,
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.200]   who knows, maybe millions, in low-Earth orbit.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.940]   That's just a place that we're gonna have people,
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:11.020]   and actually some industry, manufacturing, things like that.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.560]   That dream, I hope we realize, getting people to the moon,
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.900]   so I can envision a lot of people on the moon.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.100]   Again, it's a great place to go.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.980]   - Living or visiting?
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.860]   - Probably visiting and living, if you want to.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.860]   Most people are gonna wanna come back to Earth, I think,
[00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.620]   but there'll be some people, and it's not such a long--
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.460]   - Good view.
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.020]   - It's a good view, it's a beautiful view.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.700]   So I think that we will have many people
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.540]   on the moon as well.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.340]   I think there'll be some people, you told me,
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:34.900]   wow, hundreds of years out.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.340]   So we'll have people, we'll be interplanetary, for sure,
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.740]   as a species.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.660]   So I think we'll be on the moon, I think we'll be on Mars.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.780]   Venus, no, it's already a runaway greenhouse gas,
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.140]   so not a great place for science.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.860]   Jupiter, all within the solar system,
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.080]   great place for all of our scientific probes.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.260]   I don't see so much in terms of human physical presence.
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.220]   We'll be exploring them.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.620]   So we live in our minds there,
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.260]   because we're exploring them and going on those journeys.
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.980]   But it's really our choice, in terms of our decisions,
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.300]   of how in balance we're gonna be living here on the Earth.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.420]   - When do you think the first woman,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.020]   first person will step on Mars?
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:12.860]   - Step on Mars?
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.540]   Well, I'm gonna do everything I can
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.380]   to make sure it happens in the 2030s.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.220]   - 2030s.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:22.220]   - Say mid-20, you know, 2025, 2035, we'll be on the moon.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.280]   And hopefully with more people than us.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.740]   But first with a few astronauts,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.620]   it'll be global, international folks.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.900]   But we really need those 10 years, I think, on the moon.
[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.500]   And then so by later in the decade, in the 2030s,
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.420]   we'll have all the technology and know-how
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   and we need to get that human mission to Mars done.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.780]   - We'll live in exciting times.
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.820]   And, Deva, thank you so much for leading the way.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.820]   And thank you for talking today.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.220]   I really appreciate it. - Thank you, my pleasure.

[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.860]   that inspires hundreds of thousands of young minds
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.900]   to learn and to dream of engineering our future.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.180]   Thank you and hope to see you next time.
