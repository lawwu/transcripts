[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Today we celebrate the compounded effect of human labor in America. We call it Labor Day.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.360]   Happy Labor Day to everyone out there, in the States at least. In fact, day by day we
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.480]   can invest our lives in what becomes a major enterprise over the years, like in reflecting
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.600]   on the effect of daily habits and disciplines over the course of a whole life. Today's question
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.320]   is from a listener named Kate.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.520]   Hello, Pastor John. I want to start by thanking you for your ministry to the saints. Your
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.600]   podcast has been helpful in my own life concerning Christian living. I've recently been quite
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.520]   intrigued and curious about Christian hedonism, something that you are so passionate about
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.080]   and I have come to believe is beautiful. My question is, what are the little things I
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.460]   can do throughout my busy day to find joy in God, the joy you so clearly know and experience?
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:05.680]   You know, as simple and as practical, even humdrum, as this question sounds, it is one
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.960]   of the most important questions in the world. Maintaining our joy or our satisfaction, our
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.700]   contentment in God is absolutely essential because without it we will be swept away from
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.680]   Christ with affections for other things. If we don't find Christ of supreme value, if
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.800]   he is not our supreme satisfaction, something else will be, and we will be drawn away from
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.780]   the Christian faith. It's not a small thing to ask the question and find the answer, "What
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.660]   are the little things I can do throughout my day to find and preserve my joy in God
[00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.660]   so that I don't find greater joy in other things?" Because our hearts will not rest
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.840]   until they find contentment in something. Our hearts are a desire factory, and if we
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:13.100]   think that we just fall into delight in God or satisfaction in God without any pursuit
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:22.220]   of it or conscious maintenance of that flame, we're kidding ourselves. Our flesh and the
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:33.420]   devil are active all day long to draw us into pleasures that are anti-God. If we have no
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.580]   strategies for awakening and cultivating and preserving and intensifying our joy in God,
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.340]   we will be drawn away by our flesh and the devil into alternative pleasures which are,
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.720]   as Paul said, idolatry. Listen to Colossians 3.5, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:02.100]   in you, sexual immorality, purity, passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is idolatry."
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.900]   Now what's the point of killing, putting to death, killing all that passion and evil
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.140]   desire and covetousness? If you only kill it, what you have is an empty soul. And you
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.540]   remember what Jesus said about an empty soul. What has been driven out will return sevenfold
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.260]   as bad. In other words, the point of killing passion and evil desire and covetousness is
[00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.780]   not so that we would have empty souls with no passions, no desires, no zeal for anything.
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.940]   It's that they may be filled and brimming with alternative passions and alternative
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.300]   desires. Desires for Christ, desires for godliness, desires for nearness to God, desires for all
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.620]   that is good and pure and true and right and lovely and excellent. So Kate's question—I'm
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.820]   saying, "Yes, Kate, way to go!"—so Kate's question is, "What are the little things
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.540]   we can do?" And I'm just going to mention one. Sorry, we can do this again sometime,
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.700]   but I'm going to just mention one thing that became very clear to me even this morning
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.220]   as I was—actually, it was yesterday morning, come to think of it—yesterday morning as
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.220]   I was working in my devotional time to maintain my memorization of 1 Peter. Now I taught 1
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.060]   Peter several years ago and memorized the whole book, all five chapters. I recited it
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.780]   to the class, and since then—that's about three years ago—since then I've tried
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.300]   to say it once a week to not lose the memory of it. But sometimes it needs a concerted
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:54.820]   refreshing. So I was working on chapters 4 and 5 yesterday morning just to make sure
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.980]   I could say those two chapters without stopping and looking at anything. And here's the
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.020]   question that hit me. When I have recited from memory 1 Peter 4 and 5, sitting in my
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:15.620]   chair in my living room, what have I got in my conscious mind for spiritual use—this
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:24.740]   is what Katie is asking about—for spiritual use during the day to help me fight for joy?
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:34.100]   And it hit me again, as it has many times, that I simply do not have the dozens—yes,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:43.780]   dozens—of wonderful faith-strengthening hope-sustaining joy-awakening assurance-preserving
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:52.100]   truths in my conscious mind. They're not there. There are too many. The mind doesn't
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.500]   work like that. At least mind doesn't work like that. And I think I'm average in this.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:09.860]   Those two chapters are simply unconscious to me, or a haze of words, until I make an
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:20.700]   effort to reach back and grasp something with my conscious mind, my memory. Maybe just one
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.580]   phrase emerges. The mind really doesn't work like this. You can tell the mind to go
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.020]   find something on the hard drive of those two chapters. Yes, you can. Even if you don't
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.640]   memorize them, you just read them. You can tell the mind, "Now go back and find something
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.820]   there that you just read." So it's not all blank and a haze. And then the value
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.820]   of memorizing, for me, is that my mind can take that phrase that comes to my mind and
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.580]   put in place the sentences before and after it so that I can properly say it, grasp it,
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.540]   preach it to myself for the sake of my joy. So here's my specific suggestion. Ask yourself
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:11.140]   how your mind works with God's Word. When you are done reading, what do you have present
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:19.700]   and ready for use? My guess is you will have very little present to your consciousness
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:27.540]   and ready for use to fight your spiritual battles and strengthen your joy. Then ask
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:34.180]   yourself, "Okay, what can I do about that?" And one of the things you can do is to pick
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.980]   out from the chapters that you worked on and you pick it out by telling your brain to go
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.340]   find it. And your brain will do that for you. It's amazing. The brain is amazing, amazing,
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.540]   amazing. I'm just amazed at the human brain that you can tell it to do things just like
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.660]   you can tell your hand to do things. Hand, pick up that pencil. Hand, do that. Lips,
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:02.940]   shut up. Stop talking, etc. Or if you have a good memory, you might be able to pick out
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:12.220]   two or three phrases, not just one, two or three verses. Then make those the main message
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:18.460]   you will preach to yourself during the day. Set yourself a reminder on your phone to go
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:27.660]   ding every hour or to vibrate on your wrist to tell you to pull out that sword from your
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:34.420]   morning reading. Say it to yourself. Preach it to yourself. Tell Jesus, "Thank you for
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.620]   it," and that you really believe it. Tell Him you believe it. Tell the devil, tell the
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:44.540]   devil that this blood-bought truth from the Bible—and they're all blood-bought, by the
[00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:50.860]   way, for Christians—tell the devil that this truth is more precious to you than anything
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:58.060]   this devil has to offer. Tell your discouraged soul to be strengthened. Strengthen your knees,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:04.620]   soul. Lift up your hands, soul. This is wonderfully true, soul. Very specifically, what I did
[00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.140]   this morning—this is just by way of example—when I was done with 1 Peter 4 and 5, everything
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:14.860]   was a haze, and hardly anything was conscious to my front-burner brain where I do my battle
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.700]   against joylessness. I reached back, I told my memory, "Now go find something in those
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:27.540]   two chapters." And what my brain found—now this is—I don't know what you call this,
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.460]   spiritual serendipity? It just—boom. Let's call it the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit led
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:40.460]   me to the phrase, "called to his eternal glory in Christ." Those words came to my
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:47.460]   mind. I know where they come from, so I let my memory finish it, and I surrounded them.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.180]   And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to his
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:59.300]   eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. And
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:06.900]   I said to myself, several times to encourage my heart, "God called you, John Piper. He
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:16.780]   called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus. He called you, John Piper. He called
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:24.100]   you, John Piper. He called you to his glory. He called you to his eternal glory." I'm
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:31.180]   squeezing every word like a grapefruit into my spoon at the end of eating it to make every
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:39.200]   good drop of this verse land with tastiness on my soul. It doesn't matter if you have
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.060]   to walk through much suffering, John Piper. Whatever you lose, he's going to restore.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.140]   He's going to confirm. He's going to strengthen. He's going to establish. Get up now. Get
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.300]   up. Get up out of that comfy chair and get to work on APJ, because you're going to record
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:00.620]   tomorrow with Tony. Now be strong. Give yourself wholeheartedly to this work today. Amen. And
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:09.340]   I had a great day preparing for this, as you can tell. I'm loving this. So that's my suggestion.
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:15.940]   Recognize that once you've read a lot of the Bible, most of it is a haze, a muddle in your
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:23.260]   mind. Indeed, it's not even in your conscious mind. You have to tell your mind, like a muscle,
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:28.780]   like you tell your hand to do something. You tell your mind, like a muscle, to go find
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.900]   it. Go find it. Pick it up. Put it before your consciousness. Then you have to tell
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:40.700]   your mind to set it in context so you understand it rightly. And then you have to preach it
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:46.740]   to yourself and against the evil one. This is how you wield the sword of the Spirit and
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:54.660]   slay the demonic temptations to discouragement and feed the fires of joy in Jesus.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.180]   That's really good counsel. Thanks, Pastor John. And listeners, thank you for listening
