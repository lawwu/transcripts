[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.560]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we mix it up and we talk about how to drive your car on wood.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:48.680]   Yes, I mean it like the hard stuff that grows in the form of a tree, literally how to use wood to fuel your car.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:07.080]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.520]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   Indeed, we do mix it up today.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.080]   I don't think this is your standard certified financial planner board of standards content, is it?
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.920]   But I think if it's Radical Personal Finance, not sure how much money is going to save you today.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.640]   But when gas prices increase in the future, who knows?
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.800]   Maybe the content of today's show can save you a few hundred bucks a month.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   Today, I've got Chris Sines and Wayne Keith on from driveonwood.com.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.160]   And I think you can enjoy this interview.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.680]   It's very different as far as the subject matter.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.880]   But it's the kind of stuff that I'm into.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.600]   It was a suggestion from a listener that sent me over a link and I just thought it was a cool topic.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.480]   And I frankly, this interview more than anything else is just me asking some cool guys questions that I thought would be fun.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.600]   And I hope you think it's fun too.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:13.520]   These types of non-traditional, I guess, decisions, I think for a subset of you, not all of you, but for a subset of you, these types of non-traditional topics, I think might open up some doors for you.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.760]   And if you think about it, US Americans spend more on their cars than many other categories of their budgets.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.680]   Now, I would imagine most of you have been enjoying the low gas prices.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.920]   It's been kind of a nice and welcome change to most of our budgets.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.160]   And I'm glad for that.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.720]   But gas prices aren't going to stay low forever.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   And in the future, when they increase, it might be nice to have something like the content of today's show in your back pocket.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.680]   So sit back, relax, and enjoy being introduced to a topic that might someday save you a few hundred bucks a month in fuel costs.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   Chris and Wayne, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.800]   Thanks for having us.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.000]   I've been excited to get you guys on and you were actually a recommendation by a listener.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   And then I went and checked out some of your website and whatnot.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.400]   And I guess, Wayne, I've seen some of your trucks.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:12.080]   I don't remember where it was, whether it was in some kind of Backwoods Home type magazine or my YouTube browsings of weird technology.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.000]   But you've got the fleet of trucks, right?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.400]   A little truck, big truck, and these farm trucks that you're using wood gas systems.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   And I realized, wait a second, I know your work.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.640]   So whatever you're doing, it's good as far as getting popularity out there.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.480]   I'm going to talk today about how to drive your car for free, right?
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.400]   We're going to save people and tell them they never have to buy gasoline again and they're going to be able to drive every mile they want for free.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   Is that an accurate assessment of the opportunity of wood gas?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.080]   Not exactly free.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.920]   We add a little labor in with it.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.720]   It's okay.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.480]   But there's no free lunches.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   Right.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.200]   Hopefully, you heard the tongue in cheek there.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280]   So let's start with a simple introduction.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:04.240]   How is it possible to use wood to power your vehicle and carry you down the road?
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.600]   Okay.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.760]   Proper belief thinks the gasoline engine runs off gasoline.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960]   It doesn't.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   It runs off gasoline vapors.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:22.320]   And in short, we are taking a solid fuel, which is wood, and turning it into vapor and then feeding it to the motor.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.800]   So that's a process called wood gasification, right?
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.200]   Gasification, that's correct.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.160]   We're vaporizing a solid fuel and feeding it to the motor.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.000]   And the motor will run as if it was on LP or natural gas.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   It's being fed on vapor.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.880]   So I'm a total newbie.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   So feel free to correct any technical thing that I get wrong.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.240]   But what is the actual process like?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.400]   If I wanted to bring my car or minivan to you and say, "Guys, could we figure out a
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.080]   way to where I don't need to run this thing on gasoline anymore?"
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.520]   What type of equipment do I need and how do I make that happen?
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.640]   Some vehicles work better with this.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.720]   It has to do with, to start with, you're going to lose some power in relation to gasoline.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.640]   So to start with, we need a big motor because you're going to lose about 25 or 30% of your
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.560]   power.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.360]   And this apparatus called a gasifier, we usually put it in the bed of the truck.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.600]   It takes up some room in the bed of the truck, about what a toolbox will usually take up
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.760]   in the back of the truck.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.560]   The cost on this will depend on how well you are at scavenging around drums, old water
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   heaters, and so forth that can be used to make this gasifier.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.520]   How did you guys get into this as a hobby?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.480]   Okay, let me start first.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.960]   Back in the '70s, during the oil embargo, at the time I was running a little welding
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.920]   shop doing a lot of tinkering.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.160]   I started experimenting with it back in the '70s.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.320]   And then a little while, we could get gas again.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.280]   The price went back down, so I forgot about it for the next 30 years.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.360]   And back about 12 years ago, when gasoline started going up, I drew a line in the sand
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.280]   and said if gasoline ever makes it to the dollar and a half, I'm going to start experimenting
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   with gasification.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.320]   And of course, gasoline did reach that mark.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.640]   And I started experimenting again back in 2003, 2004, and everything just evolved from
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.560]   there.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.840]   I got interested in gasification about seven years ago, I guess.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.620]   I read an article in Mother Earth News, and somebody there had actually built one of these
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.280]   back in the '80s.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.720]   They actually published plans for it in Mother Earth News.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.400]   At the time, I was researching a lot of different alternative energies, reading about solar
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.440]   power and wind power and steam and hydroelectric power and every kind of do-it-yourself off-grid
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.000]   technology because I was just interested in that sort of thing.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.360]   And wood gasification stood out to me as the only thing that I could actually make in my
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   garage.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.280]   You're not going to go out and build yourself a solar panel.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.560]   You're not going to be able to machine a steam engine in your garage.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.040]   It's not something that's within the scope of the average do-it-yourselfer.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.640]   So a gasifier seemed like the easiest thing I could do to get started with this stuff.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.360]   So I was looking around online, and it seemed pretty scattered, the amount of info that
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.840]   was out there about these.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.000]   There was a couple of old articles I found.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.360]   There was occasional references to some guy in Alabama who had some trucks, being Wayne
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.120]   Keith.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   So going on some very limited information, I started building a gasifier.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.480]   I just kind of jumbled it together from a bunch of different designs that I found, and
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.560]   it didn't work very well.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.960]   I mean, I got it finished.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   I did get it to run a truck down the road a little ways, but it was full of mistakes
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.840]   that I could have avoided if I had known any better.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:32.520]   So at some point, it was suggested to me that I go visit Wayne Keith and get a look at some
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   of his trucks.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.880]   And that was four years ago today, actually.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.520]   We were down in Alabama, and he gave me a ride in some of his trucks.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.720]   And I was completely floored.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.080]   I'd never seen anything that worked so well, that was homemade.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.420]   But it actually moved down the road, and it was keeping up with traffic, and it operated
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.240]   perfectly smooth.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.680]   I was very impressed.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.600]   And it wasn't a couple of months later when the two of us ended up starting Drive on Wood.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.480]   And we now have a website where a lot of other people are able to build the same type of
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   system.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.040]   Chris, is this actually something that can save somebody money?
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.600]   Like if somebody wants to actually save money on their driving costs?
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.060]   Oh, definitely.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:32.920]   If you're spending a lot of money on gasoline, it's something you can trade for labor making
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   wood.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.240]   Now, the amount of labor versus the amount of cost is going to depend on what you were
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.520]   being paid in the first place.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.480]   So you might think, Wayne has a good example, if you were thinking of how far you could
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.000]   get on an hour's worth of pay with gasoline.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.320]   Say you were being paid $20 an hour.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.560]   Well, $20 right now will buy you about 10 gallons of gasoline, and that will get you
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.280]   a certain distance, maybe about 200 miles.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.320]   If you can make more wood in that time by processing wood that you have sitting around,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.040]   that you can find in your backyard, if you can spend that same time making wood fuel,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:19.600]   then not only have you done something for yourself and reclaimed that time, but you
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.880]   will probably end up with more time left over because you're not trying to make the money
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.120]   to pay for the gasoline.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.440]   How much wood and time and equipment is actually required to create the wood fuel, and what
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.520]   is the actual fuel that you're creating and using?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   Go ahead, Wayne.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.440]   Let me give you something to think about, Joshua.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:49.680]   I paid for my farm by selling wood at $27 a cord, and that was delivered at the mill,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.520]   which is about a 30-mile round trip.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.640]   So I can assume it was worth even less here on my farm.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.920]   That wood's up a little bit now to probably $50 a cord, but that cord of wood would run
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.880]   my truck 5,000 miles.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   Wow.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:18.520]   Also, I've got a little homemade sawmill that I work with part-time, and I use the
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.880]   slabs or the waste from the sawmill to run my truck.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.360]   A good day of sawing in mediocre timber, I'll have enough waste that I've got to do away
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:37.120]   with, enough that would run my truck to California and back in one day of waste.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.160]   That's remarkable.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.440]   Now there's got to be some labor involved.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.600]   Like I said, there's no free lunches or free rides.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.040]   You've got to have some labor to process this wood.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:59.200]   I made a homemade wood chunker, I call it, and I made it out of junk out of the junkyard,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:06.440]   but I can run these sawmill slabs or sawmill waste through this piece of equipment.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:13.880]   It chops them up into, I guess you could call it, bits of wood about the size of your fist
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.480]   or less, and that's what I feed into the gasifier.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:26.560]   Also, it takes a test we've done, it takes about 16 pounds of wood to carry the truck
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.480]   as far as a gallon of gasoline will.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   Interesting.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.920]   Wayne, tell me about your trucks, because you've built some that are fast and some that
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   haul a lot of weight.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.680]   Tell me about your fleet and what you've been able to accomplish burning this fuel.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.680]   Okay, over the years, I think I've built about 14 or 15 trucks.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.800]   I've also got a tractor now running off the wood.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:58.880]   Built several little gasifiers to run small electric generators and so forth.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:06.840]   For my over-the-road truck or traveling truck, I've got a medium-sized truck, a Dodge Dakota.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.280]   It'll go on down the road pretty good.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:18.440]   I think I've got some videos on YouTube showing running about 95 or so for short distances.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.960]   They run comfortable on the interstate between 60 and 70 miles an hour, but for short distances,
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.120]   you'll even have more speed than that.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.360]   I've also got a work truck.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.760]   It's a V10 Ram Dodge.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.080]   Four-wheel drive is my work truck.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.400]   It's about a 9,000-pound truck, but I use it for farming, pulling trailers, hay trailers,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400]   cattle trailers.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:51.120]   I even haul hay in the bed up next to the gasifier, and it works good.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:59.560]   The best I can figure, I've driven somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 miles now on wood.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:07.760]   I made one cross-country trip that was 7,400 miles strictly on wood.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.720]   Also, I may be one of the few that's ever had speeding tickets on wood, but I'm guilty
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.440]   of a 75 and a 55, shows up each time I have to pay my insurance also.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.400]   The cop wasn't merciful to you after he explained what you were doing?
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.760]   The trooper had no idea that I was using wood.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.800]   The truck just don't stand out that much.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.240]   He don't know that he's probably the only police in the United States that's ever given
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.680]   a wood gas speeding ticket.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:52.120]   If somebody has wood, this sounds like a really cool, they have access to wood.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   It sounds like a really cool thing.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.120]   Yeah, this is not for everybody.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.520]   If you're having to be out looking for wood, it may not fit your lifestyle, but if you've
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.440]   got wood, looking for some way to get rid of the wood, it fits in perfectly.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.320]   It's kind of like a ship captain, sea captain, or whatever that learns his engines run on
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.320]   seawater.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   He's got it made.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.880]   But if you're out in the desert somewhere, that's not going to help you out any.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:29.400]   But if you've got wood, and don't mind getting your hands dirty, it's a cheap ride.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.960]   It's not a free ride, but it's about as cheap a ride as you'll ever find.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.640]   Have you guys seen some significant improvements in the technology, especially you, Wayne,
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:44.120]   after building all these trucks?
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.080]   Are you getting them much better and much more efficient, and do you feel like there
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.720]   is a lot of room to improve still?
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   We would like to.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.480]   Now, we didn't invent the gasification process.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.920]   It's an old process that was used back in World War II.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.340]   We would like to think we have improved it a little bit.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:11.080]   Back in World War II, if you're going down the roads at 35, 40 miles an hour, you might
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.640]   be considered driving fast.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.800]   But nowadays, with these gasifiers, you can get on the interstate highway, stay right
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   with the stream of traffic running 70, 75 miles an hour.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.960]   Nobody even notices you.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:33.680]   Is wood gas superior to things like, I don't know, building a still and creating alcohol
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.400]   fuel?
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.320]   Is it comparable to some of these other alternative sources, or how would you compare it to other
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.760]   fuel options other than gasoline?
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.240]   Go ahead, Chris.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.960]   I think you've studied that more than I.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:57.000]   Like I said before, I've looked into doing a lot of different kinds of homemade fuel,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.240]   trying to figure out the cost and benefit of doing homemade alcohol and homemade steam
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.640]   engines and things like that.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:11.720]   What it turns out is when you go to convert energy from one form into the other, a lot
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.120]   of times you lose most of it along the way.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.960]   For example, if you're going to make ethanol, everybody knows ethanol is more or less a
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.040]   boondoggle.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.240]   But even at home, you can make it, but think of what you've got to do.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:34.160]   You've got to grow a whole bunch of starch crops such as corn, potatoes, etc.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.500]   You've got to harvest all that.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.960]   You've got to ferment it, which you lose a certain amount of energy from that conversion.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.560]   Then you've got to boil it down considerably.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.480]   Once it's been fermented into beer, you've got to ferment it down and concentrate the
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.480]   alcohol.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.280]   That distillation process takes a lot of energy, which is wasted.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's not going into fueling the vehicle.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.360]   It's just going to boil off water.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:10.520]   By the end of the day, the fuel value that you started with is reduced into a very useful
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.840]   but much reduced amount of energy.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.200]   The unique thing about wood gas is that you can actually take a piece of wood that's a
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.160]   very low, it's very raw.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.800]   It hasn't been highly processed.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.540]   As much as we've processed it is to cut it up into little pieces.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.800]   You can directly fuel an engine with it.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.740]   You put it in the gasifier, you get gas out, the gas makes the engine go.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:43.040]   Efficiency-wise, we're talking three or four times as efficient as taking the same wood
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.080]   and putting it through some type of cellulosic ethanol process.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.160]   Not to mention the fact that you can build one of these gasifiers yourself and you don't
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:01.320]   have to have a giant industrial factory to make all these chemical modifications.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   What would be the...
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.320]   Go ahead, Wayne.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   Joshua?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.080]   We did a test at Auburn University on the efficiency.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.720]   We tried the vehicle on gasoline.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:20.360]   A million BTUs of gasoline got us Dodge Dakota 168 miles.
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:28.440]   Then we tried it with a million BTUs of wood and it got the truck 231 miles.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.960]   We analyzed all the wood, sent it to the lab, got the BTU values and et cetera.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:43.000]   Long story short, burning wood in the truck was 37% more efficient than gasoline in the
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   truck was...
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.200]   The engine is designed to run on gasoline.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   So 37% more efficient burning wood scraps, sawmill scraps, than it is gasoline imported
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.720]   across all the way, both sides of the world.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.440]   So are you aware that this is carbon neutral?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.480]   Net carbon neutral.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:15.000]   My friend, Dr. David Bransby at Auburn University says this truck is 67% cleaner than a total
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.960]   electric vehicle if that vehicle is charged on the Alabama grid.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.960]   Wow.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.720]   I love that.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.800]   That's awesome.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.520]   How much volume is...
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:32.920]   Let's say I wanted a million BTUs of wood, I'm going to go 200 and something miles on
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   that.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.160]   How much physical volume of wood chunks would I need to put through the gasifier in order
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.520]   to be able to cover that distance?
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   200 miles, you'd want about almost 200 pounds of wood.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.200]   This Dodge Dakota I'm driving, it gets about a mile and a quarter or a mile and a third
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.600]   per pound of wood.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.960]   So putting that into something like five gallon buckets that I can relate to, how many buckets
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.720]   or barrels of wood is that to go 200 miles?
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.240]   I use sacks, plastic bags.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.960]   I usually have about 15 pounds of wood per bag.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.640]   You can do the math.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.240]   It'll take up...our hoppers, our reservoirs on the gasifier are built to take one of these
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.560]   Dakotas almost 100 miles.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.640]   The best I've done is about 107 miles pulling a small trotter, but assume somewhere around
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   100 miles.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.320]   So you fill up your hopper and then you can carry along a few extra bags of wood with
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.080]   you as you go.
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.840]   Let me jump in here and give you a couple more visualizations.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.980]   A pound of wood is more or less a double handful.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:57.200]   So if you had a bunch of wood chips or wood chunks, if you took about what you can hold
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   in two hands, that's more or less a pound, probably a little more.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.120]   I believe a five gallon bucket will be about 10 pounds.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.260]   I haven't weighed it.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.320]   It's going to depend on the species.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.880]   Some wood is obviously heavier than others.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.020]   You get softwoods and hardwoods.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.820]   So that's why we mostly go by the pound measurement.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.600]   Moisture content is also going to be a factor.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.080]   If you have real wet wood, it's going to take more of that energy to boil the water out.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.060]   So you'll get less energy and you also have more pounds.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.160]   So that kind of screws with your measurements there.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.920]   But if you have dry wood, then it will definitely go about a mile per pound.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   Wayne, when you drove...
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   Josh?
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.920]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.300]   So keep in mind, we don't worry about running out of wood.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.900]   We can switch to gasoline about as fast as you can blink your eye.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.820]   So we don't worry about running out.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.220]   That's not a problem.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.120]   So you just keep a tank of gasoline in the car and then you have a fuel switch where
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.680]   you switch to the tank when you need to?
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:05.200]   I usually keep about a quarter of a tank in the truck just for emergency situations.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.780]   That quarter of a tank might do me months, but I do keep a quarter in there.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.460]   But you don't have to worry about running in.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:19.620]   You just flip the switch and you're back on gasoline just like everybody else.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:25.020]   Wayne, when you drove 7,400 miles across the country, how did you get your hands on the
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.660]   wood that you needed to put in your car?
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:34.060]   Had several sponsors going out there and back.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.140]   I had some partners that went with me.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:44.380]   They had called ahead to places like furniture shops and so forth that had waste.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.820]   We would stop along the way and hit their dumpsters.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.900]   I know we stopped in, I believe it was Lubbock, Texas, and hit one of their dumpsters.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.220]   I think they built cabinets or something like that.
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.980]   Just one dumpster would have fueled us all the way out there and back.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:08.260]   We just got one out of five that had parked there.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.140]   That's cool.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:16.220]   For people who are traveling, years ago I ran across some of these people who burn waste
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:20.260]   veggie oil in their buses or RVs or things.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:27.580]   I found this group of guys who had bought a Japanese fire engine, diesel-running fire
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:33.460]   engine, converted it to run on waste vegetable oil, and traveled from at least Alaska to
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.540]   Panama if not down through South America.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.820]   I don't remember, and I don't remember the name of the blog, but did the entire trip
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.040]   on waste vegetable oil.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.100]   They burned French fry oil in the United States.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.340]   They burned palm oil in Central America.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.900]   It's such a cool concept.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:54.100]   Obviously a lot of work, but such a cool concept to be able to take waste products and turn
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.540]   them into something useful.
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.100]   The ability to move your vehicle across the country.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   It's amazing.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.100]   Right.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:10.540]   At one time, I think that process worked pretty good, but I think a lot of your restaurants
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:16.740]   and so forth that had that oil, they've learned that it's a commodity now and it's a lot harder
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.740]   to find it.
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.980]   I know people around here that once did the cooking oil deal, but they pretty much had
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980]   to stop that.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:29.260]   But wood's about the same price it's ever been, maybe cheaper now.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:33.820]   I was going to say, we found an inefficient market with lots of wood scraps available.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820]   Couple more questions.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.760]   How does it actually work?
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.220]   As far as what does a wood gasifier do and how does it work?
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.980]   What does it look like inside of it and how do you get wood into the engine?
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:49.060]   Let me give you the short version here.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:54.580]   When you burn biomass in an oxygen-restricted environment, the products are going to be
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.900]   carbon dioxide and water vapor.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:05.140]   Now, if you heat these products up to somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 degrees and run them
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.940]   through red-hot charcoal, you'll get a thermochemical reaction, which will turn these products into
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.980]   hydrogen, CO, and methane.
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.820]   It's the gas that runs the motor.
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:27.140]   To really understand what's going on, you'd probably need chemistry how the charcoal will
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:34.900]   strip oxygen atoms from the CO2 and the H2O.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.740]   Chris can probably explain the science behind it better than I can.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.700]   I just know how to make them run.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:46.900]   I don't claim to know all the science behind them.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.100]   Let me run one more of these visualizations by you.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.140]   If you just took a big old knife and you sliced a gasifier right down the center so you can
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.740]   see a cross-section of it, at the very top you'd have a lid.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:04.700]   For about the first half of it, you'll have what we call a hopper.
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.460]   That's where the wood sits that hasn't been burned up yet.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.020]   That's what you refill when it gets low.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:15.380]   As long as you keep putting wood in there, it'll run indefinitely.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.500]   About the halfway point is where it will start converting into charcoal.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.100]   You'll have some wood that's partly burnt, and then below that you'll have wood that's
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.140]   completely converted into charcoal.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.020]   The charcoal is what does all the hard work.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:39.140]   It gets hot, and as it heats up the wood above it, the wood releases vapors.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.660]   They're called pyrolysis gases.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:48.380]   The gases are consumed by the incoming oxygen from the nozzles.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:56.100]   You've actually burned up all of those initial gases, and you created carbon dioxide, and
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.980]   you got some water vapor.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.780]   You take those gases and you put them through this hot charcoal bed.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.980]   As they go through the hot charcoal bed, like Wayne was saying, the carbon reacts with the
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:15.900]   water vapor and the carbon dioxide, and you get carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas and a
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.360]   little bit of methane.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.800]   Those are all flammable gases.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.660]   That process continues all the way through the charcoal until it comes out the bottom.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.700]   At the very bottom of the gasifier, you've got a grate, which is just a flat plate with
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   some holes in it to let the little bits of charcoal and dust fall through.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.740]   Then the gas will come back up around the side and then go out to the filtration and
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.740]   the cooling and on into the motor.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:53.020]   Mad Fientist: Can you build a generator that runs off of wood gas to power something like
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.180]   an off-grid generator situation to charge the battery bank for your house?
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.940]   Wayne Henson: Certainly.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.140]   Mad Fientist: Is it economical and efficient to do that?
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:09.020]   Wayne Henson: I would say it's actually an even better use for somebody who's in
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.860]   that situation that's got a lot of wood.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.940]   If you're already heating your house with wood, for example, it would be a perfect fit
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.940]   for a rural type situation.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:24.220]   You're going to need a fair amount of wood if you want to make a lot of electricity.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.900]   For every gallon of gas that you would've burned in that generator, you've got to
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.020]   come up with 16 pounds of fuel wood.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:41.900]   This is not going to power your high electricity demand, yuppie lifestyle with lots of high
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.980]   electric home heating and electric dryers and electric this and that.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.700]   You're going to have to tone it down a little bit.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.460]   But the type of person who would be doing that is already looking at that from solar
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.540]   and wind power.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:58.220]   So if you're already reducing your electrical needs, then it'll be a great fit.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:05.300]   It's definitely good for a secondary generator to go along with a solar setup or primary
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.500]   use.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.540]   If you've got a decent battery bank, you should have no trouble with that.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:17.860]   Joshua, I failed to mention when we made our cross country trip, took a little electric
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:23.460]   generator, electric power tools, saws and so forth.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:29.780]   We would stop and gather wood, if we find dead or dry wood along the way.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.260]   We had this generator hooked up to the truck gasifier.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:38.980]   We would run the generator to run the power tools to process your wood to go on our way.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.700]   I've been all the way across the United States.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:47.580]   I couldn't take everybody for a ride, but we would stop and hook this generator up to
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.860]   the truck.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.940]   The generator didn't have a gas tank on it.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:58.340]   I'd remove the gas tank to show them the generator was running off of wood to do these chores,
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.980]   run the power tools, et cetera.
[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.940]   Also on our website, we have a lot of folks that live off grid, and they're using this
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:13.580]   process using the gasification to run the generator to keep batteries charged and et
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.140]   cetera.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:22.220]   Mad Fientist: With somebody who has average capabilities, and they're working with some
[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.540]   of your good plans, and they have average fabrication capabilities, and they want to
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:33.300]   build a unit to power a Dodge Dakota, an older Dakota, what kind of guesses do you have as
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.980]   far as how much the parts cost and how much time is going to be required to build something
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.940]   that can power a small pickup truck?
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:52.100]   Tom Hickson: The best we can figure, labor-wise, if you make it look real nice, it's labor-intensive.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:58.220]   It takes me 250 hours to build one, but the trucks look nice.
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.620]   I can park in Walmart's parking lot and never get eyebrow-raised out there.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   They just don't notice.
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.180]   They just blend in with them, but it takes me 250 hours to build one.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:18.180]   As far as materials, if you can look out for salvage yards and so forth to get your materials,
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:23.860]   you can come up with $500 or near that.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.620]   If you're having to buy them on retail and so forth, you can look closer to $1,000.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:36.900]   I'm guessing somewhere between $500 and $1,000 for material and 250 hours for your labor.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.620]   Tom Hickson Wayne, how old are you?
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.260]   Wayne Hines I'm 67.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.540]   Tom Hickson Are you thinking about retiring, or is this going to be something you're going
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.540]   to keep doing?
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.620]   Wayne Hines I'll keep doing it as long as I can.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.500]   It's nice to tell folks that I've got enough motor fuel to do the rest of my life, but
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.060]   that's the situation I'm in right now.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.580]   The amount of wood I've got piled up.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.220]   Tom Hickson That's awesome.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.140]   Chris, how about you?
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.460]   What are your plans for this project, this new website and things like that?
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.220]   Do you have anything specific, or are you just trying to promote an enthusiast's community
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.460]   so that the technology can be advanced?
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.620]   Chris Steele Well, certainly that.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.620]   I have some ideas.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.180]   I'd like to start building some of these smaller generator style units and see if people are
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.900]   interested in those.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.740]   We've built plenty of trucks now, so those are out there.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:40.260]   People can probably find those used, but the Keith style gasifier hasn't been done to a
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.820]   small generator very often.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.460]   Just building a small one geared towards that.
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.620]   So I'm going to explore that a little bit.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.620]   We'll continue to do the website.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.580]   We've got a pretty sizable community where people have been passing notes back and forth
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:03.140]   about how their experiences have been, what modifications they've come up with, and all
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.220]   sorts of interesting new ideas and techniques.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.260]   There's a lot of good community at the website now.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.260]   Tom Hickson Awesome.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.900]   So the website is driveonwood.com.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.500]   We have some information there.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.340]   There's plenty of things on YouTube.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:23.300]   Anywhere else that you'd like people to check out your work or anything that you'd like
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:29.020]   to for people who are just having an introduction to the idea of wood gas?
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.460]   Is there anything else you'd like to share with the listening audience?
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.500]   Chris Steele There's a lot on YouTube.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.380]   They can just punch Wayne Keith YouTube.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.020]   I've got a lot of videos showing me working.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:51.900]   I've got a farm tractor that runs off of wood, and I've had several trucks showing them going
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:58.260]   down the road, cross-country, doing farm work, and et cetera.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:01.380]   Tom Hickson Chris, how about you?
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.620]   Anything else that you'd like people to know about?
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:09.500]   Chris Steele I think we've got pretty much everything that
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.020]   we can come up with related to wood gas.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.140]   I've put a lot of information into the library section.
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.740]   So if you go on the website and you click on library, that'll take you.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:26.020]   There's a lot of PDFs of the research that's been done and information about pretty much
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.820]   as detailed as you want to get.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.340]   It's all there.
[00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:37.660]   But if your listeners are interested in checking this out, we encourage everybody to sign up
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.140]   on the forum, make a couple of posts, ask some questions, do some reading, and you'll
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.860]   find a lot of very knowledgeable people that are willing to help you out.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:36:03.540]   Tom Hickson Gentlemen, thanks for coming on the show.
