[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.220]   Well, 2019 remains busy for you, Pastor John, and two weeks from now, you and Noel will
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.320]   be in South America, Lord willing, in Brazil and Argentina.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.560]   You'll speak at some key events in the St. Paul of Brazil in Sao Paulo, and then down
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720]   to Buenos Aires, and then back up in Brazil to Campina Grande.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.640]   And I know a lot of APJ listeners have emailed us, eagerly awaiting your arrival in each
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.260]   of these three cities, and I know you're excited to go on this trip as well.
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.800]   You've spoken in Brazil before, correct?
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.600]   I've been to Brazil a couple times.
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.980]   I've never been to Argentina.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.760]   My excitement about going to Brazil is because I know people there, and I love what I know.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.640]   I love the spirit, I love the hunger, and I'm eager to build on our time together with
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.600]   the precious truths that we share.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.760]   I don't know the new friends that I anticipate making in Argentina.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.540]   This has me and my wife excited.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.160]   She loves to put another notch in the gun of her travels.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.800]   She's way more of a traveler than I am, and she's never been to Argentina, and I've never
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:29.080]   been, and so we're eager to discover, not just build, but discover the temperament,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   the tone, the hunger, the zeal, faithfulness of our friends in Argentina.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.440]   So that feels like kind of a new venture for us, and I'm so eager to see.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.280]   I'm praying right now in my season of preparation, "What, Lord, do you want me to bring to Brazil
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.920]   and to Argentina?"
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.920]   And if folks hear this while I'm still working on it, they can pray, "Oh, God, give Pastor
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.120]   John something thatâ€”where he doesn't know us very well, something that we need and he
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   will receive from the Lord."
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.480]   So I'm excited.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.520]   I'm excited to build.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160]   I'm excited to discover.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.160]   Amen.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.720]   I cannot wait to see what the Lord does on this trip.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.200]   That Campina Grande event alone, get this, it's a massive Bible conference that has replaced
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.800]   Carnival, which was a huge Mardi Gras-like cultural event in the city.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.880]   That is now a city festival devoted to Reformed preaching and teaching, 50 teachers, seven
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.160]   nights, 100,000 people, food and books in huge tents.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.000]   I cannot wait to get an update on that event, Pastor John.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.200]   It's worth giving a special thanks to our friend Rick Denham, who plays such a huge
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.760]   role in our international work, and Fiel, not to mention Soldados de Jesucristo, based
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   in Argentina, who has prepared for your trip by releasing the Solid Joys devotional into
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   Spanish with audio.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   Amazing amount of work.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.000]   There are already a lot of precious friends to us in South America.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.920]   And so I'm looking forward to hearing what happens on that trip, Pastor John.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240]   And speaking of Brazil, here's today's question.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.360]   "Hello, Pastor John, my name is Julio17 and I live in Brazil.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.600]   I look forward to seeing you very soon.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.480]   I was listening to the episode where you addressed the question of when does Bible neglect become
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.960]   sinful, and the question appeared to me in my own mind.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.360]   My question is this.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.400]   In the world we live in today, is it a sin to claim time for other things other than
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.360]   reading the Bible or praying?
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.320]   Things such as watching a movie or playing a game are very enjoyable to me, but I wonder
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.560]   if God is disappointed in me for using some of my free time to do these things instead
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.360]   of claiming time for Him.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.980]   I read the Bible and pray every day and go to church almost every week, but it sometimes
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.360]   feels wrong to do anything that isn't directly connected to the Lord.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.600]   Pastor John, how do you think about these things?"
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.240]   Jesus told a parable that went like this.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.360]   It may sound a little disconnected at first, but give me time.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, "What shall I do,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   for I have nowhere to store my crops?"
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.760]   And he said, "I'll do this.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   I'll tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I'll store all my grain and my goods,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.920]   and I will say to my soul, 'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.280]   Relax, eat, drink, be merry.'"
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   God said to him, "Fool, this night your soul is required of you, and the things you have
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.320]   prepared, whose are they going to be?
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.040]   So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God."
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.560]   That's Luke 12, 16 to 21.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:59.680]   Now I start here with this parable because I want to commend Julio for his struggle.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.240]   The man in this parable had no struggle at all.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.240]   He earned it.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   He earned it.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240]   He owned it.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   He stored it.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.840]   He had security.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.920]   He would play, play, play.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.800]   And Jesus said, "Fool."
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.040]   He was about to lose his soul.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.600]   Most people in the prosperous West, whether Brazil or America, are falling into the ditch
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:33.120]   on that side of the road that's not too self-denying, not too ascetic.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.840]   But Julio is struggling in the other direction.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.760]   He needs help in the other direction.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.160]   What kind of eating, what kind of drinking, what kind of being merry could be godly?
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.200]   And so his first question is this, "Is it a sin to claim time for other things other
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.520]   than reading the Bible or praying?"
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.080]   And the answer, of course, it's not a sin.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.280]   And the reason you know it's not necessarily a sin, I mean, of course, you can make things
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.120]   an idol, is because Paul told us to work for a living, Ephesians 4, 28, which for most
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   people around the world has always involved eight to 12 hours a day doing things with
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.560]   their hands or feet or backs or brains that are not simply Bible reading and prayer.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.320]   And that's commanded of us.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.960]   And Jesus said to His disciples, "After a hard season of work, come apart and rest a
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.760]   while," Mark 6, 31.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:40.680]   Now, we don't know what they did, but it was a break from more intense ministry of the
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   Word.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.920]   Break, take a break from that.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.440]   And Paul told believers how they should act when they accept a dinner invitation from
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.900]   unbelievers, 1 Corinthians 10, 27.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:07:01.140]   So he assumed they had simple, friendly relations with others and joined in ordinary times of
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.620]   relaxed togetherness.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.620]   So those are some of the reasons I say, no, no, it's not a sin to take time away from
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:16.380]   Bible reading and praying and do what appear to be more ordinary things that the world
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.980]   does, working, resting, going to dinner, and so on.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.900]   It's not a sin.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:30.980]   But then Julio says, "But I wonder if God is disappointed in me for using some of my
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:37.680]   free time to do entertaining things instead of claiming time for Him.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.340]   It sometimes feels wrong to do anything that isn't directly connected to the Lord."
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:53.540]   So here's my main encouragement to Julio and the rest of us, seek to bring every act
[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.900]   into connection with the Lord.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:04.180]   And the more difficult that is, the more likely it is that the act should be replaced with
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.220]   something more fruitful.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.140]   In other words, put everything through this grid.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.940]   I'll give you three Bible verses, 1 Corinthians 10:31, "Whether you eat or drink, whatever
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.740]   you do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.580]   So that's what I mean by bringing every act into connection with the Lord.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:31.300]   Or Colossians 3:17, "Whatever you do, whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.840]   name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.380]   So bring everything into connection to the name of the Lord Jesus.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:49.700]   Or 1 Corinthians 16:14, "Let all that you do be done in love."
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:58.340]   So three tests, three ways to connect everything to Jesus, all for His glory, all in the name
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.120]   of Jesus, all in the cause of loving others.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:12.700]   And stir into this sifting of behaviors 1 Timothy 6:17, "As for the rich in this present
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.100]   age," now I would say that if you can play a video game, you're rich.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.980]   You got something to play it on.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.980]   You're not starving.
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:28.500]   Charge them, charge John Piper and Julio, charge them not to be haughty, not to set
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:35.980]   their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.620]   to enjoy.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.700]   And 1 Timothy 4, 5 says how?
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.540]   And it's talking about sex and food, very ordinary things that everybody participates
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.340]   in either legitimately or illegitimately.
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.180]   "For everything created by God is good.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.780]   Everything is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.980]   the Word of God in prayer," 1 Timothy 4, 4, and 5.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:13.500]   In other words, Paul assumes that there is a way, a necessary way, for Christians to
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:23.280]   transpose the enjoyments of good things in this world, God-given good gifts, transpose
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:34.060]   the enjoyments of them into worshipful acts that are holy and Christ-honoring and people-loving.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.340]   Those very acts of food and sex make music.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:45.300]   You transpose that music into Christ-honoring music by the Word of God in prayer, by bringing
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.580]   them into connection with the glory of God and the name of Jesus and love for people.
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:57.780]   In other words, he does not assume that the handling of the good gifts of this world,
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:04.940]   which could be idols, will necessarily be idols but will become, in fact, avenues of
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:11.700]   knowing God better and enjoying Him more and being a greater blessing to other people.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.740]   Joe Rigney has written an important book about this called Things of Earth, the whole book
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:25.300]   devoted to trying to help us come to terms with how you bring good things into connection
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:30.620]   with the Lord without despising them or turning them into idols.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.500]   So here's my bottom-line counsel to all of us.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:43.060]   Seek to bring every act into connection with the Lord, every entertainment, as a gift from
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:49.340]   God and a revelation of Himself and a path of worshipful enjoyment and good for other
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.260]   people, seek to bring every act into connection with the Lord.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:12:01.780]   And the more difficult that is, that is, this act doesn't really fit with the Lord so well,
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.900]   the more difficult it is, the more likely it is that the act should be replaced with
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.260]   something more fruitful.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.500]   That's really good, Pastor John.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   Thank you.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.940]   So what would Pastor John say to someone who is so addicted to entertainment that they
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.420]   cannot break free of it?
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.620]   That question is an important follow-up, and it's next time when we return on Monday.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.620]   Until then, please be praying for Pastor John as he prepares for this upcoming international
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.620]   trip.
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.020]   I am Tony Reinke, your host.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.580]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor, John
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   Piper.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   We'll see you next time.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.060]   1
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.060]   1
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:56.060]   1
