[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   In the following sermon given on Sunday morning the 15th of March 1959 in the Westminster Chapel, London,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from the text to be found in the book of Joshua, chapter 4, verses 21 to 24,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and is a continuation of his series of sermons on revival. The theme, "What mean these stones?"
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Now, we are considering this incident in the history and the story of the children of Israel
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   because it seems to us to provide us with a very perfect parallel to something that is happening this present year.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I'm referring to the whole question of revival and to the attention which is being drawn by means of books and articles and meetings
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   to the fact that a hundred years ago in 1858 and 1859 there was a great revival of religion,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   a great movement of the Spirit of God in various countries like the United States of America
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and Northern Ireland and Wales and Scotland and Sweden and in a lesser form in various other places.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And here I say in this incident, in this book of Joshua, it seems to me we have a very perfect parallel.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And I call attention to it because the teaching in connection with this incident
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   does remind us of the way in which we should approach this whole question of revival today.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Here it is, you remember, God commended these children of Israel to take up twelve stones
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   from the middle of the river of Jordan where the priests had been standing while the people were passing over.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He'd commended them to take these twelve stones and to set them up as a memorial outside the city of Gilgal
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   with this intention that when future generations should happen to see this memorial, these stones,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   they should be provoked to ask the question, "What mean these stones?"
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And then the authorities would be able to reply saying, "These are here to commemorate
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   that amazing thing which God did when he brought your forefathers through the river of Jordan on dry land,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   even as he had done when he brought them through the Red Sea on dry land."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well now then, it's in that way we are using this incident.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   We feel that we are confronted by these various things that are being done at the present time
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and that these are compelling us to ask, "Well, what is this about?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   What are these books on the 59 Revival and others?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   What are they telling us? What is this thing that is being commemorated and brought back to memory?"
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And we are answering that question in terms of what we are told here,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   because God's methods are always the same. The principles on which God acts never vary.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So we have seen that first and foremost we are called upon to look at certain facts,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   something that has literally happened.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We are really dealing with history.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It is simply a fact of history, recorded by the newspapers at the time,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   and they are still available for inspection,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   that something was happening in these various countries that became front page news.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Even the newspapers became interested.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was the main matter of interest and the main topic of conversation.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Facts.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And then we've gone on to consider the nature of these facts.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And there we have seen that the vital thing was that it is the hand of the Lord,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   a miracle, an unusual happening.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   God, who normally deals with us in an immediate manner, doing something immediately,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   manifesting himself in a most exceptional and unusual way,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   the miraculous element in connection with it all.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And that is what we were considering together last Sunday morning.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The significance of the facts, therefore,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   as being a manifestation of God's almighty and miraculous power.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's put here very graphically,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And we worked that out together.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Well, now this morning we proceed to another aspect of it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   What is the object and the purpose of all this?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   There it is, this thing that happened, its miraculous character.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   But why, why did it happen?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   What is the object, what is the purpose?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Or if I may put my question in a different way, and ask with reverence,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   why does God do this from time to time?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Because we've been reminding one another that what happened a hundred years ago
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   is but one in a series of similar events.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   From time to time in the long history of the church,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   there have been these visitations, these outpourings of God's Spirit.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Nothing is clearer in the history of the church than that.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   That does indeed seem to be the history of the church.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   She starts in a great outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   That persisted for some time, but then it began to wane and to vanish.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And the church got into a powerless condition.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Some people thought the end had come.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Suddenly God pours out His Spirit again,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and the church is raised up to the heights once more.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   That persists, but gradually passes.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And so the history of the church is a sort of graph of up and down and up and down.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   That has been happening throughout the running centuries.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Now the question we are concerned with this morning is,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   why does God do this from time to time?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And the answer is given to us very perfectly in these verses that we are looking at together.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   You notice the first reason given in that last verse is this,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   "That, in order that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Now this is therefore the first reason that is given.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   God does this thing from time to time.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   God sends revival blessing upon the church,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   in order that he may do something with respect to those that are outside even.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   He is doing something that is going to arrest the attention of all the people of the earth.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Here is, we must always realize, the first reason for ever considering this matter at all.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   This is the main reason, the chief reason.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   This is my main reason for calling attention to this whole subject of revival,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and for urging everybody to pray for revival and to look for revival and to long for revival.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   This is the reason, the glory of God.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   You see, Israel alone represented God and his glory.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   All the other nations of the world were pagan, they had their various gods,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and they didn't believe in and worship the God of Israel.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   But God had chosen these people, he'd made a nation for himself,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   in order that through them and by means of them, he might manifest his own glory,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and bear this testimony to all the nations of the world.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   That was the real function of the children of Israel,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and the other nations were watching them.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And they were tempted always to scoff at them and to ridicule them.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Whenever the nation of Israel was defeated or seemed to be helpless or was in trouble,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   the other nations would always say, "Where is their God,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   the God of whom they've spoken so much and of whom they've boasted so much?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Where is he? Where is his power?"
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Very well, the first reason for this action, therefore, is
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   that all these peoples and nations may know the hand of the Lord,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that it is mighty.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   God is vindicating himself.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   God is asserting his own glory and his own power.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   God is doing this, I say, in order that those on the outside
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   who may scoff and speak in derision
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   may see something that will pull them up and arrest them,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   and astound them.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Now, let us never lose sight of this.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   This is the main reason for being concerned about revival.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We shouldn't seek revival in order that we may have experiences.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I've been describing to you experiences that do take place in revival,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   but we don't seek revival primarily for that reason.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   There are people who do, of course.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   There are people who always rush to meetings where any kind of experience is promised,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   and they go around from one to the other, people who are just itching and thirsting
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   to have experiences, always thinking of themselves.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But that's not the way in which it's put here.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   That is the way in which it should never happen,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   because the primary thing is the glory of God, and the power of God,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and the name of God, and the honor of God.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So let us be perfectly clear about that.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   There are people who are ready to jump at anything that will solve their problem
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   or the problem of the church.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You see, a few years ago, the main sections of the Christian church
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   were not interested at all in evangelism.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   They despised it and dismissed it with derision.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   But every section of the church today is talking a great deal about evangelism.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Why? Well, simply because they're seeing their churches becoming empty.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And they'll take up anything that will help to solve them the problem of church attendance
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   or church finance even.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And they will do likewise undoubtedly with respect to revival.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   But that is a terrible thing to do.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   No, no, our overriding, controlling reason for having any interest at all in these matters
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   should be the glory of God.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Does it grieve you, my friends, that the name of God is being taken in vain and desecrated?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Does it grieve you that we are living in a godless age
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and when men have sufficient arrogance to speak in public and in private
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   with sarcasm about this book with its record of God's mighty deeds and actions?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Well, we are living in such an age, and the main reason why we should be praying about revival is this,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   that we are anxious to see God's name vindicated, God's glory manifested.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   We should be anxious to see something happening that will arrest the nations,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   all the peoples, and cause them to stop and to think again.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Well, here I say is the first thing.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   You'll find this constantly in the scriptures.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It is in many ways one of the leading themes, if not the leading theme, in the book of the Psalms.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   You read your Psalms and watch those men praying for a visitation of God's Spirit,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and every time this is their reason, that these heathen who are scoffing may be silenced.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And the psalmist cries out that God should do something that should silence them.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   This is the end to which they're always looking,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   that God will do something and speak in such a way as to say to everybody,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   "Be still and know that I am God."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   That's the great theme of that 46th Psalm,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   which we were singing together in that metrical manner just now.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   The nations and their princes are all being addressed.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   These people who are arguing against God and querying whether there is such a God.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And listen, says the psalmist, here's the God who makes wars to cease.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   This is the God who arises and vindicates himself, and then having displayed his case,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   he says, "Be still, give up, give in, admit that I am God."
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Now that is the thing of which we are reminded here.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   God himself told Joshua to tell the people that he was doing this for that reason primarily,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   that he might thus manifest his glory and silence the people who are outside.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And that is what revival has invariably achieved.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It has caused those who are outside the church
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   and those who are inimical to Christianity to pay attention.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You see, it's a phenomenon.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   It is, as we were agreeing last Sunday, something miraculous.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   It's something that astounds them and causes them of necessity to stop and to look and to consider.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Now, their reason for stopping and considering may not be a good one.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It may be sheer curiosity, but it doesn't matter what it is.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It does make them stop and think.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Now, you've got a classical example of all this, of course, in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   That's what happened on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was poured out.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And you will read that the people of Jerusalem and all the strangers who were there
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   gathered together and said, "What is this?"
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   They were arrested.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   They said, "What is this?" A phenomenon, something had happened,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and they were forced to pay attention.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And Peter had to get up and give his explanation, you remember.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Well, now, that is always what a revival does.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   And the point I'm trying to establish is this,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   that there is nothing short of a revival that will have that effect.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   We've tried nearly everything else, but it doesn't succeed.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   The masses of the people, even if they show a temporary interest, show no more than that.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   No, no, man can never do anything that will have this effect.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   This is always the action of God, if I may put it bluntly and plainly and clearly.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   What is needed is not a stunt,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   but the action of God that will stun people.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   That's the difference.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Man can produce stunts, and he's very clever at doing that.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   He can think of something fresh and new, and he'll advertise it.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   But the people know the whole time it's men doing it.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's a stunt, they say.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   No, no, stunts will never lead to this desired position.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   But when God arises and when God acts,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   well, then something's happening, I say, that men are forced to pay attention to.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They can't understand it, they can't explain it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Your psychologists are left without any explanation.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   They can explain stunts all right, but they can't explain this.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   That is the difference, you see, between men organizing something
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and God manifesting the right hand of his power and showing that it is mighty.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Well, what I want to put to you as an argument is this.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Is there anybody who still needs to be convinced
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   that this is the crying need of the hour?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   We are aware of the position of the vast majority of the people of this country.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You and I were here this morning constitute but 5% of the population of this country.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   And though we may preach and fast and sweat and pray and do all we can,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   all our efforts seem to lead to nothing.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Cannot you see, my dear friend, that what is needed is some mighty demonstration of the power of God,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   some enactment of the Almighty,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   that will compel people to pay attention and to look and to listen?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And the history of all the revivals of the past indicates so clearly
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   that that is the effect of revival invariably and without any exception at all.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   That is why I am calling attention to revival.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   That is why I am urging you to pray for this.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   When God acts, he can do more in a minute than men with his organizing can do in 50 years.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Let us realize this tremendous possibility, therefore,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   and plead to God to make known his power and to manifest his glory
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation of people
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   that even blaspheme his holy name and deny his very existence.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   For God's sake, for the glory of his name,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   let us intercede and pray for a visitation of God's Spirit.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Well, there is the first great reason,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   But there is a second reason.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And the second reason is this, that you might fear the Lord your God forever.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This is the thing I have been emphasizing,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   that revival is of great value to the church as well as all it does for the world.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   That you might know, that you might fear the Lord your God forever.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Now then, what does it do for the church?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Let me enumerate some of the things that are taught here quite plainly.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   The first thing it does is to give the church an unusual consciousness
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   of the presence and the power of God.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   That you, the children of Israel, might fear the Lord.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   Now, in the tenth verse of the previous chapter, the third chapter,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   it is put much more explicitly and powerfully.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Listen.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   That's it.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   This is going to happen, said Joshua, to the people,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   in order that you may know that the living God is among you.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Ah, you read this story of the children of Israel,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   and you'll see very clearly that they needed to be reminded of that.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Though they were God's people, though he had done so many things for them and to them,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   though he'd brought them out of Egypt, though he'd brought them through the Red Sea,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   though he'd led them in the wilderness and their feet didn't swell,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and they never lacked food because he fed them with manna bred from heaven,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   yet they were constantly fearful and grumbling,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   looking at the other nations and peoples and their gods, and hesitant and doubtful.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Oh, they behave in the manner which makes us feel that they're people
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   who didn't realize their relationship to God.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And God did this thing at the river of Jordan
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   in order that they might know that the living God was among them.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Now, this is the supreme need of the church today.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   If you were to ask me to state in one form the main trouble with the Christian church as she is at this moment,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   the main trouble with every one of us in our daily life and living,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I shouldn't hesitate to say that it is this.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   We fail to realize that the living God is among us.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   What is the church?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Well, the church is this institution, this body in which God dwells.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   He's promised that.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   "I will be in you, I will dwell in you, I will walk among you."
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   That's what he says.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   That is what he said to these children of Israel.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   That is what is transferred in exactly the same way to the Christian church.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   The Christian church is not a human organization and institution.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   She is, as the apostle Paul puts it at the end of the second chapter of the epistle to the Ephesians,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   she is a great building in which God dwells, an habitation of God.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   "I will be in you, I will dwell in you, I will walk among you."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Now, that's an argument that's worked out in many places in the New Testament epistles.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   But you see, the church doesn't seem to realize that today.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   People will persist in regarding the Christian church as just an institution,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   one institution amongst others, just a human organization.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But that isn't the church.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   The church is this body in which God himself dwells.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And what he does in revival is to remind us of that.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   When God acts in revival, everybody present feels and knows that God is there.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Of course, we believe this. We believe this by faith.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Yes, but we should know it. We should have a realization of it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   We should be conscious of his nearness.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And that is what revival does.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   "I'm going to do this thing," says God, "and then all of you will realize that I'm among you.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I'm acting in your midst. I, the living God, have come down amongst you.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I'm in you. You are my people, and I dwell in you, and I walk in you."
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   That is what the church needs to realize today.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And of course, it's the very thing she doesn't realize.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's the thing we are always forgetting.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   So I put that first, but then I go on to say things like this.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   In reminding us of that, God, of course, at the same time, reminds us
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   that the whole power that should be manifested in the church is his power.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   That everything the church does should be a manifestation of the power of God.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   What is the gospel?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Well, do you remember the answer of the apostle Paul?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   It is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   How easy it is to forget that, isn't it?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   How easy to preach it as a system, preach it as a collection of ideas,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   just preach it as a truth.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Ah, but you can do that without power.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   There are people, says the apostle Paul, who have a form of godliness,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   but deny the power thereof.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Christianity is primarily a life. It's a power.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   It's a manifestation of energy.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And as we realize that the living God is among us,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   we shall realize more and more this tremendous power.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And then that will in turn lead us to realize that the one thing that matters
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   is that we should be rightly related to God,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and always reliant upon his power.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   The apostle's great claim, you remember, in writing to the Corinthians,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the first epistle, second chapter, is this,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   that when he preached to them he didn't preach with wisdom of men.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   It wasn't with enticing words of men's wisdom.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   He could have done that.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   He was a very able and a very learned and a very well-read man.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   But though he was going to a seat of learning, there was a university in Corinth,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   and he knew the mentality of the Greeks.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   He didn't approach them along that line at all.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He tells them later that he became a fool for Christ's sake.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And many of them despised him, of course, because of that.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But, says the apostle, I didn't come in that way.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Well, in what way then?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Oh, he says, in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   but in the power of God.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   This is something of which we all need to be reminded.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Let me make a confession for all preachers.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Do you know the standing temptation of a preacher?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   This is the besetting sin of every preacher.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   I'm speaking for myself also.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   This is the danger.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   That after you've prepared your sermons, you feel that all is well.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   You've got your two sermons ready for Sunday.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Well, that's all right.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   You've got your sermon, you've got your notes,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   and you can speak and you can deliver your message.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   But that isn't preaching.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   That can be utterly useless.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Oh, it may be entertaining,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   there may be a certain amount of intellectual stimulus and profit in it,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   but that isn't preaching.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Preaching is in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And a man has to realize that after he's prepared his sermons,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   it doesn't matter how perfectly, that it's all waste and useless,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   unless the power of the Spirit comes upon it and upon him.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   He must pray for that.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   But not only he.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   You must also pray for that.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   How many of you prayed before you came here today or yesterday,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   that the Spirit of God might come upon me and use me and use my message?
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   You have to pray for that as well as I.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Otherwise you're looking to me and to my message.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   No, no, we must all together look to God
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   and realize our utter dependence upon the power that He alone can give.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And you see, whenever you get a revival and God's power is manifested,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   you needn't urge people to pray, then they do.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   They want to see more and more of it.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Very well, revival encourages us to do that.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And that's why it's good for us to read these accounts
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   and to look back on what God has done,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   that we may realize that the living God is among us.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   And we must pray to Him to manifest this power.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And to put it negatively, of course, it means this,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that it delivers us from any and every form of self-reliance.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   That is the curse of the Church, self-reliance.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   There's no difficulty at all about explaining the state of the Christian Church today.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   It's so perfectly simple.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I'll tell you why the Church is as she is today.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   It's self-reliance in these forms.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   One, reliance upon scholarship and learning.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Came in, of course, about the middle of the last century.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   "Ah," people began to say, "we now are becoming more educated and we've advanced."
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Of course, we don't want the sort of thing they had in the last century
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   under Whitefield and Wesley and so on.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   We want now learned sermons.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   And so they began to have them.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And great attention was paid to form and to style and to diction.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Sermons were published, and obviously as the man was writing them,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   he'd got his eye on publication,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   rather than on the service in which he was going to preach his sermon.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Everything became learned and scholarly and philosophical,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   and great sermons were delivered.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And it's one of the main causes and explanations of the state of the Church today.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Reliance upon human learning and knowledge and wisdom.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And then, of course, the reliance upon organizing.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   In the last hundred years, the Church has multiplied her organizations
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   and her institutions in a way that she's never done before in all her long history.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   There have never been so many subsections of the Christian Church as during this present century.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Everything is being organized. Age groups, everything else.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And there are head offices which send you down the literature telling you how to do it,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   how to handle children, how to handle youth, young people, advice on this and that,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   all perfectly organized.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And yet look at the state of the Church.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   They're relying on the organization.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Others rely on their own activities.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   As long as they're busy, they think tremendous things are happening.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And of course, if you organize and if you're active, it'll be reported in the papers.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   They must have something to report, and there it is.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   And people say, "Tremendous things are happening. Look at it!"
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But what is happening? Look at the Church. That's the answer.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   No, no, my dear friends.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   We need to learn once more
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   the difference between bustle and business on the one hand
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and the hand of the Lord that it is mighty on the other hand.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   You know, when God acts,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and when people realize that the living God is amongst them,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   they're humbled, they're abased.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Men don't count any longer.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And the reports are not about what men have done, but about what God has done,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   and what's happened to men as the result of God's action.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   A revival always humbles men, abases them, casts them to the floor,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   makes them feel they can do nothing,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   fills them with a sense of reverence and of godly fear.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   Oh, how absent it is amongst us.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   How men are standing forward, but when revival comes, men are pushed back.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   They're humbled to the ground, I say,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   and the glory is given to God because it is God's power that is in evidence.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Let me hurry to something else.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   And this, of course, follows biological necessity.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   When all this happens, the fear of men is taken away from us in every form.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Let me go back again to verse 10 of chapter 3. Listen.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   And Joshua said, "Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   and the Hittites and the Hivites and the Perisites and the Gergesites
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and the Amorites and the Jebusites."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   That's it.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   The children of Israel were about to enter into the promised land
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and they'd been hearing about the Canaanites and the Hittites
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   and the Hivites and the Perisites and the Gergesites, etc.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   The spies had been sent forward and they came back and said,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   "You know, there are giants in that land,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   and when we looked at them we felt that we were but as grasshoppers."
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And they were trembling, they were afraid of these great powers
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   that they've got to meet when they enter the promised land.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Here's the answer.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   When you know that the living God is amongst you,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   what are the Hittites?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Who are the Gergesites and the Jebusites?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   What are the whole lot of them put together?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   They become as nothing.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The fear of men is taken away immediately
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   when we realize that the living God is among us.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And if ever the church needed this, it is now.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   The church is so afraid.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   She's afraid of organized sin, you see.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   This is the argument. Haven't you heard it so often?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   "We must be doing something," they say,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "because look at the world, it's attracting the young people,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   gives them a happy, pleasant Saturday night,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   entertains them, teaches them how to sing and do this and that."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   Well, we must do the same thing.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Bring in, what is it called, your skiffle or whatever it is,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   into your Sunday night service.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   That's what they're like, you see.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   The world's doing it and the young people so like it.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And because they're so afraid, they've got to lose their young people.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   We must begin to do this.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   Oh, what a tragedy, what a departure from this.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   See, they're afraid of the young people.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The church has been afraid of the young people for a long time.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   That's why she's multiplied these institutions to try and hold them and to attract them.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Not only young people, not only organized sin in its various forms,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   they say, "What can we do?"
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You see, we're up against the television.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   There wasn't television 200 years ago.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   They hadn't got a radio, they hadn't got cinemas.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   "There's our problem."
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   "What? We must do something," they say.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   They're afraid of these organizations and powers.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   And then they're terrified of learning and of knowledge.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   You see, they say, "Look what these people are saying in the Brains Trust and these other things.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And our people are reading these things."
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   You know, "Is it intellectually respectable to be a Christian?"
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   "Can you really talk about miracles still and about dividing the Red Sea and Georgia?"
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   You know, people, they say, "They won't believe."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So we trim and modify our gospel because we're afraid of learning and of knowledge and of science.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   That's what the church has been doing for a hundred years.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And that's why she is as she is.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And communism, it's spreading, they say.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And it's got these marvelous powers.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   It uses these instruments.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Well, we must use them.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And we must get in our word over and against them.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   But we don't seem to be succeeding, do we?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And we must get our literature in.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   All right, go on doing all these things, I say.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   But if you rely upon them, you're already defeated.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   No, no.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   There is no need to be afraid of any of these powers.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   They've always been there.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   There's nothing new about all this.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   The Christian church has always had to fight the world and the flesh and the devil.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   She had to fight the Roman Empire at the beginning.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   She had to fight the malignity of the Jews.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   She's always had these enemies who were out to exterminate her.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And the church has often quaked and feared.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   But never when there's been revival.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Because then they know that the living God is among them.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perisites, the Gergashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   He names them one by one, you see, as I've been trying to do.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   What are we to fear of all these things when the living God comes amongst us?
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Oh, for a touch of his power.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Oh, that the church might realize that this is the answer.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And our fear of all our enemies and opponents would vanish like the morning mist.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Fear him, ye saints.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And you will then have nothing else to fear.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   That's how the writer of the hymn puts it.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And how right he is.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Well, revival does that for us.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And thus, you see, for me to sum it up, it makes us looking, keeps us looking to him and dependent upon him.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Our supreme need and our only need is to know God, the living God, and the power of his might.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   We need nothing else.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   It's just that.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   The power of the living God.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   To know that the living God is among us.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And that nothing else matters.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   So we wait upon him.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   We look to him.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   We cry out unto him.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   As Moses did when he was there before the Red Sea and didn't know what to do,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   and the people were grumbling and complaining.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And God answered Moses and said, "Why fallest thou upon the ground before me?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Speak to the children of Israel that they move forward."
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And on they went.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Standing in his great might, with all his strength imbued,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and take to arm you for the fight, the panoply of God.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   That's what we need, my friends.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And that's why I'm urging you to pray for revival.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   We must look to him.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   God does this in order to give us encouragement, to show us that he's among us.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   And the reminder of what happened a hundred years ago should lead us to turn back to him.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I say forget everything else.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Forget everything else.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   We need to realize the presence of the living God amongst us.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Let everything else be silent.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   This is no time for minor differences.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   We all need to know the touch of the power of the living God.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And let us continue and wait until we know it.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And then God does this, of course, for me to conclude,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   in order to deliver us from our enemies, enemies without enemies within.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Yes, why did he do these things?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Well, to bring these people out of Egypt, out of the wilderness,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   into the blessed land of Canaan.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   He does it, I say, in order to lead us to the land of blessings.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   What does this mean in the church?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   It means this.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   You've never had a revival but that it has led to praise and to thanksgiving,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   to enjoyment at the riches of God's grace.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   The great characteristic of revival is ultimately praise, adoration, worship,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   full enjoyment, full, unmixed, and evermore.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   But in conclusion, let me just direct your attention to one other thing.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   We've considered this great fact, what happens in revival.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   We've considered the nature of the fact, the miraculous, the almighty power of God.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   We've asked the question, why does God do this?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   I want to ask a last question.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   When, when does God do this?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   You want to know that, I hope.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   If you're longing and yearning, I'm sure you're asking the question,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "Oh, when is God going to do this?"
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   We've been praying, many of us, for years, nothing seems to happen.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   When, when does God do this?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   When does he send revival?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   The answer is here, as it is confirmed by the history of the church.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   There seem to me to be two main factors here.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   The first is this, God seems to do this always after a period of great trial
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and great discouragement.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Note what I'm saying.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   When does he do this?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Well, the text reminds us of two occasions, the crossing of the Red Sea,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   the crossing of the River of Jordan.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   When does he do it?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Oh, he does it, then, I say, after you've been in Egypt for a while,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   in the bondage, in the captivity, in the cruelty of Egypt,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   with the taskmasters and the lashes of their whips,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   trying to make you make bricks without sufficient straw.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Egypt, bondage, aridity, cruelty, persecution, trial.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   He does it after Egypt.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   He does it also after a period in the wilderness.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Here are the children of Israel, right before Jordan.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Yes, but they'd just been forty years in the wilderness,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   in the howling, barren wilderness, without a home,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   with its storms and its trials, its testings and its provings,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   all that had happened to them in the wilderness.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Read the story, and what a sad story it is.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Yes, they've had a wilderness experience.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   And on top of it, they'd had another calamity,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   which much to many of them had seemed to be the end of all things.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Moses, their great leader, had died.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   He'd gone up onto a mountain, and he'd never come back again.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   The men who'd come to them originally with a message from God,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   and had addressed them in their utter serfdom when they were broken-hearted,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   the men who'd led them through so much, he's gone.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And a man called Joshua is left to lead them.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Who is he, and what is he?
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   The position you see seemed to be utterly discouraging.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Forty years in the wilderness and without a leader.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Ah, thank God for this.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   It is after such experiences that God sends revival.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   After Egypt, after the wilderness experience.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   God knows.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   The Christian church has been in this wilderness many a long year.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   You go back and read the history of the church before,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   somewhere around about 1830 or 1840,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   and you will find that in many countries there used to be regular revivals of religion
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   almost every ten years or so.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   It hasn't been like that.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   There has only been one major revival since 1859.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Oh, we've passed through a barren period.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   That devastating higher criticism,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   the evil that it's done in pulpits, in pews, everywhere.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   People have lost their belief in this living God,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   and in the atonement and in reconciliation,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   human wisdom, philosophy and learning.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   We've passed through one of the most barren periods in the long history of the church.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   We've been like the prodigal son in that far country,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   spending our time in the fields with the swine,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   and living on nothing but husks.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Yes, we've been in bondage, we've been in fear,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   we've suffered persecution and derision,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and it's still going on.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   We are still in the wilderness.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Don't believe anything that suggests to you that we're out of it.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   We are not.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   The church is in the wilderness.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   But thank God,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   it is always after such a period
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   that God acts,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and does his mighty deeds,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   and shows forth his glory.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Yes, but that brings me to my second condition, which was this,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and it seems to me to be so important.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   It is not only after Egypt,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   it is not only after the wilderness.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   The real moment when he does it,
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   the moment of crisis, is this.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   When you are right up against the Red Sea,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   when you are actually on the border of Jordan,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   it's then he does it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   You see, you can be forty years in the wilderness,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   the mere fact of being in the wilderness doesn't produce it.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   No, no, it's not only in the wilderness,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   but when you've actually arrived at this critical position.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   If I may use modern terminology,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   God always seems to do this, it seems to me,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   when we are right up against it,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   and so much up against it that we are hopeless and helpless.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Do you remember the picture at the Red Sea?
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Here it is.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   The children of Israel have been commended to go on.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   Where are they to go?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Well, they were taken to a point at which,
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   on the one side was Paya Ha'areth,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and on the other side, Be'el Zephan,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   two mountains, one each side of them.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Behind them, Pharaoh and his hosts and the chariots.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   The army of Israel,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   and here are the defenseless children of Israel
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   with nothing to defend them at all.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Mountain here, mountain there, the enemy behind.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   In front, Red Sea.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Complete and entire hopelessness and despair.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   And the children grumbling and complaining,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   asking Moses, "What's he mean?"
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And Moses says, "Nothing to do but to fall before God."
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And then the answer comes, and the Red Sea is divided.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   Oh, it was exactly the same here at Jordan.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   We are even given this interesting detail, do you see,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   that the river of Jordan was badly over-flooded
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   for long months at that time of the year.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   They couldn't possibly cross it.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Here they are facing a flood.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   How can they get through?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   It is then that God arises and manifests the right hand of his power
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   and gives a display of his glory.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   I just put this to you in the form of a challenge.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Read the histories and the accounts of every revival that has ever taken place,
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   and you will invariably find this,
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   that the one man or the group, the little group of people
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   who have been used in this way by God to send revival,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   they have always known a state of utter desperation
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   and final despair.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Every one of them.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Read the journals of Whitefield.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Read the journals of Wesley.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   Read the life history of all these men.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Read the story of the group.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   They have always come to this place
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   where they have realized their utter and absolute impotence.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Their final paralysis.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   There is the Red Sea.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Here is the enemy.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   There are the men.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   They are shot in.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   They are shot down.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   They are crushed to their knees.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It is always the prerequisite.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It is always the moment at which God acts.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And that is what, I confess, troubles me and discourages me today.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   The Christian church is still so healthy,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   so confident in herself,
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   so sure that she only needs to organize yet another effort,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   still some further activity.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   She has not come up to the Red Sea.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   She has never been to Pyre Hieroth and Beelzebub.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   She does not know that experience, and until she does,
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   I cannot see that we have much reason for anticipating
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   a revival of religion and an outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   It may be, you see, that things will yet have to happen to us,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   infinitely worse than what we have already known.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   You would have thought that two world wars would have done it, but it hasn't.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You would have thought the present position would be enough, but it isn't.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   God have mercy upon us.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Until, I say, we arrive there, Pyre Hieroth, Beelzebub, Mygdal,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   the enemy of the Red Sea, the utter hopelessness,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   the Jordan in flood, the utter impossibility,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   the final hopelessness and despair.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   May God bring us to that realization.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   May he so reveal his own glory and holiness to us.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   May he reveal unto us our utter impotence and hopelessness.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   May we see these things in such a way that we shall cease from men
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   and look only to the living God.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And then there is no question, he will hear us,
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   and he will manifest his glory and his power.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Amen.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
