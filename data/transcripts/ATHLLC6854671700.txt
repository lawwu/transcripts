[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.380]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.640]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.060]   and today we're gonna talk about the best strategies
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.880]   and tactics for your work.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.240]   That means finding a job you love, interviewing,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.580]   negotiating your comp, managing up, making an impact,
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.680]   getting promoted, and a lot more.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.400]   And to do this, I'm joined by Lenny Ruchitsky,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800]   who sold his company to Airbnb in 2012
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.760]   and spent seven years working in product across the company
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.480]   before leaving to start his newsletter
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.320]   and more recently podcast.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.080]   Now, Lenny is well-known as one of the top minds
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.560]   in the world when it comes to building
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080]   and growing software products.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.180]   And his podcast, Lenny's Podcast,
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.340]   is the number one product podcast in the world.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.360]   But building products is not why we're here today.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.220]   It's because he's written so many amazing newsletters
[00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.760]   about professional work that I've personally found
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.940]   so valuable to my career.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.480]   So, whether you're looking for a job right now,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.800]   trying to have more impact in your current role,
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.440]   or thinking about what's next,
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.280]   I am sure you'll love this episode.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.900]   And speaking of jobs,
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.200]   I have a big announcement to share on my end.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440]   After three amazing years at Wealthfront,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.840]   I am finally stepping away to focus on all the hacks
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.880]   full-time starting tomorrow, December 1st.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.640]   It's a bit of a scary jump to leave a stable job,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   but I love what I'm doing with the podcast
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.480]   and newsletter so much that I felt like I had to see
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.000]   what was possible if I focus on it full-time.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.960]   I'll have a lot more to share on this soon,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.800]   but wanted to make sure you guys heard the news first.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.520]   All right, let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.800]   Lenny, thanks for being here.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.520]   - My pleasure, Chris.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.400]   - So, you have written a ton of content
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.200]   about product management and amongst product managers,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.280]   which I formerly was, you are well-known in that space
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.120]   for being a thought leader.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   However, I found that a lot of your content
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320]   is very, very applicable outside of product management
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.680]   to anyone who has a job.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.520]   And now we're probably gonna dig into a little bit more
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.080]   about the transition to creators.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.320]   I just gotta ask, are you aware of the breadth
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.040]   of applicability of your content?
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.080]   And do you see a transition in the future
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.520]   to just more than product-related content
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.920]   and just really growing beyond that?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.360]   - I am aware the content is useful to a lot of people
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.800]   other than product managers because I get emails from people
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.640]   and they're like,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.440]   "Hey, our marketing team's finding this super useful."
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.760]   The funniest example is my mother-in-law who is 75,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.960]   I think, something like that.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.360]   And she reads every post that I write
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.000]   and find something in there that is applicable to her life.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.760]   And that just shows me that there's all these little lessons
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.680]   that you can extract from things that are specifically meant
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.560]   for product managers and founders.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.880]   But I will say, I try very hard to stay focused on a PM,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.640]   a founder, someone building product,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   because I think that's the reason it does well
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.560]   is it's solving like a very clear person's problem.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720]   And if I were to try to broaden it too wide,
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.880]   I think it would just lose the power
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.160]   and just become nothing amazing for any one person.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.640]   So it is a balance, but it is cool
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640]   that the second order effect becomes useful
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.080]   to a lot of other people.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.560]   - So for anyone listening, Lenny has a newsletter,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.520]   Lenny has a podcast.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   I have been a guest on his podcast
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.600]   that may or may not have come out before
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.520]   or after this comes out and highly recommend it,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   even if you're not in product,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.000]   just like your mother-in-law said.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.040]   However, we're not gonna talk that much
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.000]   about product today.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.160]   We're gonna talk about some of those other things.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400]   And in fact, I thought as I went through
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.480]   a lot of your posts that you have a really unique
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.360]   and great perspective on the process
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.520]   of someone going through their career,
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.320]   both getting a job, working at a company,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.560]   starting on your own.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.320]   And I've thought a lot about this too.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.400]   So I thought we could just have a conversation
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   to walk through that process.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.560]   And you could share a lot of the lessons
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.480]   you've learned and shared and written about for anyone,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.400]   whether they're trying to advance their career today
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   or they're looking for something new
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.280]   or they're looking for something right now
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.360]   because we're in an unfortunate situation
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.960]   where some people may have lost their jobs.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.400]   And I would love to give them more tools
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.080]   to be successful in their search.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.640]   So how's that sound?
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.280]   - Sounds great with the caveat that I write these posts
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   and then the content leaves my brain and lives in the post.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.760]   And part of the reason I write them is like,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.080]   hey, go read this thing 'cause I forgot all the answers.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.600]   So I'll do my best to extract what I can remember.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.120]   And I did a little prep,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.080]   but I won't have all of the answers in my head
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.960]   on demand necessarily.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.320]   - Well, fortunately for you,
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.680]   I try to do a really good job
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.280]   of putting resources in the show notes.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.200]   So if there's one that we feel like your answer
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.240]   is lacking in comparison to what I've seen you write,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.960]   I will make sure that we link that so people can follow up.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.200]   But let's start with the process
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.080]   of finding the right kind of job.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.200]   So there are so many types of companies out there.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.960]   What advice do you have for people looking for something new,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.600]   both in just how to narrow down the options
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   and actually stand out to candidates
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.960]   to get that first interview?
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   So just thinking that process.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.640]   And for side note, Lenny also runs a job board
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.080]   and a talent collective for people in the product space.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.520]   So you've seen this both as a person in it
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   and a person creating this thing.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920]   So just to recap, how do people narrow down
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.000]   what they wanna do and find a company
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.840]   and then actually stand out to get in the door?
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.280]   - Yeah, let me talk about the job board briefly
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.200]   'cause I think it's a cool piece of context
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.680]   that shows kind of how much I spend thinking about
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.080]   people's profiles and companies and things like that.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.680]   So it's called Lenny's Jobs.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.360]   It runs on this platform called Palette,
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.560]   which is kind of like the sub stack for job boards.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.360]   It's kind of this white labeled job platform.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.440]   And the way it works, there's kind of two parts to it.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   There's a regular job board
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.360]   where people just post job openings.
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   And then there's a reverse job board
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.080]   where candidates can sign up
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.720]   because they're interested in new opportunities
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.560]   and they can just be like,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.280]   hey, I'm open to a new opportunity.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.000]   I'd love to hear from interesting companies.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.200]   And it can be anonymous.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.480]   You could hide yourself from companies
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.800]   that you don't want to see that you're looking for a job.
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.000]   And it's doing really well.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.560]   It's become maybe the number one place
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.600]   to find product people.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.480]   I don't know where else you'd go look for PMs
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.840]   better than this place.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.200]   And fun fact, I make more income from just a job board
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.440]   than I made at Airbnb in salary.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.280]   - Wow.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.600]   - And so it turns into a really interesting business
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.080]   on the side and shows the power of an audience
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.440]   with the newsletter and like the audience of that
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.320]   being funneled to the job board, creating a marketplace.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.200]   It's really interesting experience.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.080]   - If you look at people
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.640]   that actually end up getting jobs from this,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.880]   is it more from people finding the job from the employer
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.960]   or have things changed in the environment
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.160]   where the employee putting themselves out there
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.680]   is actually leading to more jobs?
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   - Yeah, so one thing I've learned from this
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   is job boards do not work well.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.080]   And a job board meaning you post an opening on a job board.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.000]   If it works for you,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.480]   it's like the best ROI in the history of hiring
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.800]   'cause it's like 50 bucks, 100 bucks, 200 bucks
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.600]   to post a job and you find someone for that
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.720]   and then you're done.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   But it almost never works is what I found.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.440]   What actually worked is the reverse, the other piece,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.720]   where candidates that are awesome apply.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.480]   I approve them and I only approve about 10% of people
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.320]   to keep the quality by really high.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.840]   And that has led to so many companies finding.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.600]   PMs, that's a product, VPs a product.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.800]   And so I think that model is a lot more effective
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.080]   now before the economy changed.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.760]   And so I'm leaning into that.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.320]   I'm kind of moving away from the job board.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.120]   - And this site you said, Palette,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.440]   is there a directory of all the different job boards
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   they power for something like this?
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.600]   If someone listening is like, I'm not a PM,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.520]   but I would love to participate
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.280]   in this reverse job search process
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.120]   to put myself out there in front of companies.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.400]   Are there other job boards or a directory of them
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.200]   to go find places to post yourself?
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   - Yeah, they actually have a cool feature.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.440]   I think it's called Spotlight where you work with them
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.840]   and they give you access to a ton of different job boards
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.280]   for specific profiles.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.960]   And so I get these applications for one company
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.120]   looking for like a designer
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.920]   and they can just only look at my designer.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.880]   And then they can find candidates.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   So yeah, that's pretty cool what they're building.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.080]   - Awesome.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.960]   If you're building this profile, right,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400]   you're a candidate setting aside that it's in product,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.320]   but what are the things you think you've seen people do
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.480]   to one, stand out,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.160]   but also to identify what they're interested in?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.000]   'Cause I think there's a world of all kinds of companies
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.200]   you could work at.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.040]   - The way I think about it,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.120]   there's a lot of personal things
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.200]   that are important to people,
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.320]   like where they work, where they live,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.560]   and how hard they want to work and things like that.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.880]   But I'd say if you just,
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.080]   if I think of four things that are really important,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.360]   I think of the people at the company,
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.080]   the stage of the company, the mission of the company,
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.400]   and then just the quality of the business.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   So just to go through them briefly.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   So with people, what I look for,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.840]   and what I think you should look for is
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.120]   where the smartest people going to go work,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.000]   trying to go work, or already working.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.800]   And there's a few reasons why that's really powerful.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.120]   One is it's more likely that they'll build
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.520]   an awesome product and awesome business
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.560]   that'll do really well.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.760]   So the smartest people working in a company
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.980]   more likely to succeed.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.920]   Two, you'll learn a lot more from that group.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.440]   If you're just working with the smartest people,
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.720]   you can find you're gonna learn a lot more.
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.560]   And then three,
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.960]   which is a little bit underappreciated, I think,
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.400]   the alumni network that you build from a company
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.640]   that you work at ends up being a really huge asset
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.800]   if you work at a company that ends up succeeding
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.120]   and doing well and growing.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.720]   So there's a lot of benefit to working in a place
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.760]   where you can build this really smart,
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.920]   successful, growing alumni network.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.760]   As an example, a friend and I started
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240]   the Airbnb Alumni Investing Syndicate.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.400]   It's called Air Angels.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.680]   We invest in companies as a group.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.440]   There's about 500 of us in the syndicate.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.200]   And basically we find companies to invest in.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.780]   We invest using an SPV and look for ways to be helpful.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.040]   And it ends up being a really awesome, fun experience
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.560]   we all learn together.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.360]   That's one, find the place
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.540]   where the smartest people you know are going.
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.280]   Two, I think a lot of people underappreciate
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.440]   the importance of stage of company.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   There's such a different experience
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   working at a startup versus a big company.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.720]   And so I think it's really important to think about
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.080]   what's the stage that you wanna focus on.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.920]   I find there's like a really nice middle ground
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.280]   where you look for a series B or a series C company
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.360]   where it's not so early that it's likely
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.160]   to go out of business or it's gonna be like
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.680]   so stressful all the time,
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.560]   but it's not like a meta or Google.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.680]   And so that's an interesting middle ground
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   where it's still like a lot of upside,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.920]   still really fast moving.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.400]   And there's a lot of opportunity
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.760]   but not boring and slow and big company.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.120]   So stage, I would think about the mission of the company.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.520]   If you like look back on your life,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.800]   you're gonna be like, okay, look,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.040]   I spent three years at this company.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.560]   I moved this metric 5%.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   And so like, you're not gonna be that excited about that
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.080]   unless the mission is something that you really care about.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.520]   And moving that metric 5% leads to something
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.800]   that matters in the world.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.980]   As an example, Airbnb, they basically help people travel
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.440]   and go on better trips.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.760]   And if you ask people, what would you do?
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.520]   And this applies to your podcast a little bit.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.840]   Like what would you do if you had all the money in the world?
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.860]   Everyone says I travel.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.400]   And how cool is it to let people go on better trips,
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.160]   more trips, have better experiences.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   So there's a really meaningful mission there.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.720]   And then the fourth is you just wanna pay attention
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.760]   to the quality of the business.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.240]   Like, is it gonna work out?
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.080]   Is it gonna grow?
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.360]   Do I have to keep raising money forever?
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.600]   Are they gonna be profitable?
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.660]   Especially important in today's climate.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.600]   And this is especially important
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   because one of the most powerful things you can do
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.840]   to give yourself a chance to get a better job
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.400]   is to have a logo or two from a company people recognize
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.000]   and respect because that kind of pre-validates
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   that you're solid.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.360]   Somebody else has interviewed you that you really trust.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.040]   And they've said, Chris is great.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.880]   We hired him.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.700]   He worked here two years.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.540]   That says a lot.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.720]   They may not necessarily be amazing,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.840]   but at least it's some level that gives you a quick like,
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.520]   okay, I'll talk to this person.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.160]   So you wanna work at a company that ends up being like,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.480]   oh, wow, they worked that.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.200]   Now we're gonna talk to them.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.400]   So those are the four.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.440]   - I had an idea around that
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.280]   when I first wanted to get a job at a startup.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.440]   I was like, I'm gonna pick a startup
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.960]   that's really popular, people will remember.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.480]   And I was like, what company just raised a bunch of money?
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.640]   What's in the Zeitgeist?
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.600]   It turns out I was wrong.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.800]   And that company ended up like not actually going on
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.000]   to raise any further funding.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   But that was a hypothesis I had actually played out
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.800]   because five years later,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.040]   even though that company was out of business,
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.120]   people were like, oh, I remember that company.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.960]   And so just the fact that I worked at this company
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.640]   that was a hot company at the time,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.920]   even though it went out of business
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.200]   within a small niche of people was valuable.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.600]   I'll add on a couple thoughts to what you said,
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.080]   which is when you talk about stage
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.040]   and for people listening that aren't in tech,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.800]   forget whether it's series A, series B or something,
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.560]   it's just a small company, big company.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.760]   Another way to think about those stages
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.680]   is the speed at which you will learn
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.720]   and the type of learning you will do.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.560]   If you want to really hone your craft in a specific vertical,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.240]   a later stage company is often gonna be a place
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.680]   where you can really focus on one thing
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.120]   and really hone that skill,
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.560]   whether it's a set of managerial skills or anything.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.960]   At an early stage company,
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.160]   you're going to accelerate the speed at which you learn,
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.520]   but it might not be as focused on craft
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.600]   or at least so I've found
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.720]   because there's so many opportunities.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.760]   You might think you're doing one role in product,
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.440]   but you might also be doing a role in marketing
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.320]   and you might also be the janitor sometimes.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   I think I've had every role at a company
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.640]   except engineer at times.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   And that happens at a smaller company.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.040]   So while you might trade off stability,
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.760]   you might learn a ton and a lot faster
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.840]   and be able to make transitions easier.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.440]   If you're trying to jump into a new career,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.920]   it's gonna be a lot easier at a small company to say,
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   "Hey, I've never done this thing,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.920]   but can I jump in and try it?"
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.560]   And at a small company, someone's like,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.360]   "Oh, Lenny's really good at this thing.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.560]   Let's let Lenny do that."
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.800]   And then you can move across very easily.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.320]   - Yeah, that reminds me a story
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.640]   of when we sold our company to Airbnb,
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.320]   that's how I joined Airbnb.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.960]   I went from being the CEO of the startup
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.440]   to a PM at Airbnb and I felt such relief
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.320]   not having to think about all the things at the company
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.080]   and just focus on the one problem
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.080]   that we had to solve at Airbnb.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.520]   Like you would think that's painful,
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.640]   but it was so nice.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.040]   And I have to think about fundraising
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.400]   and I have to think about paying people salaries every month.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.120]   It was just like, "Cool, we're gonna solve this problem.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.960]   Life's gonna be so much easier."
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.840]   Sometimes you want that, sometimes you don't.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.280]   - My wife was a chief of staff at Lyft for a bunch of years.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.200]   She joined when the company was very small
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.480]   and she had the opposite experience,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.200]   which was she got to see everything.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.360]   And it was an amazing opportunity
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.320]   because the company was growing
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.440]   and she wore every hat there was.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.640]   And finally she was like,
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.880]   "Oh, I'm spinning up a team to work on insurance.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   I don't love that.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.760]   I'm spinning up a team to work on BD.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.680]   Oh, I'm like really interested in this.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.880]   Let's go do that."
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.920]   And then she built a career in BD
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.600]   and loves doing BD and partnership stuff,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.080]   but she never would have found that
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.080]   if she hadn't joined a company small enough
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.280]   to be able to do lots of stuff.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.240]   And then this is a little bit out of the way
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.720]   'cause it's difficult to find these people,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   but I think about trying to think about
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.320]   who you want to work for also.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.800]   So in any industry,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.520]   there are people that are well-known in their industry.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.640]   You could look at like any conference for an industry,
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.720]   like who are the people speaking?
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.280]   Who are the people that are writing?
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.840]   Who are the people you respect?
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   And sometimes there might be a good opportunity
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   to go learn from that person.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.400]   And it might not be the mission that you love,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.160]   but it might be the best mentor you can find.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.920]   And so that's another thing
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.120]   that I think you could focus on
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.720]   when you're trying to figure out where to go,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.640]   what's important to you.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.040]   It's like, do I care about the mission
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   and will that fulfill me?
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.160]   Or do I care about the learning?
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.240]   Will that fulfill me?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.080]   Or do I care about the resume boost?
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.920]   Will that fulfill me?
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.360]   All of those are options.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.440]   You just have to process them all.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.640]   - Yeah, it reminds me of a quote
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   that I don't know if I believe,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.880]   but a lot of people believe it,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.720]   that you don't quit a job, you quit a manager.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.640]   So to your point,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   finding a manager that you're really excited about
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.920]   and think you can learn from and want to work from
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.200]   and that will champion you is really important.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.040]   And I think super underappreciated.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.160]   In my career, the biggest trajectory inflection
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   was just one manager I had that just taught me a ton
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.040]   and just pushed me to do better.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:21.880]   And to your point,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.960]   there's so much power and value in finding that person.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.600]   And if you can find the Japanese phrase Ikigai,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   if you're familiar, if you can find that,
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.200]   obviously it's like the dream, right?
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.400]   Which is the intersection of what you love,
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.400]   what you're good at, what the world needs
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.480]   and what you could get paid for.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.320]   That's the dream.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.640]   I'm learning as fast as I want
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.440]   at a company with the mission I want.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.720]   But I will say in my career,
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.240]   it's been very hard to find all of those things all the time
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.360]   and so you've got to prioritize
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.240]   and sometimes they morph into that,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.160]   but I wouldn't necessarily hold out
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.000]   for finding something that ticks every box.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.960]   - I think one way to think about it
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.280]   as long as you're getting closer to that,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.240]   because you, like your wife, you said,
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.360]   she like didn't know she wanted BD
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.680]   and the more experiences you have,
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.800]   the more you kind of narrow in on,
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.960]   okay, here's the thing I really want.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.040]   The other way to think about it
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   is I realized this is my fourth career.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   First I was a engineer, then I was a founder,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.960]   then I was a PM and I'm whatever I am now,
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.200]   one of the newsletter.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.840]   So there's always options to go change
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   and go in different directions
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.720]   as you learn more about what you're excited about.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.000]   Like you're not stuck in the path that you chose.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.920]   - I don't know about you,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.960]   but I went through investment banker,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.600]   management consultant, employee, PM, BD,
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.640]   then founder, then went to Google
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.760]   and was a venture capitalist.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.200]   I went through a lot and now I'm a creator.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.320]   I never knew half of those things
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.280]   more than three months before.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.120]   Like some of them I was like,
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   I never knew I was gonna be VC
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.680]   and then that opportunity arose.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.160]   I never thought I'd be a creator
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.760]   and then I started a podcast.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.640]   So I think you don't need to know the future.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.240]   I love this idea of where do you wanna be
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.600]   with your life in 10 years?
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.680]   And if you're in a career
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.080]   where that exercise is helpful, great.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.760]   But I can tell you that
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.880]   where would my career be in 10 years, 10 years ago
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.080]   would be so wildly off from where it ended up
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.440]   that maybe it would have been a fun exercise,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.640]   but it certainly wouldn't have been
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.160]   anywhere close to accurate.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.280]   - Yeah, I think to that point,
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.320]   there's so much value in a variety of experiences.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.280]   Like just doing a lot of different stuff
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.880]   later on ends up being really valuable
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.320]   to whatever you end up doing later.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.840]   I was just interviewing a newsletter guy
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.800]   who was like the number one tech newsletter on Substack
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.560]   and he's like, yeah, I launched a newsletter.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.280]   I got a thousand subscribers really quickly.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.520]   It just started working.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.480]   But in reality, I spent six years
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.440]   writing a book on engineering
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.800]   and then working at these jobs, learning a bunch of stuff.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.640]   So the thing you end up doing later
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.520]   ends up being built on the experiences you have.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.600]   And a lot of people don't understand the value
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.280]   of just trying a bunch of different stuff
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.080]   and not feeling like they have to be stuck.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.840]   Like here's the thing I'm gonna do for 10 years.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.920]   (air whooshing)
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.000]   Do you know about donor advised funds?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.080]   They're tax advantaged financial accounts
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.760]   for the sole purpose of charity.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.880]   Think 401ks and IRAs, but just for charity.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.320]   And DAFI is bringing them to the masses,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.280]   which is why I'm excited to partner with them
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.320]   for this episode.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.640]   DAFI is a new modern way to give
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.800]   and it stands for the donor advised fund for you.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.680]   With DAFI, it's so much easier
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.360]   to put money aside for charity.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   You can make your tax deductible contributions all at once,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.080]   or you can set aside a little each week or month.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.320]   And you don't just have to donate cash.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:25.720]   You can easily contribute stocks, ETFs, or crypto.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.840]   Then you can give to more than 1 1/2 million charities,
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.760]   schools, and faith-based organizations
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.120]   in a matter of seconds.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.700]   My favorite part is that it lets you be more strategic
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.000]   with your giving and your tax planning
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.760]   by having a single source of charitable deductions.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.040]   Plus, you don't have to deal with the hassle
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.320]   of tracking receipts from your donations.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.360]   To start giving today and get your free $25
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.320]   to give to the charity of your choice,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.480]   go to allthehacks.com/DAFI.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.160]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.280]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.880]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.760]   So I love having an easy way
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.960]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.840]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.720]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.960]   for this episode.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   I started taking it because I wanted to see
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.280]   what all the hype was about,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.360]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.760]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.880]   add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.120]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.480]   and energized for the day,
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.240]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.600]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.080]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.900]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.360]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.060]   or artificial anything.
[00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.840]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.360]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you a free one-year supply
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.280]   of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.680]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.200]   All you have to do is visit
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.880]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.720]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.760]   to take ownership over your health
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.720]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.280]   It's like you found a job, you found a handful of jobs.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.680]   My personal belief is that in today's world,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.880]   you're much better off trying to narrow it down
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.080]   to three or four companies
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.800]   that you're really excited about
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.380]   and double down on your efforts to get in front of them.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.040]   Things I've done in the past are
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.320]   find every person that I can that knows them.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.920]   I've tried creating a presentation and sending it to them.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.420]   You could create a video about how excited you are.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.240]   Lots of things like that.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.920]   I've had this work for me,
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.260]   and I think it's underappreciated,
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.520]   but as a founder, someone emailed me and said,
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.120]   "I am so excited about your company.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.560]   "Here's my ideas."
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.400]   And I was like, "I have to interview this person."
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.080]   Like anyone who would take more than an hour
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.480]   to put something creative together about my company
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.000]   is someone I will want to talk to.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.040]   And the bigger the company, the more it's like,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.880]   "Well, they actually have to fit a role we're hiring for."
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.160]   But I've interviewed people who I was like,
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   "I don't even have a role for you,
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.040]   "but I just wanna understand who you are
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.960]   "so I know where to slot you in later."
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.840]   And you can't scale that if you're interviewing,
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   if you have a thousand companies you're excited about.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.200]   But if you have three, I'm like,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.720]   "Go all in on those three
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.600]   "before you try to find three more,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.340]   "because I think that you can easily stand out
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.360]   "by doing those things."
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.480]   There's an episode I did with Sunil Gupta
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.000]   who wrote a book called "Backable."
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.760]   And one time he just like did customer research
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.440]   for the company and sent it to me.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.720]   He was like, "Hey, I interviewed your customers.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.560]   "Here's what I learned."
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.320]   If you were in sales, you could go close a customer
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.140]   and be like, "Hey, I just convinced a customer
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.980]   "to sign up for you.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.560]   "I just wanted to let you know."
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.800]   Who doesn't wanna interview a person
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.680]   who's closing deals before they even work there?
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.440]   So I think if you can go through the hard exercise
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.800]   of figuring out what you want.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.420]   Those are my tactics of standing out.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.720]   I'm curious at what you've seen
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.200]   to try to have candidates either who've applied to you
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.120]   or you've done yourself
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.680]   to put yourself out there in different ways.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.040]   - I think that's awesome advice.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.120]   It reminds me, I was teaching a course on Maven
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.000]   about product management.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.760]   And I was interviewing coaches to help me with the course.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.220]   And I had about 10 coaches.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.760]   I was interviewing them with someone else
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.600]   that was helping me out with the course.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.540]   And one of the coaches started her own sub stack,
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.840]   subscribed me to it,
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.200]   and then just started writing posts
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.440]   about how she's the perfect fit to coach this course.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.140]   And I was like, "Holy shit.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.620]   "We need to make sure that we talk to her for sure."
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.040]   And we did, and it didn't work out there
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.200]   'cause she wasn't quite the fit,
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.060]   but I found something else to do with her.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.400]   And now she's a core part of my newsletter community,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.080]   helps run a lot of the programs.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:29.920]   - That's awesome.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.340]   - Yeah, I love that advice.
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.800]   I think that's awesome advice.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.000]   I think generally, the question is how do you stand out?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.840]   How do you stand out?
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.360]   Is there something really remarkable
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.600]   that gets someone's attention?
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.980]   There's a lot of ways to do it.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.600]   I do a lot of angel investing.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.480]   And whenever I get a founder that makes a loom,
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.840]   "Hey Lenny, I really wanted to talk to you
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.900]   "about the startup I'm building.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.480]   "Here's why it's awesome."
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.900]   I watch them.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.960]   Most of the time I talk to them
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.040]   'cause they put in the effort and they do something unique.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.640]   So I think it applies to investing too.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.080]   Pick the people you really want on your cap table
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.080]   and do some extra.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.240]   I think broadly, if you don't do anything like this,
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.480]   the things you need, 'cause I'm with the job board,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.440]   I probably reviewed 3000 profiles of people
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.960]   that applied to join the job board or the collective.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.680]   And so the things, like if you think about
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.840]   from the perspective of hiring manager,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.240]   like what are they looking when they're scanning resumes?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.760]   They're looking for logos that they recognize
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.400]   from companies that have pre-vetted that person
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.200]   in some form versus like a bunch of random companies
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.040]   they've never heard of.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.280]   You're not gonna be able to do a lot about this,
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.980]   but this is what hiring managers look for.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.360]   Companies that they respect,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.200]   that have done one pass at this person
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   and they're probably solid.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.720]   And then I think you mentioned this is just like impact,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.160]   show some kind of impact that you've driven.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.440]   Like they're hiring you to have impact.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.840]   What impact have you had in your career?
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.160]   And so the more you can highlight those things, the better.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.360]   But if you don't have those things, your advice is great.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.080]   Do something remarkable.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.680]   - I love the idea of like a loom resume.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.840]   I can imagine getting an email.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.160]   If you'd rather not look at another 50th resume of the day,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.200]   here's a five minute video
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   of me walking through the highlights.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.320]   And oh, by the way, you can put it on 2X
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.920]   if you wanna get through it in two and a half.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.320]   - I bet if I got an email that was like a little bit snarky,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.100]   a little bit funny, but a little bit informative,
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.940]   that would be great.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.360]   And if you don't have those logos,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.120]   it might be exactly what you need to get through that.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.080]   - Yeah, and then you could track
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   that they watch the video too,
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.760]   which is cool, you get an email.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.580]   - Oh yeah.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.160]   The app I use for editing my podcast, Descript,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.920]   has a loom like feature, but it doesn't have the tracking.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.600]   So now I'm like, oh, maybe I should switch over
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.520]   and start using loom.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.340]   - There you go.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.180]   - What about interviewing?
[00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.280]   Let's say I call you, I'm like,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.480]   oh, I decided I'm done creating a podcast.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.400]   I want this job.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.000]   Lenny, what advice do you have for me to nail the interview?
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.640]   - I like, I don't know if I'm going to give you anything
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.480]   that you haven't heard before,
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.680]   other than just spend a lot of time preparing,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.880]   like a lot of interview questions
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.560]   or stuff you'll hear from a lot of different people.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.060]   So I think that's probably 90% of it.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.000]   Just spend a bunch of time preparing.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.560]   If you're interviewing at a big company,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.160]   my sister was interviewing.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.000]   There's just like videos of all the interview questions
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.840]   they ask you online.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.680]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.840]   There's like courses you could take,
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.600]   like how to interview at Google.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.920]   And it's like all the questions they ask you.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.640]   And it's like, you can go through all of them.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.160]   There's like a pool basically.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.560]   So there's like a lot of answers out there
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.480]   if you put in the time.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.080]   Another piece is get good at telling your story
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.640]   and why you want to do this job,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.800]   what you've done in your career,
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.000]   highlight the things that have had impact.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.320]   I think it's just like, get good at pitching yourself.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.620]   And then you want to ask good questions of the interviewee.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.160]   People want you to ask them questions
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.760]   because they want to feel like you care about the company.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.720]   - If they want to not just hear it, but feel it.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.440]   You said, I've interviewed people who I'm like,
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.280]   why do you want to work here?
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.120]   And they're like, well,
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.400]   I'm at a financial planning startup.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.840]   And they're like, I just love personal finance.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.360]   I'm like, that's why you want to work in the industry.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.880]   That's not why you want to work here.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.520]   I would say, especially the smaller the company,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.440]   but it probably works at any scale.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.720]   If you don't have a really solid answer
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.120]   for why you want to work at this company,
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.920]   I think that is tough for the other person to hear
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.800]   if they ask you.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.720]   And even if they don't, I'd try to slot it in
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.760]   because I think that's great.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.800]   And I would also try to come up with a personal question
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.480]   that I know this sounds like a lot of work,
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.720]   but try to come up with the best question
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.840]   you can ask someone.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.600]   Because whenever anyone asks me a really hard question,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.960]   I remember that person.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.680]   I'm like, that person really thought hard about this.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   Or they transferred from interview to interview.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.680]   They're like, oh, this person told me
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.720]   this is your biggest problem that your company's facing.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.400]   And in the next one, they'd come in and say,
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.320]   hey, I talked to the head of marketing
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.680]   and they said this is the biggest challenge you're facing.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.280]   From a product standpoint,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.200]   what are you guys doing
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.920]   to help the marketing team solve this?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.480]   And it's like, well, now you get to learn a lot of stuff,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.720]   but it actually shows that you're trying to solve problems.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.000]   You're trying to get more out of it.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.040]   I just try to say as the candidate,
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.800]   don't forget you can ask questions
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.960]   and don't assume that the questions you ask
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.400]   are purely selfish.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.600]   They can often leave people with a better impression of you
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.840]   and not just be information gathering.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.680]   - So I have a TikTok account for my podcast.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.760]   It's called Lenny's Podcast on TikTok.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.400]   And I think it's like, my name is the actual handle.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.080]   And the most popular content is guests talking
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.840]   about their favorite interview question.
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.800]   I ask that often at the end of my podcast episodes.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.640]   And so if you're looking for more questions to practice on,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   if you go to Lenny's Podcast on TikTok,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.960]   you'll sort, I think by views,
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.840]   you can probably see a bunch
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.560]   of really fun interview questions.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.960]   - I will link to that in the show notes
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.240]   so people can find it.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.760]   Now, let's say you get the job.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.400]   This is something I know you've written about.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.840]   And I know it was actually a guest post,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.640]   but I'm hoping you have some of the takeaways
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:18.400]   because they were fantastic about salary negotiation.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.560]   I think it's something that people spend far less time on
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.400]   than they should.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.680]   And you highlighted a lot of that
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.600]   in the post you put out on your newsletter.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.080]   - Yeah, this post ended up being the most popular post
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.560]   of my newsletter of all time,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.000]   partly 'cause it got on Hacker News and got a ton of views
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.040]   and some recruiters did not like it.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.800]   And it's good and bad, but I learned a ton from it.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.200]   So the author's Nia Drugova.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.000]   And the reason I asked her to write this
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.080]   is because I'm really bad at negotiation.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.600]   I don't even know if I've ever negotiated a salary.
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.920]   And so I wanted to learn how to do this well.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.640]   And her full-time job basically
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.660]   is helping candidates negotiate their offers.
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.760]   And help them find jobs.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.720]   So she's done this a ton.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.160]   There's 10 kind of steps that she shares.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.120]   I'll share a few highlights,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.440]   things that I thought were most interesting.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.200]   One is she super recommends you never give a number
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.560]   of what you think your salary should be
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.200]   or the range you're thinking about.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.880]   Here's the question she suggests you ask.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.940]   Can you tell me the salary band for this level?
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.040]   I'm happy to let you know if it's within my range
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.960]   and we can discuss the specific number later
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.040]   once I've met the team.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.240]   That's her advice.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.960]   And that range ends up being really useful later
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.840]   when you start to negotiate.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.340]   That's tip one.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.920]   Tip two is to mine for intel
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.800]   from your hiring manager and the recruiter
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.400]   into what they're looking for from this role.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.160]   Like what's the number one priority of the team right now?
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.900]   Why is this role open?
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.120]   What's the biggest challenge
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.880]   for someone getting into this role?
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.760]   And the reason this is important
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   is then you can mirror that back
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.920]   when you're pitching yourself.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.260]   Once you've got an offer you wanna counter,
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.260]   you can highlight,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.320]   hey, here's what I'm gonna help you with.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.720]   Here's what I'm gonna do in this role.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.460]   Here's the challenges I'm gonna tackle immediately.
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.300]   And people are gonna be like,
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.760]   holy moly, that's exactly what we need.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.680]   How did you know?
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.200]   So the tip there is just mine.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.120]   Like ask these questions so that you can have notes
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.980]   when you're actually pitching yourself later.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.800]   And then the third tip that I love is
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.360]   once you get an offer,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.080]   her advice is don't counter it immediately
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.920]   and don't come back with,
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.940]   no, I think this is a better, more fair number.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.340]   Instead you wanna win the hearts and minds
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.800]   of the decision makers.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.240]   You want them to feel like,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.440]   oh my God, we need Chris in this company.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.360]   We gotta pay him whatever he wants.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.600]   And her advice is after you get the offer,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.720]   try to get a meeting with a decision maker,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.520]   like a director or VP or something.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   Just like, hey, I just wanna chat about this role.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.320]   In the discussion,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.880]   ask questions about how they would want you
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.200]   to create meaningful impact.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.920]   Share some ideas maybe you've had
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.840]   about what you're gonna do there.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.920]   And then maybe share obstacles that you have
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.460]   in accepting the offer and taking on the role.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.220]   And try to get them excited about you joining the company.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.740]   And with that, then you can come back with like,
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.660]   okay, I've talked to everyone.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.020]   I understand the role better.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.260]   Here's where I think the offer should be.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.900]   And in theory, if you got them really excited,
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.140]   they'd be like, oh yeah, yes, yes, yes.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.460]   Let's do whatever we need to do.
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.000]   So those are some nuggets.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.380]   - I love that third tip.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.260]   It's almost like come up with a plan.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.220]   You could even talk to the person that would be your manager
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.580]   and be like, hey,
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.780]   I know we're talking about salary negotiation already,
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.960]   but I just wanna figure out like, what's the 90-day plan?
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.340]   What can I hit the ground running on?
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.880]   And you get them to like buy into,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.240]   this is what this person's gonna do.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.080]   And they're like, gosh,
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.920]   we've already decided their first project.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.760]   Can we get going?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.800]   - Right, like get them in the hell, let's get going.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.640]   What are we doing?
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.080]   - Yeah. - Negotiating over here.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.000]   - My other piece of advice to people is,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.560]   salary is a component of your compensation,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.440]   but there's often a lot of flexibility in other places.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.600]   So it's not the only place to focus on.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   Some companies, things like vacation days are flexible.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.260]   Some they're just based on tenure or everyone gets the same.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.380]   Some educational reimbursement is one
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.420]   that you can focus on.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.740]   Others, I've found companies that say,
[00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:55.020]   we're not really willing to flex on the salary,
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.360]   but I've heard from after I've worked there
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.940]   that they are willing to flex on a signing bonus.
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.400]   They are willing to flex on various other aspects
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.060]   of compensation, like what your estimated bonus is.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.700]   I helped a friend negotiate.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.460]   He said, sometimes it's like,
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.040]   oh, well now I know the band for the level,
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.500]   but could I be at the next level?
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.460]   And I'm not trying to tell you how much to pay me.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.140]   I'm trying to tell you that I'm at the next level.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.540]   And they said, well, we're not confident
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.420]   you're at that level.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.420]   And he said, great, how about we have a check-in
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   in six months and you tell me what I need to demonstrate.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.700]   I will demonstrate that.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:28.580]   And if I will, would you retroactively update my compensation
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.340]   as if I came in at that level?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.880]   If you're not willing to believe I'm there now,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.180]   let me prove it to you.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.460]   And he set out a series of things
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.180]   that they needed to demonstrate.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.360]   Three months in, he checked in with them and said,
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.420]   am I on track to demonstrate these things?
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.220]   Which by the way, genius move for this person
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.180]   because it's so much easier for your manager
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.100]   to say you're on track for something
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.620]   than actually getting your promotion put through
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.940]   or getting your compensation adjusted.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.380]   But then when you check in six months later and you say,
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.300]   three months ago, you said I was on track.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.860]   Like we haven't had any conversation to the contrary.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.300]   If I'm not getting this, then why were you telling me that?
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.860]   Similar to how you said getting the buy-in
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.540]   before you negotiate, you're getting the buy-in
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.180]   that you're already gonna get approved for this change.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.860]   So I just think there's a lot of wiggle room
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.740]   about things other than your salary.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.100]   And if a company's not willing to flex there,
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.380]   go down all the other paths.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.360]   - Still so hard to do this negotiation thing.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.240]   - I kind of love negotiating.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.580]   I worked with Andy Ratcliffe for a while.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.420]   He was the CEO of Wealthfront.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.100]   His advice was to always just put the decision
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.540]   in someone else's hand and say, what do you think is fair?
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.140]   He said 90% of the time they do what's fair
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.500]   and 10% of the time they don't.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.780]   And you know that they're trying to kind of screw you over
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.180]   and maybe that's just not the right fit.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.760]   I always like sharing negotiation advice,
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.380]   even if it's not relevant to salary,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.520]   but you could basically say,
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.420]   here's all the data I've collected
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.060]   about what this role should be compensated.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.980]   I'd like to be compensated fairly with this data.
[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.900]   Here's the data, let me know what you think.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.580]   And like force it on them to make a fair decision,
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:54.980]   depending on the circumstance,
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.900]   a good last tactic or a starting point.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.900]   But I like and have used many times the tactic
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.740]   of letting someone else decide what's fair
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.340]   and not have to throw out the number first.
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.980]   - I like it.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.340]   - I wanna tell you all about the most amazing way
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.720]   to buy a second home.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.740]   And I know because we actually bought one
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.580]   for 1/8 the cost.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.700]   And don't worry, I'm not talking timeshares,
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.340]   I'm talking about Picasso,
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.860]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:19.820]   So how does it work?
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.200]   Picasso buys amazing luxury homes
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.700]   in over 40 world-class destinations,
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.700]   creates an LLC for each home,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.740]   and you can buy as little as 1/8 of the property.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:31.060]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.940]   Picasso also professionally manages the home,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.940]   handling design, cleaning, bills, repairs, taxes, and more.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.880]   And the scheduling system makes it fair and equitable
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.160]   for everyone to enjoy their home.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.840]   When we found Picasso, it felt like it was made just for us.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.960]   That same week, we found the perfect place in Napa,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   we toured it, and the next week we were closing.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.340]   Since then, it's truly become our second home,
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.960]   and it's been so amazing.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.240]   And it's true real estate ownership.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.640]   Owners can sell at any time, set their own price,
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.940]   and tap into Picasso's active marketplace of buyers.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:11.120]   In fact, on average, Picasso listings resell in 12 days
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.480]   with a 12% annualized gain.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.720]   For a modern way to buy and own a second home,
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.800]   go to allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.320]   where our listeners will get a free Picasso access account,
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.000]   which means you can see new listings
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.800]   before they go on the website
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.880]   and get up to $10,000 in credit towards closing costs.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/picasso,
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.420]   P-A-C-A-S-S-O.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.260]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.800]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.680]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.740]   So, kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.680]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.640]   and let our sponsor Drizly,
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:00.360]   the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.160]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.020]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.440]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.400]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.880]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.960]   that you got through another week.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.060]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.600]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.360]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.460]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.120]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.680]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.700]   So, when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.540]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.600]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.240]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.720]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:41.360]   So, whatever the occasion,
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.640]   download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.680]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.900]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.800]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.280]   and supporting the show.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.120]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.840]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.600]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.160]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.400]   So, please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.020]   Okay, so we've gotten hired.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:14.460]   We're now at a company,
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.360]   and I wanna focus on something that applies to everyone,
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.920]   actually working at the company they're at.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.320]   There is a lot we could cover here.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.780]   I don't wanna go through every possible thing,
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.660]   but there are a few things that I think you might have
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.280]   outsized impact on the conversation about,
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.260]   and the first one is actually about having impact
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.200]   in an organization, and hopefully a little bit
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.920]   about how to get promoted on the way,
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.620]   but I know you believe those two things
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.600]   are both similar and very different.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.400]   So, what do you think people should be optimizing for
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.860]   when they're working at any company?
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.040]   - If I had to pick one thing,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.240]   I would say have impact on the company
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.360]   in their bottom line.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.200]   If you think about it like,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.580]   why the hell are they paying you a salary?
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.320]   It's to have impact on their business,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.400]   to help them grow faster.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.240]   And so, if there's any one thing
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.160]   that you can just always come back to,
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.360]   if you deliver more impact, you will do better.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.300]   That's like 90% of your success at a company.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.960]   Then there's like, people need to know about your impact.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.640]   You need to be working on things that matter.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.080]   Like, you could have an impact on a leaf
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.040]   at the end of the tree of the business,
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.760]   or you could have impact on the core number one goal,
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.740]   and that's a big difference,
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.120]   but I'd say if you had to pick anything,
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.360]   it's just how can I deliver more impact?
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.960]   And it's especially important for PMs
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.040]   who are basically marshaling the resources of their team.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.400]   And the more you focus on how can our team have more impact,
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.080]   the better everyone on the team does.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.600]   - Let's pretend you just started a new company.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.660]   How do you find the way you can have that impact?
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.720]   - I think about Lord of the Rings and the Eye of Sauron.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.560]   If you think about like,
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.920]   what's the most important project to the CEO right now?
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.640]   I think about that as the Eye of Sauron.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.720]   He's looking at that, or she's looking at that,
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.600]   and that's gonna be like so stressful and difficult.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.000]   You're like right on you, on your butt.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.400]   And then the alternative is you could be working in a shire
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.760]   where nobody cares what's going on.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.840]   Like you could have the most amazing product
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   and everyone's like, that's nice, good job.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.040]   I would say generally you wanna optimize on average
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.920]   to be like not in the Eye of Sauron,
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.320]   but right off to the side.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.120]   Work on something that's really important,
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.680]   but not like the most important thing to the company,
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.560]   at least for a long time,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.320]   because you just get burned out being in that thing
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.880]   that's like the number one most important product.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.680]   So that's just like a general piece of advice.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.960]   Work on something really important,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.200]   but maybe not the most important thing.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.720]   Just a tip there.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.800]   And then in terms of just like,
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.040]   how do you find what the most important thing?
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.680]   Like it's pretty clear usually.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.800]   It's like what's getting resourced?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.320]   What are the execs really excited about?
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.280]   Where are the best people going?
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.320]   Those sorts of things, like what's being prioritized?
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.760]   - Impact's the most important thing.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.480]   I've seen you write about how to get promoted effectively,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.680]   and that impact matters.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.120]   Any comments on that?
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.800]   - Yeah, if you're like, why am I not getting promoted?
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.000]   It usually means that you're not delivering enough impact
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.400]   or people don't have confidence that you will deliver
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.840]   the impact that you need to at a higher level.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.760]   So if you think about working backwards
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.120]   from a hiring manager or the company,
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.560]   thinking about, should we promote Chris?
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.040]   Basically, you need to give them confidence
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.840]   that you can handle more scope,
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.480]   more responsibility, more impact.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   So how do you show that?
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.400]   One, deliver more impact.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.440]   Find ways to hit more ambitious goals,
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.480]   maybe lead a really important project,
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.840]   work on something closer to the eye of Sauron,
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.480]   something higher visibility and more important,
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.800]   maybe help the company save money or run more efficiently,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.200]   just like find ways where you can show
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.720]   that you've done things that are really important
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.560]   to the company.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.400]   So that's one.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.480]   Two is, part of the idea of our promotion
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.720]   is people are gonna give you more scope,
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.600]   more responsibility, and again,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.520]   they have to have confidence that you can handle it.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.360]   How do you do that?
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.240]   You take on more scope, more responsibility
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.160]   before you are promoted to show people,
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.200]   look at me, I can handle this.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.280]   So you wanna find ways to take on
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.640]   work maybe your manager's doing.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.040]   And knock it out, take on a project
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.440]   that someone else is doing while they're out
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.880]   and do it for them.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.880]   Pick a really ambitious project
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.440]   that's just gonna take a year or two
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.120]   that's gonna be really important to the company.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.600]   Take the reins on like a visioning exercise
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.320]   and just like, look at me, I did this thing,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   this is awesome.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.240]   I think what's important here is a lot of people
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.960]   only get promoted after they've shown
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.120]   they can handle this additional scope.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.320]   And so you gotta find opportunities to take on more scope.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.960]   There's five more, and it's posted around,
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.560]   so let me just run through them pretty quick.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.200]   Three is part of the reason you're getting promoted
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.040]   is there's this gap that your manager has identified.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.560]   Like Chris needs to work on better deadline setting
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.440]   or hiring.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.280]   There's usually like a gap
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.680]   that keeps you from the next level.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.120]   And it's really important
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.720]   that you and your manager are aligned.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.120]   Here's the gaps that keep you from the next level.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.880]   Like you shared this story about your friend.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.520]   Am I on track for this next level?
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   There's usually like a set of things
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.360]   that your manager gives you feedback on,
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.480]   usually in your performance review.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.120]   A tip that I would suggest that I found really powerful,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.200]   either as a manager or as a report,
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.120]   is when you have a performance review,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.760]   align with your manager on like a spreadsheet of things
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.840]   that you plan to do in the next, say, six months
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.080]   until the next performance review.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   Create basically a roadmap.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.960]   Like I'm gonna work on becoming a better public speaker.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.000]   I am gonna hit deadlines 90% of the time.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.960]   I'm gonna update our JIRA to be up to date
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.280]   by the end of Fridays.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.040]   Just make a list of the things you can actually do
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.840]   that'll bring you to the next level.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.200]   And then meet with your manager/report every month
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.200]   and review the status of each of those things.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.720]   It becomes this little roadmap where you're aligned on,
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.280]   here's the things, say, Chris is working on
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.400]   and how they're going.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.560]   So that by the time you get to performance review,
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.400]   you're not surprised.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.840]   Like here, we did five of these things.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.560]   We didn't get to these things.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.920]   So that's where you're at.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.040]   So demonstrate you've addressed a gap.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.400]   Four, find someone that can champion you.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.000]   That's often really powerful at a company.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.920]   Get someone really excited about you
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.240]   and can champion you inside these calibration sessions.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.080]   That's really powerful.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.280]   Five is you wanna pay attention
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.320]   to what gets promoted at the company.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.400]   A lot of companies have these gray area things
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.320]   that matter a lot that you may not be aware of.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.720]   So just look at people who are getting promoted.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.880]   Look for things that they're doing maybe
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.000]   that you're not doing.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.480]   Maybe you have to be friends with the CEO.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.320]   I don't know.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.120]   Maybe you have to be really good at communication.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.480]   That really matters at the company.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.320]   And then two more.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.440]   Something that's way underappreciated
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.120]   is you just need to ask to get promoted sometimes.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.640]   Sometimes managers don't know you wanna be promoted.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.720]   So simplest thing you could do is just like,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.400]   hey, I would love to be promoted to the next level.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.920]   What do I need to do to get there?
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.240]   What are my gaps?
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.360]   And that often leads to the biggest impact
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.880]   on getting promoted.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   And then the last idea and tip is just
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:25.800]   sometimes you need to leave and work somewhere else.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.760]   Sometimes you're just like stuck in a rut
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.680]   and you just have, I don't know, certain reputation.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.080]   Your manager is just not good at championing you.
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.840]   So sometimes you're not gonna get promoted
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.880]   and it's time to try some other place
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.360]   where you kind of start with a clean slate.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.600]   - I remember it was so depressing,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.760]   but when I was a venture capitalist,
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.680]   the role of non-general partner,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.920]   we were told it was like, this is a terminal position.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.280]   They were just very transparent.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.360]   They were like, the expectation for this job
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.840]   is not that you will get promoted
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.640]   to be a general partner of the fund.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.760]   That is just how it works.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.480]   And we just want you to know that
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.920]   so you don't have those expectations.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.680]   And it was like very clearly set.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.080]   I think it was a little depressing at times
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.320]   'cause the word terminal position
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.360]   just sounds like going nowhere.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.080]   But I appreciate the honesty.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.760]   I appreciate the transparency.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.040]   The one thing that I learned
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.920]   and you reminded me in what you said
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.240]   was a lot of times in order to get promoted,
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.600]   you don't need to meet the expectations of your role.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.360]   You need to demonstrate that you can handle the next role.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.840]   And I think I'd always thought
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.280]   as someone who hasn't studied this
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.160]   or been a prolific manager at any point in time,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.000]   I always thought, oh,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.360]   when someone could do their job really well,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.720]   you move to the next level.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.400]   But it's actually in a lot of companies,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.800]   it's when someone could demonstrate
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.720]   that they can do the job that they want to get promoted to
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   is when that happens.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.480]   And so it's really important to understand
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:42.520]   if I'm a level five manager
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.120]   and I wanna be a level six director,
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.560]   it's like, what do I need to demonstrate to be a director?
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.000]   Not what do I need to do as a manager?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.600]   Because sometimes you need to do the next level's job
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.560]   to get the promotion.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.160]   - Yeah, and that's how it works in calibration.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.800]   When you're looking at someone's level,
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.520]   there's like a lot of big companies have these ladders
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.400]   and they tell you what each level needs to achieve.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.040]   And so if someone's gonna be promoted to say L7,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.480]   there's like, here's what L7 has to be good at
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.640]   in each of these things.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.760]   And that's what managers look at,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.600]   is Chris ready for all these things in L7?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.160]   It makes sense, like your job is gonna now be that.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.360]   You wanna be confident that they can handle that.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.480]   - And if that ladder is not public, ask for it.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.080]   There are some companies that might not publish it
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.600]   on any internal doc, but you could say,
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.800]   hey, to my boss, could you please show me
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.600]   the career ladder for my role
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.040]   or could the requirements of the next level of my role?
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.360]   And hopefully you can get that and understand it
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.480]   so you can work towards it.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.520]   - I've actually collected the career ladders
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.680]   at 20 something companies
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.880]   and I have this doc that has all their level names
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.560]   and then the attributes for product managers specifically
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.640]   that they look for to promote people.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.480]   - That's awesome.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:45.960]   We'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.080]   One of the things I tell people
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.480]   is they think that to be promoted,
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:52.640]   that strategy is to always do whatever your boss wants
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:53.720]   and never push back.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.120]   I am someone who probably has never adhered to that,
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.280]   maybe to my own demise and pushed back too much.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.960]   What do you think is the right balance of saying no
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.200]   and what's the value of saying no
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.760]   as opposed to always being willing
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.520]   to do what other people want?
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.800]   - I'm thinking from a PM perspective,
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.440]   product manager perspective,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.280]   you're kind of responsible
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.600]   for what a whole team of people does.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.800]   Like you could almost say your job is to say no
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.400]   so that you can say yes to the stuff
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.720]   that is really important.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.800]   So it's really important to say no, to push back.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.760]   It's still very hard, especially if your manager's like,
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.920]   hey, we need to do these things.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.160]   So I wrote this post with five ways you can say no
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.760]   and many of them are you say yes to say no.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.600]   So I'll share some of these quotes that you can steal
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.400]   and they're also in this post.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   So the first two is someone asks you to do something.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.560]   You could say yes, but here's what's gonna have to change.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:46.280]   If we do that, should we move forward?
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.960]   And oftentimes they're like, yes, let's go ahead.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.360]   Or otherwise they're like, no, shoot.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.040]   I don't wanna deprioritize that, forget that.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.720]   So that's one trick.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.480]   Two is you could say yes, but not right now
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.080]   because we gotta stay focused on X because of X, Y, Z.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   Do you agree with that?
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.920]   Or do you think we should deprioritize that?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.240]   So that often works really well
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.720]   'cause it basically communicates.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.000]   Again, here's like a very clear trade off
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.840]   on why it's important.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.400]   Another way you could say no is no,
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.320]   but how about we do X, Y, Z instead of that?
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.240]   And it's gonna achieve a similar outcome.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.680]   Basically, this is when you have a better idea,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.040]   but you wanna communicate here's something.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.280]   We could basically do exactly what you want,
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.800]   but here's a better approach to doing that.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.840]   Another way you could say no is no,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.680]   but there's something there.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.960]   There's like something to this idea.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.760]   How about we explore this a little bit further
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.440]   and here's the next step that I suggest.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.120]   And then the fifth way you could approach it is just like,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.080]   no, I don't think this is a good idea.
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.920]   Here's why.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.000]   Would you agree or is there something I'm missing?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.920]   - So first off, I wish I had read this post
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.320]   earlier in my career 'cause I was like,
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.280]   no, that's so crazy.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.160]   Why would we do that?
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.480]   Politics is the wrong word,
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.280]   but I was never good at a lot of this stuff.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.360]   And one of the tactics I shared when we spoke on your show
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.840]   was that I was so confrontational about things
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.640]   because I was so used to working at a company
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.800]   that I started where everyone always knew
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.640]   that obviously I was always optimizing for the company
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:11.240]   because it didn't matter.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.800]   And then I joined a company where I wasn't in charge.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.520]   And it turns out that in big companies,
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.640]   there are a lot of people who are optimizing for themselves
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.040]   way more than the company.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.080]   I didn't really realize that.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.200]   I was like, everyone's got to optimize for the company.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.440]   That's the most important thing.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.280]   That's how I lived in my last companies that I've run.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.480]   So a tactic that helped me when I was pushing back
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.520]   on people, colleagues, bosses,
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.920]   is just always making sure that I told people,
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.160]   hey, I'm thinking about this from the perspective
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.560]   of trying to maximize the impact from the company.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.640]   And because sometimes I'd say, oh, we shouldn't do that.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.520]   That's not a good idea.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.360]   And people would be like,
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.520]   oh, well, you just don't want to do more work
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.600]   or you want to focus on this thing
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.680]   you're more excited about.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.400]   And that wasn't true.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.880]   But the more I just transparently said,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.120]   here's how I'm thinking about this.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.360]   Here's what I'm focused on.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.720]   It just helped so much.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.320]   So just stating your intent before you push back
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.720]   so people know where you're coming from
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.040]   was very helpful for me
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.680]   and hopefully helpful for some others.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.120]   - Yeah, I think we all fall into this.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.320]   Like people are going to read our mind
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.840]   and know exactly why we think no or why we're saying this.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.600]   And it turns out people cannot.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.640]   - So real quick, before we talk about what happens
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.400]   when you move on from a job,
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.360]   part of getting things done is being productive.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.240]   I've talked a lot about time management.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.080]   I'm a nerd.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   We don't have to go super deep
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.720]   'cause I've done a few episodes,
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.840]   but any few tactics you want to pull out
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.200]   on how you manage your time and get a lot done
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.680]   and be effective with your output
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.080]   so that you do have impact?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.240]   - Yeah, and it's especially important
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.520]   in this world of writing and podcasting.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.200]   I'll share a few things that worked really well
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.920]   when I was working full-time.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.720]   And I don't think anything will be revolutionary,
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.840]   but these things really work for me at least.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.080]   One is I blocked three hours on Monday, Wednesdays,
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.560]   and Fridays on my calendar.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.560]   And I called the meeting,
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.280]   "Do not book or I will slap you."
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.680]   And it made people laugh, but it really worked really well.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.400]   People did not book over these slots.
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.880]   They were like, "Okay, I get it."
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.440]   And so find some funny way to have a block
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.240]   where people know, "Okay, I see.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.920]   "He's really serious about this time.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.440]   "Let me leave him alone."
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.360]   Because I'm sure you've talked about deep work
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.280]   and the importance of focus and all that,
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.200]   but I find that that's so important for creative work.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.480]   In my new life of newsletter or podcast person,
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.880]   I have no meetings until 3 p.m., that's my rule.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.160]   And only at 3, I have meetings and things like this.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:20.680]   So that helps a ton.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.120]   Two is just, what's an app or something
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:26.000]   that keeps you focused when you're working?
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.960]   I use this app called Centered.app.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.840]   That's kind of like Brain.fm,
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.360]   which is this like binaural beat music,
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.760]   meets a to-do list, meets like a playlist.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.920]   So once you're ready to work, you click play
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.240]   and music starts and it's like,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   "Lenny, start with your newsletter posts."
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.360]   And then you can knock them off
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.400]   as you're working through them.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.720]   And it works really well for me.
[00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.000]   Something I'm trying right now that works well
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   is picking one highlight of the day,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.760]   one top goal for the day.
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:51.920]   There's this book I'm reading right now
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.240]   called "Make Time."
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.560]   - Oh yeah, John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.760]   - Yeah, sprint guys.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.880]   And that's one of their key things.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.840]   Just like pick a highlight.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.400]   What's gonna be like a highlight of your day
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.480]   that you look back on?
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.720]   That I did this thing, you'll feel good
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.200]   no matter what else happened.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.040]   So I'm trying to do that
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.000]   and that's been working really well.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.520]   Another tip is to have a waiting for list.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.340]   It's very like getting things done, David Allen style,
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.280]   where I have all these open threads of people doing stuff.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:20.160]   And I keep a list of who am I waiting for on these things
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.880]   so that the to-do, even though it's on someone else's plate,
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.160]   I don't lose track of.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.640]   And the way I do it is in my to-do list,
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.720]   I just have W for Chris
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.760]   and then it's like record podcast or whatever.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.640]   So that ends up being really helpful.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.440]   The other interesting thing I find is procrastination
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.760]   has a bad rap.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.240]   I find that sometimes I procrastinate on a hard thing,
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.640]   but I get a lot of other smaller things done.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.680]   So I like work through this list of stuff
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.280]   that isn't important, but I get them done.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.120]   And there's value to just procrastinating off the thing
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.400]   that's like really hard
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.520]   because you still get other stuff done.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.000]   So I try to channel my procrastination
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   and get stuff done that I need to get done anyway.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.280]   That ends up being kind of interesting.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.760]   - I love using the word flow state.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.920]   There's deep work.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.600]   And I don't know if you could say flow state
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.200]   and deep work are the same thing,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.280]   but I think that sometimes it just takes
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   a little bit of momentum to get into that flow state.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.040]   So it's like, I got this really big, hard thing.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.160]   Do I want to sit down and do all this research?
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.400]   Or do I want to knock off a few quick things?
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.080]   And then I'm like, oh yeah, I'm making progress.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:21.480]   I just cleaned up this set of my emails.
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.960]   I just got this one thing done
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.360]   and now I'm feeling really productive.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.400]   And at least for me, once I start feeling productive,
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.560]   it's just so much easier to be more productive
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.400]   and get more done.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.640]   And then I find myself like,
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.920]   oh, I just wish I could work longer.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:33.760]   I've got so much.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.560]   So I love making momentum in that.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.480]   So gosh, those are some really great tips.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   I won't share too many of mine
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.680]   because I've done an episode with Ali Abdaal
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.280]   on productivity, with Cal Newport on deep work
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.160]   and Laura Vanderkam on time management.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.360]   So if you're new here,
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   there's a lot in the archives to go check out.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.840]   So go check those out.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.080]   But let's talk about moving on
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:53.040]   because you said you've left here.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.480]   You're no longer a full-time employee with a company.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.760]   You're doing it on your own.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.320]   How did you even decide maybe I should move on?
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.080]   I'm ready for a big change.
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:02.080]   - If you look at my resume,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.880]   I'm like a serial monogamist of career.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.400]   I worked at my first company for nine years,
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.720]   then at a startup.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.280]   That was the short stint, a year and a half.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.120]   And then worked at Airbnb for seven years.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.440]   I never thought I'd stay there that long.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.600]   They bought our startup and I'm like,
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.640]   ah, I'm going to be out of here in three years
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.880]   when I'm going to start another company.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.240]   And then seven years later, here I am.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.000]   And along the way, I thought about leaving,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.920]   but it never felt like it was time.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.640]   It was always interesting.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.600]   There's always reasons to keep working there
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.760]   and try new stuff.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.440]   And the way that it happened that I left
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.560]   is they gave me a sabbatical.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.360]   So I took three months off
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.880]   right around when I was reaching seven years.
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.760]   And about halfway through,
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.800]   I remember just opening my email for the first time.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.720]   So a month and a half in the work email,
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.240]   just to see what was going on.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.320]   And I just had this like heart sinking feeling
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.040]   where I'm like, I don't care about this at all anymore.
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:55.280]   What the heck is, what is going on here?
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.240]   I don't want to think about any of this ever again.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.880]   And so that was kind of an important moment
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.760]   where I was like, wow,
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.720]   maybe I'm not excited about this work anymore.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.000]   I still came back to Airbnb after that
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.840]   and kind of wanted to feel out.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.800]   Am I ready for some new,
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:11.080]   is there like a new team maybe I could work on,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.120]   new project that would get me excited?
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.160]   But basically the way it felt is I got there
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:19.120]   and I immediately felt like my heart was done with that work,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.600]   but my brain wasn't ready to move on.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.040]   It was like, maybe there's something more interesting.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:22.920]   Maybe there's a new manager.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:24.280]   Maybe there's something else I could work on.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.920]   So I took a month basically to think and talk to people
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.720]   about other roles, other teams, other opportunities.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.000]   But I'd say at the end of the month,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.720]   it was like, nope, nothing that gets me very excited.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:36.040]   It's time to do some new.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.560]   And we'll say, it's like very fortunate
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.600]   to be able to have that feeling of like,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.280]   I can leave and I'm not going to go bankrupt
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.480]   and have to live on the street.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.440]   So I'm grateful that I have the opportunity
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.080]   to even have thought that, but I did.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.920]   And so what I decided to do is I'm going to leave Airbnb
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.160]   and I'm going to give myself six months
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.560]   to think about what I want to do next.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.640]   And something that really helped there,
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.000]   and here's a tip if you ever think about something like this,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.600]   is to figure out a personal runway
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.840]   of like how much it's going to cost you
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.280]   to take six months off and just budget that.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.320]   Like it's going to be $30,000 to take six months off,
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.920]   to pay all the things I'm paying.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.760]   And just knowing that number ahead of time
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   gives you so much less stress,
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.280]   knowing like burning through money as I'm not working,
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.400]   but I've already accounted for that.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.000]   And it's like maybe sitting in a bank account somewhere
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.920]   and that gives you more freedom to just explore
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:21.760]   and not have to worry about,
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.160]   oh my God, I need to find something as soon as possible.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.960]   - And I'll just highlight the importance
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.160]   of actually putting it in an account.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.000]   It's one thing to be like,
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.920]   well, I know I have enough savings to take time off.
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.120]   And this is something that I'm actively thinking about
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.440]   now that I'm creating this business on my own,
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.360]   just like you did.
[00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.200]   It's like actually putting it somewhere.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.400]   It takes it one step further.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   'Cause a lot of it's emotional.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.760]   It's not always rational.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.360]   It's like, gosh, I don't have a salary coming in.
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:50.000]   I almost went as far as to take the salary,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.480]   put it in a bank account and automate the transfers.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.640]   So it like simulated as if I was getting my paycheck
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.840]   so that I felt like it was not as scary
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.520]   to not have that stability.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.360]   - No, that was great.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.280]   The other thing that I found really powerful
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.440]   during this time, in addition to the personal runway,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:09.520]   is there's so little structure when you aren't working.
[00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.680]   Like I worked for, I think, 19 years,
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.040]   since like, you know, 18 years old.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.360]   And I never take a break.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.600]   And it's so weird to not have structure in your life.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.720]   There's no deadlines.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.200]   There's no like, I need to achieve this thing by then.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.640]   Like you could work all day, you could not work at all.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.920]   Nobody's gonna say anything.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.700]   And it's hard to work without that.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.960]   Like it feels like it shouldn't be, but it really is.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.760]   So what I did is I created structure for myself.
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.440]   And the way I did that is I created these little sprints
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.520]   where every two weeks I wrote down,
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.440]   here's the three goals I have for the next two weeks
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.840]   that are work goals and three personal goals.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.440]   And I emailed that to three friends
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.880]   that became kind of this like personal board of directors
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.960]   kind of group.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.720]   And I had no expectation they'd reply.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.920]   I didn't need them to reply.
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.760]   I just found that just emailing them,
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.160]   here's what I'm trying to accomplish.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.120]   And then circling back in two weeks and sharing,
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.800]   here's how I did, created so much accountability
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.760]   and gave me some focus for these two weeks.
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.320]   And I ended up doing that for a year straight
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.360]   every two weeks.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.680]   I did a little check-in in one weekend
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.680]   just to like, here's how it's going so far per sprint.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.280]   And that was so powerful and important
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.200]   to where I ended up just creating a little bit of structure.
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.480]   And that email list ended up being like 30 people
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.880]   eventually just 'cause it became a cool way
[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.920]   to update my friends on what I was up to.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.160]   And just like, hey, you wanna join this list I'm doing?
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.960]   So that's a tip if you don't have enough structure
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.360]   around your free time.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.240]   - I do not yet.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.720]   And I'm going to adopt that tip.
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.040]   - I will send you the template.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.200]   It's so simple and easy and so powerful.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.120]   - Maybe I'll make a Google doc, just a template one
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.760]   if you don't mind and we could just share it with everyone.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.600]   - Let's do it.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   - Put it in the show notes. - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.600]   - I think one thing interesting
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.040]   that I've thought a lot about recently
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.400]   is as a creator, which you left and you started,
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:47.520]   I think the first thing out of Airbnb was a newsletter.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:48.680]   I think a lot of people are kind of scared.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:49.960]   I don't know what my thing is,
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.280]   but I love the idea of experimenting with creation.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.160]   And I think depending on the company you work at,
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.560]   you might be able to experiment before you leave.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.840]   I would encourage everyone to get it cleared
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.240]   to make sure that your company
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.000]   isn't gonna own whatever you're working on.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.840]   Clear that, don't do it on your work computer,
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.240]   do it on your personal computer and all those good things.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.720]   I think one thing for me that was strange
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.120]   was I had all this knowledge about optimization,
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.680]   but it didn't really click
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:16.080]   that it could actually be a thing that I do
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:19.960]   that could be a business that could be how I spend my days.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.200]   Do you have any advice for someone
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.840]   who hasn't quite figured that out?
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.120]   And they're like, I would love to do that,
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.360]   but I don't know what my thing is
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.000]   or I don't know how I could test if it really is a thing.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.360]   - I think there's two things I'll cover there.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.800]   One is, can you start something while you're at a company?
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.720]   My experience is it's so hard.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.200]   I found that I'm done at the end of the day
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.400]   working at a full-time job, like Airbnb.
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.800]   I'm just like, I have no brain energy left
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.280]   to experiment with writing awesome posts
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.120]   or podcast or anything like that.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.320]   It's very, very hard.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.560]   And I think the advantage folks like you and I have
[00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.320]   that are doing this full-time is,
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.720]   I find there's a strong correlation
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.280]   between quality and time.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.840]   There's a strong correlation between
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.960]   how much time you put into something
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.680]   and the quality of that work.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.160]   And people that have a full-time job
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.800]   are not gonna have as much time as someone like you and I
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.760]   that are doing this full-time.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.040]   And so I think it's just really hard
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.320]   to try something like this for real
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.760]   when you have a full-time job.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.400]   So don't feel weird if like, oh my God,
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.880]   everyone's writing all these side projects
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.000]   and writing things and starting podcasts.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.040]   Like very, very hard.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.560]   And I started writing,
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.160]   like I hadn't really written anything public in my life
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.760]   before I started this newsletter, just experiment with it.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.440]   And to segue to the second question is like,
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.680]   how did I discover this path?
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.640]   I just had like stuff I wanted to get out of my head
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.120]   when I left Airbnb, just to make sure I don't forget it
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.080]   in case I start another company.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.640]   And so I just started, I wrote a Medium post,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.320]   it did shockingly well.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.040]   I wrote a few more posts, they did well.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.240]   In the sprint goal thing that I talked about,
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.240]   I just had like every sprint, just like,
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.160]   write one more post, see how that goes.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.520]   So I just kept along that path.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.040]   And the whole time I was like, why am I doing this?
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.920]   I thought I was gonna start a company.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.560]   Like, why am I spending time writing?
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.960]   This is such a not, I'm gonna go anywhere.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.400]   Time investing, my wife's like, what are you doing writing?
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.680]   You're not a writer.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.400]   I thought you wanted to start a company.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.440]   Why aren't you spending time on that?
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.080]   And I had this really important conversation
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.920]   with a friend who pointed out,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.680]   okay, you really enjoy this thing.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.920]   People seem to value it.
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.240]   That's like very rare.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.360]   You found like some kind of product market fit.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.080]   Maybe this goes somewhere if you keep at it.
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.760]   And even if there's no way you could ever make money with it,
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.000]   maybe just double down on that
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.200]   and forget the startup stuff for now
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.720]   and just see where it goes.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.920]   And that's exactly what I did.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:30.120]   I just started writing every week,
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.840]   launched a newsletter just to create
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.400]   a little time pressure to post something once a week
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.640]   and did that for nine months every week.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.960]   And then at that point, I'm like, huh,
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.520]   this is still going great, growing fast.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.560]   Maybe I could charge for this.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.000]   I launched the paid plan that went well
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.320]   and I just kept following that path.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.040]   And so it was very one step at a time
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.320]   without any master plan.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.720]   - And you say it just kind of grew.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.560]   How big's the newsletter now?
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.080]   - It's about to hit 300,000 subscribers.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.720]   - Yeah, so it's a massive newsletter.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.920]   - Massive, number one business newsletter on Substack
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.600]   and growing fast.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.520]   I love it.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.920]   It's kind of the core of my work
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.080]   and then the podcast kind of spun out of that.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.760]   - Well, I've enjoyed it thoroughly.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.000]   In fact, in preparation for this interview,
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.120]   I was a little stressed out
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.240]   because I was thinking, gosh, I'm leaving my job,
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.960]   but I really do love building products.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.120]   And I was like scrolling through,
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.080]   trying to like look at all the posts you've written.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.640]   And I was like, gosh, wow,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.520]   I really want to build this impactful project.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.200]   Like I really want to make another roadmap.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.080]   I've got to channel that energy.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   And for everyone listening,
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.400]   now I'm focused on what kinds of products
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.880]   and experiences and communities,
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.560]   all of the things could I build around
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.440]   what I've done with all the hacks.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.680]   So more to come there, but it's been very helpful.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.320]   So thank you for that.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.720]   Before we wrap, anything we missed in this process?
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.200]   I know you've written so many great newsletters.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.640]   So I want to make sure we hit on something
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.920]   that you've thought about.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.120]   - There's something that I thought would be good to share,
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.640]   which is around managing up.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.600]   I find that whenever I tweet about managing up,
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.120]   it's like the most popular tweets ever.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.560]   Clearly people really want to learn
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.280]   how to manage up better.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.520]   And there's one thing that I'll share
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.160]   that I found really effective,
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.680]   which is around how to keep your manager
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.240]   aware of what you're up to.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.960]   There's a lot of value in your manager knowing
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.680]   what's on your mind, what's important to you right now,
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.000]   what can they help with?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.920]   So something that I found to be really powerful
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.840]   is an email that I call the state of me email.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.160]   So it'd be like the state of Lenny email.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.360]   I call it the subject line state of Lenny.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.720]   And in the email, and I email this to my manager
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.520]   every Monday or every Friday, once a week,
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.080]   I write out, here's blockers that I need your help with.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.320]   One, two, three.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.840]   Here are my current priorities.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.000]   One, two, three.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.320]   And then here's what's on my mind in general.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.080]   One, two, three, four, five.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.160]   And then at the end, just like,
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   let me know if there's anything that I can clarify,
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.080]   if you have any questions about anything.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   And I found that one email created so much value
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.320]   because my manager knew what I was up to.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.800]   They could tell me, hey, why are you working on that?
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.280]   They can unblock stuff that I'm blocked by,
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.200]   which a lot of times they don't know
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.680]   that you're blocked by some.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.880]   And then generally there's stuff on your mind.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.720]   Like, hey, I'm thinking about this project.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.600]   This person's thinking about leaving.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.920]   This competitor's doing this thing.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.440]   So just that one email can make a huge dent,
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.480]   and it's really simple.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.200]   Just like blockers, priorities, what's on your mind.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.800]   Send your manager that once a week,
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.200]   and honestly, great things are gonna happen.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.480]   - I said earlier, you don't wanna be
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.200]   always saying yes to your manager,
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.280]   but making your manager's life easier
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.040]   is certainly something that is a very valued
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.280]   attribute of an employee.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.040]   So in making it easier for them
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.120]   to understand everything you're working on,
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.840]   making it easier for them to say,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.080]   I love this email idea.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.800]   It's like, oh, no, actually work on this.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.960]   That will let you have more impact.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.000]   So love it.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.200]   This has been so helpful.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.720]   I wish that some of these things I had taken before,
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.120]   but like I said, I didn't know where I'd be now.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.680]   Who knows where I'll be in 10 years?
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.040]   And certainly many people listening
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.760]   will hopefully get a lot of value out of this
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.240]   and out of the newsletter.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.440]   Before we go, I do wanna ask you,
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.600]   is there a place that you feel like
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:48.400]   you could give some recommendations to people
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.520]   who might find themselves there on,
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.400]   whether it's eating, activities, drinks, something to do?
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.240]   - Sure, I'm not like the guy people go to
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   for advice on what to do in a place,
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.160]   but you gave me a heads up on this question.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.640]   And so here's what I got for you.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.200]   I live in Marin, California, which is north of San Francisco.
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.720]   And so here's a little agenda.
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:07.000]   If you wanna come to Marin,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.680]   I'd say stay at this hotel called Cavallo Point Lodge.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.400]   It's gonna blow your mind.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.080]   Then take a little walk around Sausalito along the water.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.560]   There's this boardwalk that goes along the water.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.960]   Then just grab lunch at a restaurant there.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   There's like these piers
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.240]   with these beautiful seafood restaurants.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.360]   Then take a drive to San Francisco
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.600]   across the Yuletide Bridge.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.280]   There's this art piece called the Woodline in the Presidio
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.520]   that is this like curvy piece of wood
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:34.440]   that you can walk along amongst these huge eucalyptus trees.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   And that's right across the bridge.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.520]   Then you can go to say Fillmore Street or Chestnut
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.620]   in the Marina and get a coffee,
[01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.040]   buy some nice fancy things in some of the nice stores.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.460]   Then I'd say drive back to Marin and maybe to Fairfax,
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.780]   which is further North, rent a mountain bike,
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.080]   find some trails, mountain biking was invented in Fairfax.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.200]   And there's this huge mountain, Mount Tam,
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.560]   there's like a thousand trails you could go along.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.000]   So maybe spend a few hours hiking around Mount Tam,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.880]   sorry, biking around Mount Tam.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.520]   Then have dinner in Fairfax
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.240]   or there's another cute little town, San Anselmo.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.920]   And then head home to your cute little hotel in Sausalito.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.040]   - I love it.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   If you're in Sausalito,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.400]   I'll throw out a recommendation for a place called Fish,
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.500]   which is just like a seafood restaurant on the water.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.460]   - Sweet, there's your lunch spot, great.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.380]   - It meets the requirement of being Bay Area expensive,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.540]   but also delicious.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.860]   So I love that.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:31.220]   And I don't know if you've been
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.460]   to the Mill Valley Lumber Yard.
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.700]   - Oh yeah, the cutest little complex.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:39.100]   - Someone was like, can we meet at this bakery in Mill Valley?
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:40.740]   And I showed up and I was like,
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.700]   this is literally like this quintessential cute little shops
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.340]   and a little flower store and a bakery and a little creperie.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.000]   And so if you need a place to just relax
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.480]   for an hour and a half or two,
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.680]   highly recommend that as a stop in Mill Valley.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.440]   I have not spent much time in Marin,
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.600]   but that place was just an awesome spot.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.560]   - Yeah, it's like very unknown, but so cute.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.120]   And the bakery is called Flower Craft
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   and it's all gluten free.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:05.920]   My wife's got Celiac and so it's her favorite place.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.560]   - Great bakery, awesome.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.420]   Well, before we wrap,
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.000]   where can people go find all of these great newsletters,
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.720]   all the conversations you're having with people,
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.800]   myself included,
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.360]   which depending on whether this comes out at the same time,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.720]   we had a great conversation over there.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.560]   Let everybody know.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.300]   - The hub of all things I do is Lenny'snewsletter.com.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.760]   That's where my newsletter is, my podcast.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.920]   It's designed for anyone that's building product,
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.960]   growing product, mostly product managers, founders,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.840]   designers, engineers, anyone basically working on software.
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.040]   Lenny'snewsletter.com.
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.160]   You could also check out Lenny'spodcast.com.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.600]   It's a newer thing, but doing super well.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.880]   And I'm really proud of it.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:46.320]   So check that out and @LennySan on Twitter.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.640]   - What's the story behind the San?
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.320]   - One of my friends, when I was in high school,
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.680]   just called me Lenny San for some unknown reason
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:52.820]   and I stuck with it.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.340]   I didn't know I was gonna be stuck with that username
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.540]   for the rest of my life, but here we are.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.380]   - Awesome.
[01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:59.320]   All right, thank you so much for being here.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.160]   - My pleasure, Chris.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.000]   Thanks for having me.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.480]   (upbeat music)
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.280]   - I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.040]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.160]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review

[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.440]   questions for me, or just wanna say hi,

[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.760]   That's it for this week.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.000]   I'll see you next week.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.580]   (upbeat music)
