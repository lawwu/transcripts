[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Well, do human technologies threaten God's sovereign reign over humanity?
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.120]   This timely question is raised by Genesis, and the question fittingly arrives from a
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.200]   podcast listener named Noah.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.240]   Noah writes in to ask this, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.480]   In Genesis 11, verses 1 to 9, we are told that God confused man's common language into
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.240]   a bunch of different languages in order to thwart human progress."
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.960]   It sounds like God, who is infinite, was threatened by the unity of finite creatures.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.400]   But how could God ever be threatened by anything man could do, even the whole of humanity united
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.360]   in any endeavor?
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   And is He threatened by our far superior technological advances today?
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.480]   This has never made sense to me.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.200]   Can you explain it?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.600]   Before I try to answer that question, let's get the story in front of us.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   It's a really interesting story, and let's see if it raises the questions that Noah is
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   raising.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.720]   "Now the whole earth," this is Genesis 11, 1 to 6, "Now the whole earth had one language
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.200]   and the same words.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.400]   And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.400]   there.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.320]   And they said to one another, 'Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.'
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.200]   And they had brick for stone and bitumen for mortar.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.720]   And they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.240]   and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   earth.'
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.480]   And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower."
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.120]   That's going to be significant in just a minute.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.000]   "The Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of man had built."
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.480]   I think that's sarcasm.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.400]   This tall tower that's going to reach into the heaven can't even be seen from heaven.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.800]   I love it.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.560]   Verse 6, "The Lord said, 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language,
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.320]   and this is only the beginning of what they will do, and nothing that they propose to
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.720]   do will now be impossible for them.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.360]   Come, let us go down there and confuse their language so that they may not understand one
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.820]   another's speech.'
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.640]   So the Lord dispersed them over all the face of the earth, and they left off building the
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   city.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   Therefore, its name is called Babel because there the Lord confused the language of all
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   the earth, and there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth."
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.440]   Now Noah is asking, it sounds like God was threatened by these humans getting out of
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.200]   hand, and he wonders if God is threatened today by a far superior technology than burning
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.620]   bricks and putting them together with bitumen.
[00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:14.300]   If Noah is asking, does the text teach that there are resident in human nature ingenuities
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:23.120]   and abilities that, left unchecked by God, would frustrate God's purposes and thus vie
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.800]   for the very place of God, there are two ways to answer it.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:37.300]   One, observe that the first point of the text seems to be that this effort on man's part
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.120]   to build a tower with its top in the heavens was ridiculously futile.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   God had to, so to speak, come down in order to see it.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:59.000]   I think the point of the text is man's efforts to compete with God are pathetically weak
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.560]   and futile.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.120]   So the first answer to the question seems to be, even if God doesn't intervene the way
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.600]   he did by confusing the languages, the human race is never going to attain the upper hand
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.560]   over its creator by building its way to God's throne by any technology whatsoever.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   That's the first answer, which I think is implied in the text.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.200]   Second, more important is this, and I think we see it when we ponder the very nature of
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.440]   Noah's question.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.860]   The more I think about this question, the more it sounds like this.
[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:54.640]   Would God be threatened by man and man's ingenuity and man's abilities if God were not God?
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:02.040]   In other words, would God be threatened by man's actions if God could not sovereignly
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.220]   counter man's actions at any time and in any way he pleased?
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.220]   And the answer would be, well, yes, God would be threatened by the glory of man if God were
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.300]   another creature like man, rather than being the all-glorious, all-powerful God.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.560]   But he is God, and so he calmly puts man in his place.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.400]   God is not threatened by any of man's ingenuity or capacities because he can and does frustrate
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.520]   all of them at any moment in any way he please, which is what he did in verse 7.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.400]   He confused the language.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.560]   In other words, the point of the story is precisely that God cannot be threatened by
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.420]   man's designs or actions because God is God.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.920]   God is sovereign over all man's designs and actions.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:07.520]   If man begins to achieve things that God does not want them to achieve, God simply stops
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   them.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.280]   He takes the steps necessary to frustrate their designs.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   That's the point.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.620]   They were taking steps to do things that were highly damaging to the human soul and highly
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.440]   dishonoring to God, and so God just stopped them.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.200]   And he could have stopped them in a hundred ways.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   Goodness gracious!
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   They could have gotten sick.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   There could have been opposition.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.200]   I mean, goodnight.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:38.240]   A hundred ways he could have stopped them, and he chose to do it by confusing their language.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.960]   So there are two answers to whether God is threatened today by the amazing technology
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.640]   and ability of the human race.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:55.280]   First, no, he's not threatened because all our most advanced technology is simply child's
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.320]   play as far as God is concerned.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:09.040]   Our most advanced physics and artificial intelligence is a kindergarten primer in God's library
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   at best.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.040]   Let's get a life, right?
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.560]   We're talking about God here.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:24.480]   Second, no, he is not threatened because at any moment in a hundred ways, he can simply
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.080]   thwart the plans of science, business, technology, nations.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.840]   That's what Psalm 3310 says.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.560]   The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   He frustrates the plans of the peoples, and that would apply to all science, all business,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   all education, all technology, all industry, all military.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.560]   The Lord brings the counsel of man to nothing.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   He frustrates the plans of the peoples.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.920]   Now both of these answers, I think, are implied in Genesis 11.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:08.280]   The great achievement of the tower is pathetic in God's eyes, and he can frustrate any pathetic
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.320]   human plan he please.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.480]   That bit human little element is so prominent in the story, those bricks put together with
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.160]   tar is such a rare building process.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.660]   You have to wonder if that was preparation for a second global flood.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.240]   If he does it again, we'll be safe.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.880]   The tower is going to be waterproof.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   It can't be washed away.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.080]   It's almost like a man-made arc.
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.000]   I don't know why else that bit human is so prominent in the story.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.480]   Yeah, and the bricks are burned until they become like concrete.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.640]   Yes, this thing is waterproof.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.400]   This thing will not be washed away when it happens again.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.360]   Second man-made arc of source.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.440]   Thank you, Pastor John and Noah.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.360]   Thank you for the great question.

[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   Well is it wise for a girlfriend and boyfriend to travel together, to stay in the same hotel?
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.580]   Should they?
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.600]   It's a question we get regularly, and it's next up on Wednesday.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.040]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.600]   We'll see you then.
