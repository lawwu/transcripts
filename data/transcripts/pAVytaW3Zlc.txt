[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   It seems like every week we get emailed this question, "How do I find a good local church?"
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.240]   And we finally address the question today in the form of an email from an anonymous
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.240]   woman.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   "Dear Pastor John, thanks be to God for your ministry and glory be to Him for your faithfulness
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.680]   and helpful insight on this podcast.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.440]   Here is my situation.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   I moved to a new city and there are wonderfully a number of doctrinally faithful churches
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.400]   in my area of town.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   It's a great problem to have, I know.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.080]   If you were in my situation, how would you narrow down these good options?
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.240]   I don't want to make a decision based merely on my preferences, but what role do preferences
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   make in a church decision like mine?"
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.960]   Let's take that last question first.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.480]   In general, I would say preferences, by which I assume she means tastes that don't have
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.840]   any direct biblical mandate behind them.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.800]   These preferences can be a legitimate part of your decision to the degree that they are
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.120]   shaped and formed by the Word of God, even if not mandated, shaped, and to the degree
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.480]   that they don't take precedence over more important things.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.760]   And by such preferences, I mean things like a small church versus big, meditative versus
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:34.680]   exuberant, formal versus casual, traditional versus contemporary, organ versus guitar,
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.920]   pews versus chairs, 10 o'clock service versus 11, evening service, no evening service, and
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.680]   on and on and on.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.560]   We all have our preferences on such things, and if they're shaped by the Word of God and
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.720]   they're subordinate to more important biblical things, then it would be okay, I think, for
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.080]   them to guide you as part of your decision-making process.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:11.040]   So let me go away to the more important things and mention nine steps that you might take
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.720]   in searching for a home church.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.240]   This is not just your situation.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.800]   I'm thinking maybe more broadly, but I think it'll apply to your situation as well.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.920]   Number one, pray earnestly, Psalm 25.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.720]   "Make me to know your ways, O Lord.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.400]   Teach me your paths.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.880]   Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.160]   For you I wait.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   I'm waiting for you all day long.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.800]   Good and upright is the Lord, therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.500]   He leads the humble in what is right and teaches the humble his way."
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.800]   So the Lord loves you and would delight in your being in a healthy church with all your
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   gifts to use.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.660]   You have good reason to believe he'll answer this prayer of Psalm 25.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.840]   Number two, be clear on what a healthy church is.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.360]   Maybe take this season of searching and hit refresh on your own biblical grasp of what
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.920]   a healthy church is, just to make sure your picture is wholly biblical.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.880]   I'd recommend you use Mark Dever's book, "What is a Healthy Church?"
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.680]   Nine Marks, to clarify afresh what you're looking for.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.720]   Number three, talk to people you know in the city or who know the city.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.800]   Personal recommendations are probably the most reliable source of information, if the
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.280]   people are reliable.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.040]   This is more trustworthy, I think, than quick impressions from a one Sunday visit at the
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.120]   church.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.360]   Number four, we have huge advantages today, don't we, over previous generations because
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.280]   of the internet.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.880]   So explore the internet for churches and study their websites.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.280]   Now don't base it on how glitzy their website is.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.520]   The best churches may have a lousy website, but you want information, not impressions.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:23.000]   I typed into Google just yesterday, "Churches in the Twin Cities that Believe the Doctrines
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   of Grace."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.880]   I typed that right into Google.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.400]   Number two on the list was Cities Church, which is a church plant from Bethlehem where
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.640]   I minister, and number four was Bethlehem.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.960]   I would recommend both of those churches to anybody in the Twin Cities.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.040]   Of course, that kind of search is not enough.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.320]   Don't base your choice on a search like that.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.880]   You can get some real wacko results on Google.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720]   It's just a start, and it is liable.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.320]   That kind of search is liable to serious error.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.160]   Far better would be to, say, go to the Gospel Coalition website and look for connected churches.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.000]   That would be a good starting place, maybe, than just out of the blue typing something
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.600]   into Google, but that can be helpful.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.520]   Number five, look for a church with a certain kind of leadership, and a good place to start
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.000]   is 1 Peter 5, 2 through 4, "Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.520]   oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you."
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.800]   So look for joyful shepherds who love to serve others, not for shameful gain, but eagerly.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   Look for shepherds who don't love money, whose lives are simple, and who manifestly
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.680]   are eager to do the work, and they do it without pay if they could.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.560]   Not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.800]   So look for shepherds who are humble.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.360]   They don't feed on power.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.600]   They follow Jesus' words that, if you want to be really great, you've got to be the
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.760]   servant of everybody, and they motivate by example and are not coercive and demanding.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.240]   So number five is a certain kind of leadership.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.520]   Number six, look for a church with a certain kind of people.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:27.680]   1 John 3:14 says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   the brothers.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.240]   Whoever does not love abides in death."
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.880]   So a membership should be born again.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.600]   How do you recognize people who are born again?
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.720]   John says they love other believers.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:51.360]   So do you smell any kind of exclusiveness that pushes away believers of different races,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.480]   believers of different economic levels, believers of different education?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:05.640]   Do you smell a kind of exclusionary attitude that's foreign to born-again love?
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.080]   So after describing the kind of leaders a church should have, 1 Peter 5, Paul goes on
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.800]   to describe the people.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.080]   "Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.560]   Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, casting all your anxieties on him because
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   he cares for you."
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:33.520]   So look for a church who are loving, and look for a church who are humble and who roll their
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.760]   anxieties onto God.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   Number seven, then turn your attention to the teaching.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.240]   Look for a church that is not ashamed of any teaching in the Bible.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.760]   Don't go to a church that is fearful of displeasing people who are more shaped by the culture
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.960]   than the Scripture.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:01.080]   One of the ways to test this is usually the matters of manhood and womanhood, matters
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:07.440]   of sexuality, because that's such a hot, controverted issue in our day.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.800]   What do they teach?
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.920]   How do they teach on matters of the roles of men and women and sexuality?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   Do they teach the whole counsel of God, all of Scripture, as God's infallible Word, unashamedly?
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.220]   Number eight, then ask, "Could you serve in this church?"
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.060]   Do they think in terms of people being ministers and the pastors equipping the saints for
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.160]   the work of the ministry?
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.940]   You don't want to be a mere pew sitter.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:44.720]   And finally, number nine, I would ask, "Is the tone or the spirit of the life of this
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.660]   church one of serious joy?"
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:58.480]   Are they people who have learned to suffer by the grace of God and not become embittered
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.160]   or oblivious, naive?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.880]   Do they know how to be sorrowful yet always rejoicing?
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.480]   Are they real with their problems and with their suffering?
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.600]   Those are the steps I would take.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.480]   They certainly don't have to happen in that order, and I would end where I began.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.800]   Some just begin with prayer, saturate every step with prayer, and God will guide you.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.480]   He leads the humble in what is right and teaches the humble His way.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.360]   That is a great process laid out here.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.780]   And Pastor John here mentions TGC's church directory.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.940]   You can find it through a web search for the Gospel Coalition Church Directory.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.480]   Also check out the Nine Marks Church Search.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.700]   It has proven helpful to me over the years.
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.840]   Search for it by name, Nine, the number nine, Nine Marks Church Search.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.460]   Two super helpful tools for you to do some initial church reconnaissance, particularly
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.560]   if you're looking for a church inside the United States.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   And thank you for joining us.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.520]   If you have not subscribed to Ask Pastor John, what are you waiting for?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.480]   Consider doing so right now in your favorite podcast app, in YouTube or in Spotify, for
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.300]   our entire archive of episodes, or to submit a church question of your own.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.040]   Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.200]   Well God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.420]   Amen.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.960]   But wouldn't God also be glorified in us if we were just His minions, just slavish laborers
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   for Him?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.880]   It's a very important question at the heart of Christian hedonism, and it's up next.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.360]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.240]   Have a great weekend.
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.540]   [End of Audio]
