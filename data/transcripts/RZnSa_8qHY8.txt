[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   [Music]
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.720]   Hello Carl, this is Isabel from Spain and I have a question about teenagers and phone use.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.360]   I have recently got a job as a secondary school teacher and I am responsible for a group of 15
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.000]   years old. They have told me that they use their phones a lot and a lot means eight hours, the days
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   they don't have to go to school or four hours, the days they have to go to school and they are
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.720]   basically on TikTok, WhatsApp and Instagram, right? They also think that they are not good at studying
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:47.760]   and obviously I have connected the dots, right? And my question is how do I make them connect the dots
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.120]   from the perspective, from the point of view of a teacher which I think I'm someone they don't
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.880]   really trust like a parent and I would like to make them at least question what they do with
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   their time. So if you have any advice I will be very grateful because it's my first job as a
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.560]   teacher. Thank you very much. Bye. Well, you know, it is a universal problem. I think teenagers and
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.400]   their usage of these phones is extreme. You know, they do use them all the time. Now there's an
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.080]   interesting question here before we get to a solution is, okay, what's new about this and
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.040]   what's not? I mean, I think it's certainly true that if we went back to the 1980s or the 1990s,
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.400]   you know, what you would probably see is that teenagers used to watch a lot of TV.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.000]   So they probably were watching as much TV as they could instead of using their phone. So
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   it's not like they were before social media, we should be clear about that, like before social
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.800]   media, they would come home from school and be like, all right, mommy dear, I shall be in the
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.280]   library. I shall be in the library studying. Perhaps I will get a spot of tea in the conservatory as I
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.800]   take notes in my notebook. But if you need me, I will be thinking deeply. And then when social
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.240]   media came along, they were gone. Okay. It wasn't like that. But we have to first ask this question,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   TV versus what's happening with social media. Is it worse? Is it the same? Is it better?
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.040]   That's the place I want to start. I have my thoughts. Jesse, you and I grew up in a time
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.960]   when it would have been TV at this age. What do you think? More stupefying, but better worse than
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.000]   four hours of TikTok? Definitely worse. There we go. Yeah. Why does that mean? TV, you would sit
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.240]   down and be dedicated, then you could go outside or something. Now they're always bringing the
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:54.480]   phone with them. That's true. And TV was bad. It's not that entertaining. Compare ALF, which was on
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.520]   when we were kids, to algorithmically optimized TikTok videos that have been selected based off of
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   a 1,200-point data vector that has been analyzed with recurrent neural networks to figure out
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   exactly what to show you that is going to make you want to watch that through to the end. Compare
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.720]   that watching ALF to, "There is a complicated, distressing social dynamic happening at my school
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.240]   unfolding in these comments on Instagram posts, and people are talking about me, and my standing
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   is shifting. I'm going to look the hell out of that. I'm going to be on that phone and seeing
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.480]   what's going on." All of that is much more compelling than ALF. And as you're saying,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.000]   it can come with you everywhere. It comes with you in the car, it's on the bus,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.960]   wherever you go, you can be looking at it. So I think I agree. We have ramped up the invasiveness
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   and the addictiveness of the tools. What can this teacher do? A couple optimistic things to say.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   When I was on the road selling my book, Digital Minimalism, I was surprised by the positive
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   response from teenagers. So the thing about teenagers is there is an emerging counterculture
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.000]   where the countercultural behavior is to not use these tools. And we actually should not be
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   surprised by the rise of this counterculture because we've seen this be successful before.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.400]   Jesse, do you remember from when we were younger, the anti-smoking commercials that were sponsored
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   by was called "The Truth"? Somewhat, vaguely, yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   Basically what happened is, if I remember this correctly, is in the '90s, the Ad Council,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.080]   which is a federally funded organization that puts out television advertising for
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.120]   positive purposes, they hired a super fancy ad agency and said, "Okay, we want to figure out
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.440]   how to do ads to get basically young Jesse and young Cal to not smoke." And so they brought in
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.000]   real good ad people. And basically what they figured out was, focus in on the degree to which
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.960]   the tobacco companies are exploiting young people and manipulating them. And they're these old guys
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   in suits that are trying to trick you into smoking. And that was really effective. They did
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   a lot of faux hidden camera work with blurred faces, but it was really effective because
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.160]   teenagers hate this idea of being co-opted or exploited or manipulated by some 60-year-old guy
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.040]   in a suit. That was very powerful. And smoking rates, teen smoking rates, are much lower here
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.200]   in the countries. And that was partly to do with it. A similar dynamic, I believe, is fueling
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.040]   the anti-social media emergent counterculture among teenagers today is that, as they get more aware,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.280]   now it's not old guys in suits, it's 37-year-olds in t-shirts, but they're exploiting them.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.880]   They're like, "Do I really want to be Mark Zuckerberg's puppet, helping him be richer?"
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.400]   You know, they don't like these tech guys right now. They don't like these tech titans. And as
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:08.080]   they understand more, that this whole ecosystem is just designed to turn you into the cow in the
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.160]   milking machine in the barn. We're just sucking data out of your brain and selling it. And you're
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   the thing we're selling. You're a tool for a hot $500 billion company that's trying to make a very
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.960]   small number of people who live in Northern California richer. Teenagers don't like that.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.760]   And I began to pick up that thread when I was selling digital minimalism. I was on the road
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   in 2019, and I would meet teenagers who were finding great comfort in being a part of this
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.320]   counterculture and great respect from their peer group where they say, "Yeah, I don't use this
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.920]   stuff." So this is what we have right now is a tension between this has been designed to be
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.960]   incredibly appealing and addictive toward exactly your developing teenage brain. But on the other
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.760]   hand, your teenage brain hates the people who make these. You hate being their pawns, and you might
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   get some really good social street cred by being someone who doesn't use it. Both these things are
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.920]   happening at the same time. And so it's a matter of what is going to win. And I think the countercultural
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.880]   message is going to win. Teens love to be ahead of something, feel cool, feel authentic. And this
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:18.000]   is giving them exactly that capability. The actual logistical social interaction piece of social
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.960]   media, that's largely moving the chat tools and text threads. So it's not like you're going to be
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.920]   ostracized and not know what's going on if you're not on TikTok as a 15-year-old. It's not like if
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.600]   you're not on Snapchat as a 14-year-old, you're going to be cut out of social circles. Now,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.120]   these non-social media text-based coordination, collaboration, alternatives like WhatsApp and
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.080]   just text threads and iMessage, those are taking over the logistical roles anyway,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.000]   so it's much easier to step away. And that's what I think is going to happen.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.160]   All we need, and this is John Haidt's theory, all we need to get a tipping point is not that
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.960]   most young people don't use social media, but that most people know someone who doesn't use
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:06.880]   social media. You just need a validation of that possibility in your immediate social sphere.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.360]   In my class as a junior or whatever in the secondary school in Spain where Isabelle teaches,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.920]   there's two kids who don't use social media. And they're kind of cool, I kind of like that. That's
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.440]   all you need. Now, if you're really feeling like you hate this and you're overwhelmed, and a lot
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.600]   of kids do feel that way, you have permission to leave because you're not doing something new,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.840]   you're joining that group. And this is John Haidt's theory. You don't have to get an entire
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.000]   class to stop using social media before your kid will. You need two people in the class not to use
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.280]   social media before your kid thinks it's an option. So I'm optimistic about it. I've said
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.440]   this on the show a lot. I think these small number of monopoly, giant centralized social
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:52.000]   media companies dominating internet discourse is a moment that is coming to an end. We're going to
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.360]   look back at it as a 10-year period. The idea that 10 years from now, we're all going to be on
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.960]   two or three of these massive centralized social media platforms, I don't think it's going to be
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.240]   that way. Their moment has come, their moment is passing. And so, Isabelle, all of this should just
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:14.720]   be optimism that this will get better, maybe not in the next few months, but in the next few years,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:20.080]   perhaps, it will get better. In the meantime, those are the two things to talk about. A,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:27.920]   you're a product, you are being exploited. Update those truth anti-smoking ads to the
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.280]   world of teenage social media use. Hammer that point. You guys are plugged into the pods in the
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:44.240]   matrix, and Agent Smith is Mark Zuckerberg, right? Push that point. Two, talk about thinking is a
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   skill that you have to practice. And if you're constantly looking at screens when you're out of
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.040]   school, your mind muscle is going to be weak, and there's a lot of advantages to having a strong
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.960]   mind muscle. It's not just you're going to do better in your schoolwork, which you will, and
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.600]   it'll take less time to study and you'll be happier, but you're going to understand the
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.560]   world better. You're going to take in more sophisticated information. You're going to be
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.080]   more impactful. You're going to grow into someone who can actually make a difference in a world
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.760]   where intellectual skill is the main skill that matters, where brawn is no longer that relevant
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.280]   anymore. This is a muscle that is hurt. If you're looking at a screen all the time, you're eating
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.440]   junk food as an athlete. I think that is also a really effective message for young people.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.320]   Give them the positive. Don't be on the screen all the time exactly because you want to have
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.800]   a stronger brain. If you have a stronger brain, everything will be open to you. And if you don't,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.280]   you're plugged into the matrix to help Agent Smith's bank account, and you're going to be
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.400]   worse at thinking, and it's going to, your life, your world, everything's going to be more
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   constrained. Push those two points in the short term. I think that will help. More teenagers are
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.320]   more receptive to leaving social media than you think. And we are going to see more and more of
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.640]   that in the years ahead as this moment of social media monopoly hopefully comes to a pretty soon
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   end. I don't know. I don't know if you buy that, Jesse. Everyone thinks I'm too optimistic about
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.400]   this, but I'm just not convinced that this moment of monopoly social media is somehow like a
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:09.920]   persistent state. One thing that does happen is a lot of teenage kids use Instagram messaging to
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.960]   communicate as opposed to WhatsApp and text message and stuff like that. So I think that
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.000]   goes into part of the problem where they're using that platform to message, but they're also using
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.240]   it to look at a lot of stuff. Well, Zuckerberg is smart, which is I caution, because I cover this
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.040]   space, I caution journalists. And I made a little bit of fun of him too about the metaverse, right?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.440]   Because he put out this clunky video where he was trying to introduce people to the metaverse. He's
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   not good on camera. And I did make fun of him in a New Yorker piece. I talked about how in this video
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:52.320]   introducing his vision of the metaverse, he looked like a cyborg running out of date software.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.760]   Because he has this sort of like halting, weird delivery. But here's the thing, he's smart.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:06.960]   There are no other that I can think of, founders from that era that were so young that are still
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.040]   in charge of a company of that size. You know how impossible that is to stay in charge of a company
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.600]   that's approaching a trillion dollar market cap when you started that company when you're 20 years
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.520]   old? He's a savvy guy. And this is what we see with Instagram. And they bought WhatsApp. He knows
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.240]   this, right? He knows Facebook is on its way out. They bought Instagram. He knows that's going to be
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.400]   taken down by TikTok. They bought WhatsApp because he knows it's actually going to be the unendormed
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.600]   conversation that matters. Instagram messaging is all about keeping people engaging in the Instagram
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.360]   ecosystem. Oh, as long as I'm here, I might as well look at these photos over here. He knows
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:45.200]   what he's doing. He knows what he's doing with the metaverse. There is an inevitable shift towards a
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.240]   world in which much more of what we see every day is going to be virtual. It's incredibly inefficient
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.480]   to actually have to manufacture all of these plastic things that have chips inside of them.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.760]   And you have to build it at the Foxconn plant in China. And inevitably, the future is going to be,
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.760]   I have on a glass that can make any screen I want running any software I want anywhere I want in my
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.440]   physical space. Why would I have an iPad, a phone, a computer, and a big screen TV when I could just
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.760]   make any of those screens appear anywhere I wanted? And the only piece of silicon I have to own is the
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.240]   thing that runs these glass. Everything else is in the cloud. He knows that's coming. And he wants
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.600]   to be out ahead of it. The world is going to virtualize. So he's a smart guy, which is what
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.760]   I'm going to say. So he is an able foe. So his initial ploy-- I mean, this is like Commodore
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.960]   Vanderbilt, if you'll excuse some early American economic history. Think of Zuckerberg like
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.520]   Commodore Vanderbilt. Think about Facebook like Vanderbilt's fleet of ferries to get across from
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.560]   New Jersey to the Hudson to New York to Manhattan. This is where Vanderbilt began his fortune,
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   was ferry boats. And then he moved to longer range steamships to go up and down the ply,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.720]   the eastern seaboard. And then he got into railroads after that. He watched the technological
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.240]   landscape evolve in early industrial America and kept ahead of those trends. And he was ruthless
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.480]   and smart and built one of the world's largest fortunes out of it. That's how they'll think
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.320]   about Zuckerberg. You have to think about Facebook like those ferry boats. It made him his first
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.840]   couple of billion. But the railroads are coming, the steam shippers are coming, and they're going
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.080]   to be completely different technology. So I think he's going to be around. Keep an eye on him.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.920]   But his first thing-- let's put all of our information into the screens and look at the--
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.440]   click on the phones and do social media back and forth. That's going to go away. So he's going to
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   stay savvy guy. The technological landscape is going to evolve. So I know that's my techno
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:55.520]   prognostications. Don't sleep on Zuckerberg, but also don't overemphasize the importance of the
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.200]   existing social media platforms. I think that's a little bit-- it's a clunky technology. It's had
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:07.680]   its moment.
