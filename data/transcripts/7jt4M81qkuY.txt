[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   There was so much about it that was eye-opening for me.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.820]   I'm leaving with a sense of urgency.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.060]   It was really a trip I'll never forget.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.420]   My name is Michael Porter, Jr.,
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.220]   and I play professional basketball.
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.860]   I heard about iJM through really a conference.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.620]   It was a bunch of professional athletes.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.660]   It was a great experience,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.160]   and I heard about them and what they do
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.700]   and the work they do.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.200]   - Yeah, Michael, MPJ, I've known him for about a year.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.840]   I met him actually at a conference
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.900]   where I presented the work of iJM.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.480]   He immediately came up to me and said,
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.880]   "Hey, I love the work you're doing.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.980]   "How can I be involved?"
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.580]   And getting to spend time with him here,
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.880]   he's such a curious person.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.480]   He has such a big heart.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.920]   - Thank you for your glory.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.060]   Thank you for bringing each of us on Team Freedom
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.400]   from around the world to be here today.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.860]   - The work that I think that iJM does is very important
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.000]   and it's something that's close to my heart.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200]   It's something that I've always saw as a global issue
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380]   and wanted to play my part in doing what I could
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.800]   just to help out in any way I could.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.700]   It means a lot to share with my family.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.640]   I brought my sister down here with me.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.080]   You know, that's kind of my traveling buddy.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.020]   I brought her husband.
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.980]   Nicodemus Christopher, he's kind of like my right-hand man.
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.480]   You know, they're looking forward to being here as well.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.980]   - Yeah, I heard out here in the Philippines
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.060]   they love basketball, and I think, you know,
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.360]   being an athlete, it should mean so much more
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060]   than just putting a ball in a hoop
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.960]   or, you know, throwing a ball across a field
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.460]   or whatever sports you play.
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.600]   I think really using the platform God gave you
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.940]   for impact to, you know, inspire other people
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.980]   to make other people happy is really the bigger purpose.
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.140]   To be out here in a country that they love basketball
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.940]   is a blessing, and, you know, I've already had
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.980]   a lot of people come up to me and want pictures
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.880]   and things like that, so to get to put a smile
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.540]   on people's face is amazing.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.740]   (gentle music)
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.940]   - I was 16 years old when I was tricked
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.300]   into this computer job.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.740]   I became orphaned.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.340]   My mother and father died when I was 13.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.580]   I was experiencing physical and verbal abuse
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.580]   from my siblings, so I had this desire
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.560]   to move out and be independent.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.700]   So I stumbled this friend request in Facebook
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.200]   from a stranger.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.760]   The girl who recruited me was in Pampanga.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.900]   She told me that I could take classes
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.000]   at night after my work, that she will give me free food,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.140]   that she will give me free lodging.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.980]   When I got there to the house, I saw that instead
[00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.320]   of a computer shop that I was expecting,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.620]   we arrived in a house with a red gate.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.460]   When I entered the house, I saw girls came out
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.500]   from one of the rooms inside that house.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.020]   They were naked, and I was like so shocked.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.360]   I didn't even know how to react on that,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360]   and that's when she explained to me what the real job was.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.340]   Realizing what the real situation is,
[00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.840]   I told her that I don't wanna do this anymore.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.880]   I wanna go back home, but she told me
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.020]   that I had to pay for the 150 USD that she sent me
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.780]   before I could go back home.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.420]   I didn't have any money with me back then,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.660]   so I literally fell into her trap,
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.360]   and that's how I got exploited there every day,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.000]   sometimes at eight hours a day, sometimes at 12 hours.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.040]   So when I refused to do what they order me to do,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.200]   they would punish me, they will starve me,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.540]   they would let me sleep on the floor without anything.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.820]   I would describe it as a very long tunnel
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.620]   that I cannot see the end,
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.120]   you know, where there would be sunlight or anything.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.820]   And I was just desperate the whole time,
[00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.260]   desperate, hopeless.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.860]   - You know, those stories are always so heartbreaking
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.460]   and touching just 'cause they're so personal,
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.200]   and you get to see the person that went through it,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.000]   but I think it's also so encouraging,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.500]   and to see them use their story to inspire,
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.380]   but also to open up and just use their voice,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.540]   I think is encouraging.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.840]   - No one is safe nowadays, no one is safe.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.420]   Your daughter could be next, your sister could be next,
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.820]   your niece or nephews could be next.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.060]   - Your visit to the Philippines matters greatly,
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.160]   as it brings to light the enormity
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   of the online threats against our children,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.560]   but it also possibly could highlight
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.660]   the efforts of the Philippine government
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.040]   in prioritizing the fight against OSIAC and CSAM.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.200]   - It was awesome to be able to get
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.500]   so many different government agencies
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.440]   in a room with us at IJM.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.380]   It just, it goes to show the power
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.380]   of what these athletes can do, right?
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.580]   You travel all the way across the world,
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.220]   and people know who you are.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.260]   - Athletes in America sometimes are so involved
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.720]   in their sport that they don't realize
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.000]   the platform and the impact they could have.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.300]   - It seemed like they understand that this is a priority,
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.360]   and it seemed like they were willing
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.000]   to play their part as well.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.280]   - Right now we're at a park in Papanga,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.540]   playing with the kids from a shelter.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.340]   - It's gonna be, I think, a life-changing experience.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.980]   It's gonna put things in perspective for me,
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.440]   but more importantly, I think getting to spend time
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.560]   with some of those kids, I think will be amazing.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.420]   - Just imagine the kind of exploitation
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.980]   that they have experienced in the past,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.460]   and now they can be children again,
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.760]   and they can just walk, and run,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.100]   and just do something else that they could not,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.900]   they're unable to do in their previous life.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.100]   - It's just good to see, you know,
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.600]   all the hard things they've been through.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.380]   Still here being kids, still here,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.240]   just wanting to enjoy life, and smile, and have fun.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   It's really good to see.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.940]   - Walking into that shelter,
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.420]   I kinda immediately saw the little girl.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.260]   She was so helpless.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.060]   Everyone else in the shelter was a little bit older,
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.660]   kinda knew what was going on a little bit.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.360]   You know, she was a little bit, I think,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.260]   just frightened about the whole situation at first,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.560]   all of us being there, but later on in the day,
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.640]   she kinda opened up, and we got to roll the ball
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.840]   back and forth, and that was a touching moment for me.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.780]   - Yeah, this has been, this I can pretty confidently say,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.940]   this has been the best trip of my life.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.040]   I am so grateful for the opportunity to be here,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.720]   and see the work that IJM is doing.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.780]   It's really tugged at my soul, so I'm grateful, yeah.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.760]   - Watching him with the kids, you know,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.320]   like, they could barely reach up and give him a high five
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.560]   'cause he's so much taller than them,
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.960]   but he has this heart for children,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.700]   and it's very apparent by the way he was with the kids.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.260]   So, it's been awesome.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.600]   - There was moments throughout the whole week,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.880]   things that I won't forget,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.780]   and things that I'll be able to take going forward,
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.440]   and hopefully help this issue moving forward.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.380]   - Just by listening, you provide value.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.220]   We need you.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.320]   You encourage us and give us hope.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.180]   - A large part of my life has been trying to make it myself,
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.220]   and get to the place where I'm at today,
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.920]   but I think being out here, for me,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.100]   is all about how I can serve others,
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.360]   and see how God can impact my heart
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.840]   through serving others.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.440]   (gentle music)
