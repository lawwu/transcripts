[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   do welcome you tonight to our 21st meeting of Intermediate Biblical Counseling. It's a joy to
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.400]   have this time together and to study God's Word, and it's a joy to meet together in this online
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.080]   format. I know that there are many who are joining us from all over California and even outside of
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.760]   California. I want to just welcome you, and thanks for continuing in your studies. I trust that these
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.360]   sessions have been a blessing to you, and trust that the Lord is continuing to bless your time in
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.920]   His Word. I just wanted to give a personal thanks to all of you for your encouragement and for your
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.320]   prayers this last week. It was a joy to pass my doctoral oral defense, and it was a little bit
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.840]   nerve-wracking there. I didn't sleep much the night before, but God was faithful, and I do
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.520]   want to thank you for your prayers. That was very kind of many of you to pray for me, and I do
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.640]   believe that many have prayed me across the finish line here, and so just thank you for
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.800]   all of your words of encouragement and your words of support. All of that has been a tremendous
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   blessing to me. As you may have known, my faculty advisor in my doctoral studies was Dr. Stuart
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.920]   Scott, who is also the biblical counseling professor at the Master's University and the
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.200]   Master's Seminary, and he's adjunct at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and Dr. Scott said
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.080]   a statement during the defense that I've heard him say often in many different settings, and
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.640]   he often says this, that we're just passing on to others what has been passed on to us,
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   and he reminded of that truth to me as we completed that defense,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.520]   just that we're passing on to others what's been passed on to us, that many invested in Dr. Scott,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.160]   and he has been faithful to pass that on to others, and we're now called to pass that on to
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.120]   those whom we minister to, and I was just reminded that that really is the heartbeat and the focus of
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   why we exist as an ACBC training center, why we have this class, Intermediate Biblical Counseling.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.480]   We are seeking to pass on to others what has been passed on to us, and many have invested in
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   my life and in my wife's life, and this class exists to pass what we have received on to you,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   and we hope and we pray that you will take what you have learned, and you will pass that on to
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.920]   others, and that we will see the ministry of the Word of God multiply in this way, and so
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.240]   we do trust that that will be the fruit of our study and our time together. So thank you again
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.000]   for joining us tonight. Tonight we are looking at theology exam number 21, and we are looking at the
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.240]   role of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life, the role of the Holy Spirit in your life and in my
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.760]   life, and I was just thinking what a joy to be able to study this topic and to devote an hour
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.080]   to this great subject of the role of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit's ministry
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.640]   in each of our lives, the Holy Spirit's ministry in the church, and our dependence upon the Holy
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   Spirit in our counseling ministry. What a joy it is to be able to devote an hour to this subject.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   I do pray that the hour we spend tonight will lead us to a fresh dependence this week,
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.240]   a fresh reliance upon, and a fresh passion for the ministry of the Holy Spirit in each
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   of our lives, and I do pray that our study tonight will lead us to a fresh expectation
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.280]   and anticipation of the Holy Spirit's work as we are faithful to His Word,
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.120]   and as we simply submit ourselves to the Holy Spirit's leadership and desire to be
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.240]   used as members of Christ's body to bless and to encourage other believers,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   and so I'm looking forward to our time tonight. Let me pray for us, and let's devote our time to
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.280]   the Lord in prayer. Father, thank you for this class. Thank you for each of my brothers and
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:58.400]   sisters in Christ who are joining us on this webinar in this online format that we may study
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.880]   your Word, that we may express once again our need for the Holy Spirit to lead us and guide us,
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:15.600]   our need for the Holy Spirit to use your Word to change our hearts and our lives for your glory.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.360]   We do rejoice in this topic. We thank you that you have given to us not only your Son,
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.880]   the Lord Jesus Christ, to be our Savior and to be our perfect substitute, but you have given to us
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:40.240]   your Holy Spirit to be our helper, to be the one who comes alongside of us in our daily lives,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.920]   and indeed, not only alongside of us, but you have given to us your Spirit to live in us.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   We thank you that all of fruitful ministry is accomplished by the power and through the
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.840]   ministry of the Holy Spirit, and so we pray that you would teach us of how we need to rely
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.440]   upon the Holy Spirit in each of our lives, how we are to rely upon Him for our counseling ministry,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   and help us to study your Scriptures well that we may come to an accurate understanding of these
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   truths and that we may live them out in our daily lives. And so we place ourselves once again
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.720]   in dependence upon your Spirit to take your Word and to work in our lives, and we pray all this
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.960]   in Christ's precious name, amen. Amen. Well, we are looking at, as I mentioned, theology exam
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:49.280]   number 21, the role of the Holy Spirit, and I'll go ahead and read the question for us.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.200]   The question is this, "Explain the role of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life, describing
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.760]   the importance of this role in the counseling process." And so just generally, the question
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.840]   is asking you to explain the role of the Holy Spirit in all the Christian life, which shouldn't
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.440]   be difficult because really all of the Christian life is to be lived in dependence on the ministry
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.040]   of the Holy Spirit, and we'll talk about some of those features tonight, and then specifically to
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.040]   apply the doctrine of the Holy Spirit to the counseling process. How are we as biblical
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:40.400]   counselors to be dependent on the ministry of the Spirit in counseling? And just a brief note here
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:47.440]   that every time I counsel, I try to remind myself of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.560]   I try to remind myself to trust in the Holy Spirit, and that gives me hope in the counseling
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:02.480]   process. It is not my job to change people's lives. It's not my job to fix all of their problems.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:10.160]   It's not my job to be able to address every issue. It is my job to place myself in
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:18.800]   dependence on the Holy Spirit, to make myself available for what He wants to do through me
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.280]   in the lives of others, and to trust that the Holy Spirit will use His Word to change lives
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.560]   for the glory of Christ. And so as you look at the second part of that essay question,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:40.560]   that really is a question that should be easy to answer. How important is the Holy Spirit
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:49.840]   in the counseling process? And I would just say that it is vitally important for counselors to be
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:57.440]   filled with the Spirit, to be led by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, and to be dependent on
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.360]   the Holy Spirit in the counseling ministry. So if you look at your handout on page one,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.280]   I've noted a number of helpful resources that will be helpful in your study. I do encourage
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:17.040]   you to read Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology, Paul Enns' The Moody Handbook of Theology,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:24.480]   and then Heath Lambert's A Theology of Biblical Counseling. I encourage you to read those portions
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.560]   in those good works, and that will be helpful to you, and just to refresh your understanding of
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:38.320]   the person of the Holy Spirit and how He works in believers' lives. And then a couple of additional
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:46.880]   resources, you have chapter six of How to Counsel Biblically, edited by John MacArthur. That's a
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.360]   work that we assigned in the year one biblical counseling curriculum, and specifically chapter
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.080]   six, The Work of the Spirit and Biblical Counseling, is a very helpful read if you
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.600]   want to refresh your understanding of how vitally important the Holy Spirit is in counseling
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:16.000]   ministry. And then I sent to you as a PDF chapter three of Christ-Centered Biblical Counseling,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.520]   written by Justin Holcomb and Mike Wilkerson, The Ministry of the Holy Spirit. That too is a very
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   helpful chapter in relating the doctrine of the Holy Spirit specifically to counseling ministry.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.520]   So I do encourage you that PDF is available as a sample online. That one chapter is free. You will
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.560]   want to get the entire book. The entire book is incredibly helpful, but that one chapter is
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.640]   available as a PDF sample, so I wanted to put that in your hands. I'd encourage you to get
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:01.920]   Jay Adams, The Christian Counselor's Manual. As you know, Adams was in many ways the founder of
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.800]   the biblical counseling movement as we know it. He's considered to be the one who led the movement
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.120]   in the first generation in opposition to the church's reliance upon secular psychology,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:22.160]   and he has a chapter in The Christian Counselor's Manual called The Holy Spirit is the Principal
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:30.320]   Person. This actually is a doctrine that Adams was very passionate about and emphasized greatly
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.880]   in his defense of biblical counseling, in his defense of the idea that the church
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:44.240]   is able to counsel. Adams emphasized the fact that we as the body of Christ,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.760]   we who are in the church, are the only ones in this entire world who have
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:57.280]   the ministry of the Holy Spirit. We have the person of the Holy Spirit living in us. Our bodies
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:03.680]   are temples of the Holy Spirit. The church is filled with the power and the influence of the
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   Holy Spirit, and so Adams' question was this. If we really want people's lives to change,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:18.320]   what on earth are we doing as the church sending our people to secular psychologists who do not
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.440]   have the Holy Spirit? How would we expect our people, members of the body of Christ,
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:32.320]   to become more like Christ if we send them to unbelievers who do not have the Holy Spirit?
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:40.160]   And so Adams greatly emphasized the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in the first generation of
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.560]   the biblical counseling movement, and so you will want to read firsthand a lot of what he wrote
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.920]   about the Holy Spirit, and chapter two of the Christian Counselor's Manual is a good read
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:02.000]   for that purpose. I'd also want to just note that Greg Heisler's book, Spirit-Led Preaching,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.920]   the Holy Spirit's Role in Sermon Preparation and Delivery, that is a book that changed my life,
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.320]   and I would just note that for your reference. It's relating the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.520]   specifically to sermon preparation and not so much to counseling, but you will find that the
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:29.680]   principles in that book apply to every ministry of the church, not just preaching. Before I read
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.560]   Heisler's work, I really was a preacher and a teacher who was dependent upon the mechanics of
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.440]   teaching. I wanted to get my outlines right. I wanted to get my content right. I wanted to get
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:48.480]   my illustrations right and my applications right. I was really dependent upon a lot of the routine
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:56.080]   of sermon preparation, and none of that has changed. I'm still as devoted to trying to get
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:03.920]   those elements of preaching and teaching right, but what Heisler helped me to see is that apart
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:11.440]   from a reliance upon the Holy Spirit throughout the process of sermon preparation and delivery,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:20.960]   the preacher's ministry comes without power. You can get the mechanics right, but if the Holy
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:28.720]   Spirit does not bless and use what you have done, then your sermons will not come with power,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.600]   because it is the Holy Spirit's ministry that changes people's lives. Now, please don't get
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:41.120]   me wrong. A dependence upon the Holy Spirit, I believe, leads to more diligence and more study,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.920]   not less. We are not advocating this idea that you just become dependent upon the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   and then you don't study or you don't strive for excellence. That's not what Heisler is teaching.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:02.800]   That's not what I believe as well, but there is this idea that we must pursue excellence and study
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:10.960]   and be diligently devoted to the text as we are reliant upon the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.080]   and Heisler's work helped me to see that. That's a book that changed my life, and so I just want
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.840]   to commend that reading to you, and you'll find many of those principles apply to counseling
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:30.240]   ministry as well. Now, let me move to the next page and get into your notes, and just I'll begin
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.200]   with this statement, which should be an obvious statement to all, and that is this. "Effective
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.680]   biblical counseling is impossible without the Holy Spirit." Now, you will know that that statement is
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.760]   not that effective biblical counseling is difficult without the Holy Spirit. I want to emphasize
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:58.160]   the idea that it is impossible. We could say this of every ministry of the church,
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:04.640]   that every ministry of the church, it is impossible to achieve its true objectives apart
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:13.200]   from the ministry of the Holy Spirit. In fact, we could say this about every aspect of the Christian
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.920]   life. We could do a study which would demonstrate throughout the New Testament that we worship as we
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:30.960]   are dependent upon the Holy Spirit. We serve as we are gifted by the Holy Spirit. We pray and we sing
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:38.720]   as we are filled with the Holy Spirit. We relate to one another in love and in graciousness and
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:46.880]   kindness and in mercy because we are filled with the sweet fruit of the Holy Spirit. We develop
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.320]   discipline and self-control and learn how to set priorities in life and manage our schedules as
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:17:02.400]   we are empowered by the Holy Spirit to bear the fruit of self-control, and as we are mastered
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.840]   by the influence of the Holy Spirit. Indeed, the Scriptures would demonstrate to us that
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:17.760]   we grow in holiness only as we are filled with the Spirit, led by the Spirit, walked by the Spirit,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:26.480]   and bear the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and as we are taught by the Holy Spirit. I would ask you
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:35.920]   this question. Is there any aspect of the Christian life that can be lived apart from the Holy Spirit?
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.200]   I mean, you could name any aspect of the Christian life, and you will find that the Scriptures tie
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:50.400]   that aspect of life to the ministry of the Holy Spirit. So, when I say that effective biblical
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.480]   counseling is impossible without the Holy Spirit, I hope I'm not making a controversial statement.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:09.680]   All of the Christian life is impossible apart from the Holy Spirit working in us and through us.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:18.960]   We are completely dependent upon the Holy Spirit for every aspect of the Christian life.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:27.120]   That realization, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, ought to fill us with a fresh sense of
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:35.440]   humility and dependence. We ought to acknowledge our need for the Holy Spirit to work
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:45.360]   in our life and pray to the Father that the Spirit would work in our lives to glorify Christ
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:53.040]   and to lead us to become more like God's Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. I just want to add this.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.360]   The realization that all of the Christian life is lived by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:11.040]   ought to fill us with a fresh sense of excitement and anticipation, and dare I say, even expectation
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:18.880]   of what the Holy Spirit will do in our lives for the glory of God. We ought to wake up every morning
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.000]   and ask the question, "What is the Holy Spirit going to do in my life today to make me more
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.880]   like Christ? How is the Holy Spirit going to use me as one of the members of the body of Christ to
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   bless someone else in the church and even in the community as we proclaim the gospel to
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   a dying world? How is the Holy Spirit going to work today?" Because the Holy Spirit is
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:55.440]   active in this day and in this season of life. He is working all across our nation to glorify
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.880]   the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and He's using us as His vessels, as His instruments
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:12.800]   to simply achieve that end of glorifying the Son, Jesus Christ. You and I can't manufacture this
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:21.200]   work. We can't make people change. We can't make people bear fruit. We can't change people's hearts.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.040]   We can't do this work in people's lives where they start to live for something different other
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:37.120]   than themselves. All we can do and all we're called to do is to be faithful servants, vessels
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:45.760]   who are submitted to the ministry of the Spirit and then approach ministry with a fresh sense of
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:54.720]   anticipation and excitement and expectation that the Holy Spirit is going to use His word
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:02.320]   in people's lives to change their hearts for God's glory. This ought to fill us with
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:09.120]   fresh encouragements for ministry. Do you know how much pressure it takes off me to realize that
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.640]   ministry doesn't depend on me? It's not dependent upon my eloquence or my ability to say things
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:24.400]   perfectly. It's not dependent upon my charisma or my ability to do certain things in an excellent
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.040]   way. Yes, I want to glorify God and do the best I can with my abilities, but ultimately how freeing
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:39.920]   it is to know that it's not up to me. It is by the power and the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:45.680]   that's people's lives and hearts change. I tell you that gives you a sense of freedom when you
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:51.520]   enter into a counseling session. It just kind of takes the pressure off where you realize that
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.080]   that's not my job to change this person's life. It's my job to be faithful and to allow the Spirit
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:05.840]   to use me for His glory. Zechariah 4, verse 6, "Then he said to me, 'This is the word of the Lord
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:14.480]   to Zerubbabel, not by might nor by power, but by my spirit,' says the Lord of hosts." Ezekiel 36,
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.760]   verse 27, the great language of the new covenant, "And I will put my spirit within you and cause
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules." 1 Corinthians 6, verse 19 says,
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:36.320]   "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:46.080]   You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God with your body." It's not
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:53.600]   just that the Holy Spirit has come upon us. It is indeed the reality that the Holy Spirit lives
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:02.240]   in us. Our bodies are literally temples of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit lives in us,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:11.040]   and He empowers us to faithful ministry. It was said of C. H. Spurgeon that the true explanation
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.960]   of Spurgeon's ministry, then, is to be found in the person and power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.520]   He himself was deeply conscious of this. It was not men's admiration he wanted, but he was jealous
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.440]   that they should stand in awe of God. "God has come unto us not to exalt us, but to exalt
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:37.520]   himself," so writes Iain Murray. Spurgeon, it is said, would ascend to the pulpit, repeating
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.160]   over and over to himself, "Trust in the Holy Spirit. Trust in the Holy Spirit." And applying
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:51.440]   that concept to counseling ministry, Justin Holcomb and Mike Wilkerson said this, "Rather
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.000]   than asking about the role of the Holy Spirit in counseling, we should be asking about the
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.360]   counselor's role in the Holy Spirit's counseling." Biblical counseling is not merely a dialogue
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.760]   between the counselor and the counselee. Rather, it is a trilogue in which the counselor
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:19.280]   participates in the Spirit's work already underway with the counselee. The Spirit is
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.120]   actively engaged in counseling, working directly on the counselor and the counselee,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:32.960]   and through each to help the other. Well, that'll give you some fresh encouragement to do
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.320]   counseling ministry. And this is the diagram. I'll place this on the screen.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:44.000]   This is the diagram that's found in their book when they talk about biblical counseling as
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.680]   a trilogue. You have the Holy Spirit who is working in the life of the counselor. You have
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:58.160]   the Holy Spirit who is working in the life of the counselee. And then you have the Holy Spirit
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.760]   working through the conversation as the counselor and the counselee interact with each other. That's
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:15.040]   a very helpful conceptual diagram that gives us great encouragement to counsel. As you submit to
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:24.080]   the Holy Spirit's ministry in your life, you can experience this dynamic. And I have had my share
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.000]   of counseling sessions that have gone awry. And I've also had my share of counseling sessions
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.680]   where someone will come to me later down, perhaps months later after the counseling session and say,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:45.200]   "Those meetings changed my life." And I have to just confess, that wasn't me. I can't do that.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:53.040]   I can't make a person's life change. But the fact that it was the Holy Spirit's delight to
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:01.600]   use a member, a servant of the body of Christ as a means to minister His word. And in the end,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:09.200]   you just marvel at the power of the Holy Spirit, that the Spirit works through this counselor-counselee
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:16.080]   relationship to change both the counselee and the counselor. It is this dynamic relationship,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:23.440]   and that ought to give you fresh encouragement to counsel. Back to your handout, Heath Lambert
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:29.600]   writes this, "The Holy Spirit is vital to a biblical approach to counseling. In fact,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.960]   if biblical counselors were to offer any qualifications to their theology of the
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.920]   sufficiency of Scripture, it would have to do with the doctrine of the Spirit." In other words,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   Lambert is saying, what we don't mean by the doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:54.240]   is that we don't need the Holy Spirit. If your understanding of the doctrine of
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:01.280]   Scripture sufficiency leads you to a place where you are not reliant upon the Holy Spirit,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:09.280]   then you have not understood the doctrine of sufficiency. Lambert continues that biblical
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.960]   counselors do not believe that the Scriptures are sufficient without the ministry of the Holy
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.120]   Spirit. The Bible does not work automatically and on its own as a sacred words wash over people.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:28.400]   The word of God is only effective when the Spirit of God renders it effective in the lives of
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:36.000]   individuals. What he's saying there is it is not only that we minister the word and we minister
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   the Scriptures. It is that we minister the Scriptures as we are empowered by the Holy
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.400]   Spirit and people learn the Scriptures as the Spirit teaches them what is in the word of God.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:28:02.480]   The Spirit of God uses the word of God in the life of the child of God to change his life
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:09.520]   and her life to the glory of God. As I mentioned, J. Adams made a huge point of this in the first
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:16.000]   generation of the biblical counseling movement. He emphasized this point that counseling is the
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   work of the Holy Spirit. Effective counseling cannot be done apart from him. He is called
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.120]   the paraclete, the counselor who in Christ's place came to be another counselor of the same sort that
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:38.880]   Christ had been to his disciples. Because unsaved counselors do not know the Holy Spirit, they ignore
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:46.560]   his counseling activity and fail to make avail themselves of his direction and power.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:54.000]   All of the personality traits that might be held forth to counselees as fundamental goals for
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:03.520]   growth. Here it is. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:13.680]   self-control. God declares to be the fruit that is the result of the work of the Spirit.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:20.240]   Now look at that list. I said this in the year one basic training course and I'll repeat it again.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:29.200]   For emphasis, I don't know of a single counseling issue that is being dealt with in the world today
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:38.800]   that would not be greatly helped if not completely transformed if the counselee simply bore the fruit
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.560]   of the Spirit. There isn't a single marital issue that I can think of that would not be
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:52.720]   transformed if husband and wife simply started to bear the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:59.600]   kindness, goodness, faithfulness, self-control. I can't think of a single personal issue from
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:08.160]   anger to anxiety to depression to conflict to an eating disorder or a cutting issue. I can't
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.960]   think of a single counseling issue that is not addressed by the fruit of the Spirit and that
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:25.040]   would not be transformed if the counselee simply bore the fruit of the Spirit. This is the power of
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:34.960]   the Spirit's ministry. So Adam says not only is it futile to attempt to generate these qualities
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:42.000]   apart from him, the Holy Spirit, as non-Christians and even some Christian counselors try to do,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.240]   but such an approach, and here's the bluntness of Adams. You have to love his approach. He was
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:58.560]   very blunt when he got to some of these issues. Such an approach is at bottom rebellion against
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:06.720]   God-grounded humanistic assumptions of man's autonomy. Bypassing the Spirit amounts to the
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:14.000]   denial of human depravity and the affirmation of man's innate goodness. The need for grace
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.480]   and the atoning work of Christ are both undercut and the counselee is left instead with the husk
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:29.440]   of a legalistic works righteousness which will lead ultimately to despair since it divests itself
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   of the life and power of the Spirit. That's Paul's statement, right? In Galatians 3 verse 3,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:44.320]   Paul said to the Galatians, "Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit,
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:55.840]   are you now being perfected by the flesh?" So here's the encouraging thing at the bottom of your
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:05.360]   page on page 2. God has not been stingy with the Holy Spirit in our lives. God has not just given
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:12.160]   us a little bit of the Holy Spirit or a taste of the Holy Spirit. God has given to us the ministry
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:21.280]   of the Holy Spirit in fullest measure and the Spirit is not against us. The Spirit is for us.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:31.760]   1 Corinthians 2 verse 12, "Now we have received not the Spirit of the world but the capital S,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:41.280]   Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God." How good is
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:49.120]   God? How gracious is He? How generous is He to give us the ministry of the Spirit in fullest
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:57.360]   measure, to pour out His Spirit upon us, to literally baptize us in the person and in the
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   ministry of the Holy Spirit, to seal us with the Holy Spirit of God as Ephesians 1 talks about so
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:12.640]   that we are permanently indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Oh, we can grieve the Spirit. We can
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:21.200]   not be filled with His influence, but we cannot lose the Holy Spirit. We have been sealed with
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:30.800]   the Spirit and we have been given the Holy Spirit in fullest measure. This is what we pray for. This
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.280]   is what I was praying for each of you in this class and this is what I was praying for for our
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.400]   biblical counseling training. Lord, grant us biblical counselors who are filled with the
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:48.560]   Spirit of God, who have the fruit of the Spirit growing in their lives, who have the fruit of
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:55.600]   love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, so evidently growing in their lives,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.800]   who are gifted by the Spirit and who are able to minister the Word by the power of the Spirit.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:11.120]   Grant that our counseling ministry would be filled with Spirit-filled counselors. Lord,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.960]   grant us this, and that was my prayer for each of you as you work through this essay, that
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:24.160]   God would impress upon you your need to be dependent on the Holy Spirit for your life
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:30.880]   and ministry. So, as I move to page three of your notes, I want to
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:38.880]   give, as in the short time we have remaining, give you an overview of the teaching of Scripture
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:44.720]   as it relates to the role of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life. I'm going to move through some
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:51.040]   of this fairly rapidly, but I hope it'll provide a good framework for your understanding of the
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:58.560]   Holy Spirit and also a good foundation for you to write this essay. So, let's begin with the
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   promise of the Holy Spirit, Roman numeral number two on page three. This is mostly in the Old
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:15.120]   Testament. We see the promise of the Holy Spirit as you work through the Old Testament. The Old
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:22.480]   Testament prophets anticipated a time when the Holy Spirit would be poured out upon God's people.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:31.120]   In the Old Testament, we had what we now know as the Old Covenant. It was called back then the
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:39.040]   Mosaic Covenant or the Covenant of Law. This is the covenant that Israel broke time and time again
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:46.080]   through Old Testament history. There comes a point in Jeremiah chapter 31 and Ezekiel 36
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:53.600]   that God says He is going to institute a new covenant. The Old Covenant is a covenant that
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:36:02.560]   Israel broke, but God is going to establish a new covenant. He says in Ezekiel 11 verse 19,
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:09.200]   "And I will give them one heart and a new spirit I will put within them. I will remove the heart
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:17.600]   of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh." So, this was the characteristic of
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:25.360]   the New Covenant. The Old Covenant focused on the external law. The New Covenant will focus on a
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:34.800]   transformed heart, a heart of flesh that is softened to the things of God. And we find that
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:42.880]   central to the provision of the New Covenant will be the ministry of the Holy Spirit. We read Ezekiel
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:50.880]   36 verse 26, "And I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you and I'll remove
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:57.120]   the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:05.520]   and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules." In the Old Testament,
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:11.200]   the Holy Spirit would come upon certain individuals for certain tasks in ministry,
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:17.840]   but as we see in David's life, the Holy Spirit could be taken away. David prays in Psalm 51,
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.560]   "Take not thy spirit from me." But we see under the provisions of the New Covenant that there
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   would come a time when the Holy Spirit would be poured out upon God's people. And God would not
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:39.440]   only place the Spirit's ministry upon certain individuals for specific tasks of ministry,
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.600]   but he would place the Holy Spirit within the hearts of God's people.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:54.400]   And this is just beautiful language that describes the New Covenant ministry that was promised
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:02.880]   and foretold in the Old Testament. As Bruce Ware writes, "What then is the novelty of the
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.760]   future covenant? The principal novelty is, I believe, that the covenant is not written on stone
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:16.240]   but on their hearts. The location of the law in Israel was identified most prominently with
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:24.640]   tablets of stone or with a book of the law, not with tablets of human hearts." All of that would
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.440]   change with the establishment of the New Covenant. Robert Soce says this, "The New Covenant therefore
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.480]   looks to the time when the law of God would be a part of the mind and will of the people so that
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:49.280]   they obey God, not because they are supposed to, but because they want to." Now, if you've taken
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.080]   year one with me and you've been through our basic training course for biblical counseling,
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.200]   you ought to love this language because we emphasized in our training that biblical
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:06.320]   counselors focus on the heart. What we are after is heart change. What we pray for is that our
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.480]   counselees will not only behave differently, we pray that their hearts will be changed so that
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:19.280]   they would think differently, that they would desire differently. I don't just want a husband
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:26.160]   in the counseling session to say, "Fine, I'll do what you want. I'll love my wife even though I
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   don't want to." I want the Word of God to work in that husband's life and the Spirit of God to work
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:42.720]   through the Word so that the husband says, "I want nothing more than to love my wife. I want nothing
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:50.960]   more than the glory of God. Help me do that. Help me find ways to do that, but I want nothing more
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:40:00.240]   than to honor God with my marriage." We long for that. We love that because that is the ministry
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:08.480]   of the Spirit to change hearts under the provision of the new covenant. As Carl Hotch writes, the new
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:16.000]   covenant comes with batteries included. The Spirit internalizes the new covenant so that the people
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.800]   of God are motivated to do God's will. By contrast, the old covenant stood over the people of Israel
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.680]   like a judge demanding obedience but providing no enablement. By the way, that is why if I'm
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:36.480]   assured that a counselee is a believer in Christ, I can say to that counselee, "You can change.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:46.320]   You can change because you have the ministry of the Holy Spirit working in you for God's glory."
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:52.000]   So the Old Testament promised that a new covenant would be provided. Letter B,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.480]   the Old Testament promised that the Spirit would be poured out.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:05.440]   The Old Testament promised that the Spirit would be poured out. That's beautiful language,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.120]   the pouring out of the Spirit. It's what my theology professor Dr. Larry Pettigrew called
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:22.720]   a liquidy, watery metaphor that emphasizes the fullness of the Spirit's provision and person.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   Isaiah 32 verse 15, "Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high and the wilderness becomes
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:39.760]   a fruitful field and the fruitful field is deemed a forest, then justice will dwell in the wilderness
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:45.600]   and righteousness abide in the fruitful field and the effect of righteousness will be peace
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   and the result of righteousness, quietness, and trust forever." I mean, these are just
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:57.840]   beautiful passages. Isaiah 44 verse 3, "For I will pour water on the thirsty land
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:05.760]   and streams on the dry ground. I will pour my Spirit upon your offspring and my blessing
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:13.040]   on your descendants." Joel 2 verse 28, "And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:20.400]   out my Spirit on all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:27.760]   dreams and your young men shall see visions. Even on the male and female servants in those days,
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.480]   I will pour out my Spirit." So in our study, we could spend a lot more time on this, but I want
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:41.120]   to transition and just make that point that the Old Testament promised that the Holy Spirit would
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.800]   come. The Old Testament promised that the Holy Spirit would be placed in the hearts of God's
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:54.640]   people. The Old Testament promised that the Holy Spirit would be poured out upon God's people in
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:03.040]   this liquidy, watery metaphor of the fullness of blessing. We fast forward to the New Testament
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:14.480]   in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to this earth, His life, His going to the cross, and we
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.320]   fast forward to the evening before Christ's death as Jesus shares His heart with His disciples in
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:30.000]   the upper room. And in the context of all of these Old Testament promises and the expectation that
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:38.640]   the Holy Spirit would be poured out, Jesus says on the eve of His death in John 14 verse 16,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:46.480]   "I will ask the Father and He will give you another helper." Now that's good news for anyone
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:54.240]   who needs help, by the way, which is me every day and I trust is you as well. Jesus's promise
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:04.880]   is, "I will give you another helper to be with you." For how long? Jesus says, "Forever,
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:12.720]   even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:19.520]   Him, you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be." Note this, so sound familiar,
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:27.440]   "He will be with you and will be in you." Now remember, that's New Covenant language.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:35.600]   The Spirit will come to live in you. He will transform your life from the inside out.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.760]   Now that's exciting because basically the Old Testament has been saying,
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.160]   "The Holy Spirit is coming, the Holy Spirit is coming, the Holy Spirit is coming, He's going
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:51.520]   to be poured out." And on the eve of Christ's death, Jesus says to His disciples, "The Holy
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:45:00.720]   Spirit is going to be given to you." And He repeats this language in John 14 verse 26,
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:08.080]   "But the helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, He will teach you all
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:14.560]   things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace I leave with you,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:22.240]   my peace I give to you, not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled,
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:30.560]   neither let them be afraid." And John 15 verse 26 says, "But when the helper comes,
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:35.120]   whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:43.040]   He will bear witness about me." So you have the Old Testament promising that the Holy Spirit
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.400]   would be poured out. You have Jesus telling His disciples that the Holy Spirit would be given
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.960]   to them. We know that Jesus dies on the cross on Good Friday. He rises from the grave on
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:02.880]   Resurrection Sunday. He meets with His disciples in Acts chapter 1. And we move to the next page
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:11.680]   of your handout and we see Roman numeral number 3, the baptism of the Holy Spirit. All of that
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:20.000]   background and backdrop is the setting for this amazing passage in Acts chapter 1 verse 4,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.360]   where the resurrected Christ meets with His disciples and listen to the language.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:32.880]   "While staying with them," verse 4, "He ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem,
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:40.000]   but to wait for the promise of the Father, which He said, 'You heard from Me, for John baptized
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:51.760]   with water, but you will be baptized," literally immersed, "with the Holy Spirit not many days
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:47:01.040]   from now." Remember the liquidy, watery metaphor used in the Old Testament to describe the ministry
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:06.800]   of the Holy Spirit, where the Old Testament said that the Holy Spirit would be poured out
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:14.400]   upon God's people. Jesus uses another liquidy, watery metaphor referring not to water baptism,
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:22.240]   but to Spirit baptism. And He says to His disciples, "You will be baptized with the
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:31.520]   Holy Spirit," here it is, "not many days from now." How long have we waited through Old Testament
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   history for the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon God's people? We waited for generations.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:45.680]   Hundreds of years have gone by as we waited for the fulfillment of this promise that the Holy
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:51.600]   Spirit would be given to God's people. And Jesus tells His disciples in Acts chapter 1,
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:59.600]   "This is going to happen in a matter of days." I mean, just the anticipation that must have
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:06.640]   taken place in the disciples' hearts as they waited for this event to take place. And then
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:14.640]   we move to Acts chapter 2, "But when the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one
[00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:21.680]   place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.760]   entire house where they were sitting. And divided tongues of fire appeared to them and rested on
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.440]   each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:40.160]   as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.840]   nation under heaven. And at the sound the multitude came together and they were bewildered because
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:51.760]   each one was hearing them speak in his own language. And they were amazed and astonished,
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:59.680]   saying, 'Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear each of us
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:09.040]   in his own native language? Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:16.000]   and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and parts of Libya belonging
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.920]   to Cyrene and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians. We hear them
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:31.120]   telling in their own tongues the mighty works of God.' And all were amazed and perplexed, saying
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:37.920]   to one another, 'What does this mean?' But others mocking said, 'They are filled with new wine.'
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:44.640]   And the question would be this, is this the fulfillment of the Old Testament promise
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.480]   that the Holy Spirit would be poured out upon God's people?
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:58.240]   And the answer is found in verse 16. But this is what is offered through the prophet Joel.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:05.120]   And in the last days it shall be God declares that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.160]   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy even on your my male servants and female servants
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:18.480]   in those days. I will pour out my spirit and they shall prophesy. So the filling of the spirit and
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:25.520]   the baptism of the spirit and the pouring out of the spirit is all that is language that is referring
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:34.560]   to this great event, the day of Pentecost, where the spirit was poured out upon the early church
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:44.720]   and the church was born. It was launched as a new spiritual organism that was birthed by the power
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.280]   of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. And the tongues, the known languages that the people
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:59.200]   were speaking were an emblem of the mission of the church, that the church would take the gospel of
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:05.360]   the Lord Jesus Christ to every tribe and every language and every nation. No longer would the
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:13.840]   messages of God be spoken only in Hebrew, but the gospel of Christ would be spoken in languages
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:21.520]   that would extend to the entire Gentile world. This is what we call the grand opening
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:30.960]   of the church era. It is a massive transition that's taking place in Acts chapter 2.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:38.320]   The day of Pentecost represents the inauguration of the church age. The day of Pentecost, Acts
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:44.720]   chapter 2, represents the inauguration of new covenant blessings. What we are seeing here is
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:53.760]   the pouring out or what Jesus referred to as the baptism, the immersion of the people of God into
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:00.880]   the Holy Spirit and the spirit coming to live inside the people of God. We see major transitions
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:07.920]   being made in Acts chapter 2 from old covenant provisions to new covenant provisions. The
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:13.920]   transition from the nation of Israel being the focal point of God's plan to the unique organism
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:20.800]   of the church which incorporates Jew and Gentile being the focal point of God's plan to exalt
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:28.720]   himself among the nations. We see a transition from the focus on the Jews to a focus being upon
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:38.080]   the Gentile world. We see a massive transition being made of the word of God being spoken only
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:45.360]   in Hebrew to speaking the word of God in the languages of all the nations. This is the grand
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:54.560]   opening of the new covenant era which is the era of the spirit of God living in his people.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:04.400]   Larry Pettigrew writes this, the Old Testament Pentecost celebrated the actual use of the
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:11.440]   completed grain harvest. The Israelites officially began to cook and eat of the grain that they had
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.400]   been harvesting for more than a month and a half. They were now officially and personally
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   benefiting from the provisions. Similarly, the New Testament Pentecost celebrated the actual
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.120]   functioning of all of the benefits that Christ had prepared during the past month and a half.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:36.000]   The very son of God at the cross had objectively made the atonement. The old covenant had come to
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.920]   an end when the veil was ripped in two from the top to the bottom. With Pentecost, all of these
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:49.840]   great provisions became operational and personally beneficial for those who were believers in Christ.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   The day of Pentecost was as it were the divine starting gun of a new era. The new covenant was
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:10.560]   officially functional. Bang and they are off to the races. And we see for the first time in
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:20.640]   redemptive history, this new organism called the body of Christ, combining Jew and Gentile in one
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:26.480]   body. First Corinthians 12 verse 12, for just as the body is one and has many members and all
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:31.600]   the members of the body, though many are one body. So it is with Christ for in one spirit,
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:41.520]   we were all baptized into one body, Jew or Greek, slave or free, and all were made to drink of one
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:48.960]   spirit. And that leads us to Roman numeral number four. And you're going to like this point.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:56.640]   You're going to need to use this in your ministry as I need to use this in my ministry. The spirit
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:06.480]   as our helper, the spirit as our helper. When you get into counseling ministry, you're going to
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:12.640]   realize that you need a lot of help. And so do I. You're going to need a lot of help to work
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:18.480]   through the issues. You're going to need a lot of help to discern what the counselor is dealing
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.720]   with. You're going to need a lot of help discerning what scriptures to use, how many sessions to
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.920]   schedule. You're going to need a lot of help to continue to love your counselee when your
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.640]   counselee tries your patience or misses meetings or doesn't do their homework.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:40.160]   You're going to need a lot of help just as you need a lot of help in every ministry
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:48.240]   in the church. And here is our confidence. Jesus says in John 14 verse 16, I will ask
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:57.280]   the father and he will give you another helper. The word helper comes from the Greek term
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:05.680]   parakletos. That word is derived from two words alongside and called. Literally, it means called
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   alongside to help. And the word another, alos, means another of the same kind as opposed to heteros,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:23.360]   meaning another of a different kind. Jay Packer puts it this way. Parakletos in Greek means
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:31.920]   comforter, counselor, helper, advocate, strengthener, supporter. Jesus, the original
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.720]   paraklete, continues his ministry to mankind through the work of the second paraklete.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.520]   The Holy Spirit is said to hear, speak, witness, convince, glorify Christ, lead, guide, teach,
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:53.040]   command, forbid, desire, give speech, give help, and intercede for Christians with inarticulate
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:57:00.880]   groans, himself crying to God in their prayers. He is another paraklete continuing Jesus's own
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   ministry. And only a person, one like Jesus, could do that. The Son is parakletos, Sinclair Ferguson
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:20.160]   writes. The Spirit is alos parakletos. Both function as parakletes and do so successively
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:27.680]   in the earthly realm, the Spirit being another of the same kind as the Son. Thus, to have the Spirit
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.600]   is to have Christ, to have Christ is to have the Spirit.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:45.680]   Do you need direction? The Holy Spirit will lead you. Do you need encouragement? The Holy Spirit
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:52.800]   will give you hope. Are you struggling with sin? Walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:58:00.960]   the desire of the strength. Are you weary and do you need strength for the journey? The Holy Spirit
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:11.120]   has come to empower you for life and ministry. The Holy Spirit will take a narcissist and turn
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:20.480]   him into a loving person. The Holy Spirit will take a depressed person and give him joy in life
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.520]   and in ministry. The Spirit will take an anxious person and give that person the peace that
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:32.320]   surpasses all understanding. The Spirit will take an angry person and give that person patience.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:41.680]   The Spirit will take a sarcastic person, a hurtful person, a mean person, a person with
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:51.600]   bad manners and will make that person into a man or a woman who is marked by gentleness, kindness,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:59.280]   faithfulness, and self-control. Whatever you need, the Holy Spirit has come to be our helper
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:12.400]   and Jesus says he will be with you forever. So life in the church is life in the Spirit.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   We're to be filled with the Spirit. Ephesians chapter 5 verse 18, we're to be led by the
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:26.400]   Spirit. Galatians chapter 5 verse 18, we're to be filled with the fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:34.960]   verse 22, we are to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit. Galatians chapter 5 verse 25.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:45.680]   And can I add one point here that one of the ministries of the Holy Spirit is to be our teacher.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:56.160]   He is the Spirit of truth who Jesus said will bring to your remembrance all that I have said
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:06.480]   to you. The Holy Spirit teaches us the Word of God. 1 Corinthians 2 verse 12, we have received
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:12.160]   not the Spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God that we might understand the things
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.640]   freely given us by God. And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:28.320]   the Spirit interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual. We have the inspiration of the
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:35.200]   Holy Spirit which is a completed act which results in the written revelation of God found in the 66
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.280]   books of the Bible, the scriptures. And then we have the illumination of the Holy Spirit which
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:48.720]   is the Spirit's ongoing work where the Spirit takes the written revelation of God and He changes
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:56.560]   hearts and lives through the Word of God for God's glory. You can read of the distinguishing
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:05.360]   of that in Greg Heisser's work. But I'll just note this, that when I pray for the Holy Spirit to
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:12.400]   teach me, I am not praying for additional revelation. I am not praying for the Holy
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:19.440]   Spirit to inspire new texts. I'm not praying for an additional Word of God. What I'm praying for
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:26.000]   when I ask the Holy Spirit to teach me is that God would use His all-sufficient Word to change
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.480]   my life. That the Holy Spirit would help me understand what His written Word says.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:39.600]   And then in light of what the Bible teaches, that the Holy Spirit would convict me of where I need
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:47.440]   to change and to do a renewing work in my life through His Word to make me more like Christ.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.320]   As Bob Stein has written, "Illumination is the process whereby the Holy Spirit so impresses,
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:01.920]   convinces, and convicts the believer as to the truthfulness and significance of the author's
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:08.960]   intended meaning in the text, that a change in action, attitude, or belief occurs, resulting in
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:17.200]   a more transformed spirit-filled life." We don't need additional written revelation. What we do
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:24.240]   need is for the Spirit to take what the Spirit has inspired already, the written revelation of
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:30.320]   God in the Scriptures, and to use that written revelation to convict us of sin, to help us to
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.240]   see where we need to change, where we need to repent, and to change our hearts through that Word,
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:42.480]   not apart from the Scriptures, but through the Scriptures, to change God's Word,
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.720]   to change, I'm sorry, our hearts through His Word for God's glory.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:58.160]   And so this is the distinction of inspiration and illumination. All that to say that whenever I
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.080]   stand in a public to preach or whenever I teach God's Word, I have God's inspired written Word,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:12.640]   the 66 books of the Bible, which is sufficient. And I also pray that the Holy Spirit would use
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:21.360]   that Word in that moment to change the hearts of those who hear God's Word so that they would be
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:28.080]   renewed, transformed, that they would be changed, and that they would live for God's glory. So we
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:36.640]   have this twin focus in counseling ministry. We rely upon the sufficient Word of God. We don't
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:44.960]   need any additional revelation. But we do pray for our counselees that their hearts would be
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:52.160]   changed through God's Word. Father, would you do a work in my counselee's life through the ministry
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:57.200]   of your Spirit? Would you use your Word in my counselee's life so that this hard-hearted husband
[01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:06.560]   would see the hardness of heart and repent and be broken through your Word and come to see his need
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:15.280]   of repentance so he would love his wife? Father, would you do that through your Word, not apart
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:24.400]   from it, but using your Word? Would you convict this counselee of his need for change so that
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:32.640]   we would see life change to the glory of God? So let me boil this down. Practically,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.040]   to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the knowledge of the scriptures that the Spirit
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.920]   has inspired. Practically speaking, to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the Spirit's
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.600]   thoughts, the Spirit's influence, the Spirit's perspectives on life, the Spirit's priorities,
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   the Spirit's desires. And he fills us with that influence practically as we learn and we study
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:08.400]   and we meditate on the written Word of God that he has inspired. Someone used the illustration. I
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:17.200]   think it's a helpful one that to be taught by the Spirit is like sitting down with a math textbook
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:24.800]   and have the professor who wrote the textbook teach you what is in the book.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.600]   The professor is going to teach you what is in the book because he wrote the book.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:39.680]   And yet he has come to teach you what is in the book he has written. And in a similar way,
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:50.400]   the Spirit teaches us what he has inspired in the text of scripture. That is why biblical
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:57.920]   counseling, we say this, is Spirit-filled counseling. You don't have to choose. Am I
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.040]   going to be a biblical counselor or a Spirit-filled counselor? You can and you should be both.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:10.640]   You should be filled with the scripture and be filled with the Spirit. And in the end,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:18.800]   that's why we have confidence in this ministry. It's not because we're impressive. It's not
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:25.680]   because we're that smart. It's not because we have talents or we have eloquence or we know what to
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.640]   say at all the right times. It's not because we have all of this amazing ability to analyze all
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:41.760]   the facts and information. We have confidence simply because we have the Holy Spirit and the
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:50.560]   world does not. We live with this humble yet joyful anticipation that our biblical counseling
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:56.480]   ministry is going to be fruitful, that the Spirit is going to use you and the Spirit is going to use
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:07.600]   me to change people's lives. We are going to see the Spirit work because we're simply submitting
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:17.040]   to him, to his purpose, his passion, his desires for people. And so I trust you will have a
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.240]   wonderful time writing this essay. I trust that this overview was helpful in your thinking.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:28.080]   Definitely do your own reading on this. Use this as an opportunity to refresh your own
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.920]   understanding of the ministry of the Holy Spirit and renew your personal dependence on the Spirit's
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:42.000]   role in ministry. And I trust you'll have a wonderful week of study and apply pen to paper
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.800]   and articulate your own convictions of how you would communicate this to a counselee and that
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.840]   this will be a life-changing study for you as it has been for me. Let me close us in prayer
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:04.080]   and devote the fruit of this time to the Lord. Father, we do thank you so much that you have
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:12.800]   given us your Holy Spirit. We thank you that your Spirit fills us with his influence, his fruit.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:23.920]   We thank you that the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, and so on is the result of
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   your Spirit working in our lives. We want to see more of that fruit. We want to see more hearts
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:39.920]   and lives changed for the glory of Christ. And we want to submit to the Spirit's purpose in this day
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:48.880]   and age to bring people to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and to help people to see the glory of
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:59.200]   your Son. And so, Father, we pray that we might live by the Spirit. We pray that our ministry
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:05.520]   would be a demonstration of the Spirit's power, not a demonstration of human eloquence or wisdom.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:14.560]   And we pray that our knowledge of the Spirit's work in this day would lead us to embrace ever
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.720]   more the sufficiency of your Word, that we may embrace the truth that your Spirit always works
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:27.280]   through the Scriptures, not apart from the Scriptures. The Spirit's business in this day
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:36.240]   is not to lead us to extra-biblical words of so-called revelation, but to bring our hearts
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:43.680]   and our lives in submission to the written revelation of God in the 66 books of the Bible.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   So help us, Father, to process these things. Help my brothers and sisters to write an excellent essay
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:57.520]   on this topic that would be used in years, Lord willing, to come to bless others. And we just
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.480]   commit this time to you and thank you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Well, thank you all for joining
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.120]   us tonight. As I mentioned in my email, we have the larger goal of completing all 24 theology
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:18.640]   exams by December. And so we are not going to meet for class next week. I'm going to be traveling
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.400]   next Sunday, and so we won't be able to meet next week. But we will regather the following Sunday
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.560]   on November 15th, and we'll do theology exam number 22. We'll wrap up the exams in the month
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.760]   of December, and we'll take a winter break. And those of you who are continuing on to
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   the counseling essays, we will reconvene in January and go through the counseling essays
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.640]   together. But thanks so much for joining us tonight. May the Lord bless you. Have a wonderful
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:51.300]   week and thank you again for your faith.
