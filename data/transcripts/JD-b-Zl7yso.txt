[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Let me get everything queued up here.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500]   How does J. Cal open the show?
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500]   What does he say?
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500]   Hey, everybody.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500]   Do it, Chamath.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   Hey, everybody. Hey, everybody. I'm Jason Calacanis.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500]   I am the grifter with the mostest.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500]   The mostest, that's the shortest.
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500]   The shortest, that's the fattest.
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500]   And the fattest, that's the dumbest.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500]   [laughter]
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500]   He's not even here. You can't do that. It's awful.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   [laughter]
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   [music]
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500]   Great open, Chamath.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   Where is J. Cal?
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500]   He wanted the week off.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500]   And any time any of us take the week off,
[00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500]   J. Cal says, "The show must go on."
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500]   And he rings up Brad Gerstner and says,
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500]   "Hey, we need a sub. Come on in this week."
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   This week, when J. Cal wanted the week off,
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500]   he said, "Guys, we're all taking the week off."
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500]   And Sac said, "The show must go on."
[00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500]   J. Cal refused to show up.
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   His producer/editor refused to show up.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500]   So we are here solo hacking our way
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500]   to All In Pod, episode 136.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   As your moderator today, Dave Friedberg,
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.500]   I am extraordinarily joyous and happy
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   to bring you the first episode of the All In Podcast
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.500]   without the hostess with the mostess, Jason Calacanis.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500]   Joining me today, Il Duce from Elba Island,
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   Chamath Palihapitiya.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500]   Chamath firing up tweet storms lately,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500]   taking over the Twitter,
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500]   soon to take the threads by storm, I'm sure.
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   Rain Man, David Sacks,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   joining us from a curtain showroom
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   in the south of wherever.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   And from an attic in an old house,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500]   the man who manages $10 billion
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   to generate 50% plus returns year to date,
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   the one and only Brad Gerstner.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   Brad, welcome to the show.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   Great to have you.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   - Good to be here.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   Appreciate the call, half hour ago.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   - Yeah, great.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.500]   - Are we even gonna be able to drop this episode?
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   How are we gonna actually upload it
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   to Apple Podcasts and all the rest?
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   - Okay, so here's the deal.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   I have the email login.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500]   I think I can get into the accounts.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   (laughing)
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   I'm gonna like do the request for password reset
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   on all the accounts.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   - Oh my God.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   - I also have iMovie on my computer.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   So I'm gonna use iMovie to edit it.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   It's gonna be fantastic.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   I'll send you guys a little link before.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   I'm gonna create a Descript account
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   so we can edit our show and comment on it.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   I'll see how that works.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   - So the show is just magically gonna appear
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   on YouTube and Apple Podcasts
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   and J Cal's gonna be like, "What happened?"
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   - Exactly.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   So let's not tell what Freeberg is.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   Freeberg is Bernard Arnault
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   during the takeover of LVMH,
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   which is a great story if you've never heard about it.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   - I'd love to hear it.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   - He basically is like, he says he's gonna partner
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   with this Irish entrepreneur to basically buy LVMH.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   And they're going through, and at the 11th hour,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   he pulls a rug out from him, stabs him in the back,
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   basically does the deal himself,
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   gets to own LVMH, and the rest is history.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   But this is you, Freeberg.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.500]   You're pulling a Bernard Arnault at the last minute.
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   - No, no, I would never stab J Cal in the back.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   I would just steal his passwords.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   - Oh, you would stab him in the front.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   You'd stab him in the front.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   - Yeah, I would stab him in the front.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   I'd call him, tell him you should show up to work,
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   stab him in the front, and steal the passwords.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   - It's not stabbing in the front.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   We showed up, he didn't.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.500]   - Yeah.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   - He's trying to exercise
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   passive-aggressive control over the pod.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   He's been outvoted.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   He does not control the pod.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   - We've done 135 episodes,
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   and every time we've suggested
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   taking a week off as a group,
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   and he doesn't want to, he says,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   "The show must go on,"
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   and he calls up a guest,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   and he keeps the show going
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   at his whim and his discretion.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   So this week, we are doing the same.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.500]   The show must go on.
[00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   J Cal is enjoying a summer break,
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   wherever he is.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.500]   I think we're all on vacation this week, right?
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   - I know why he didn't want the show to go on
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   is he has a deep insecurity
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500]   that he might get replaced at some point.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   - Yeah.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   - By someone smarter than him.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   - Oh. - So.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   - Oh.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   Oh.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   - Gerstner, you were supposed to replace me,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   but you might end up replacing J Cal.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   - No, no, no.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.500]   - The fans will just have to let us know.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   - No, Friedrich, the truth is,
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   the truth is last year,
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.500]   remember, the fateful morning
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   when I get a call from Chema,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   and he said, "Hey,
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   we need you to come in.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   J Cal's out.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.500]   We got [bleep]
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   and we need you in as the fourth."
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   And as I'm talking to Chema,
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   my phone rings,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   and it's J Cal.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500]   And he said, "Friedberg's out.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.500]   We need you to replace him."
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   I had both guys going at the same time.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   And it's been that way for the last 12 months.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.500]   - So can I just say-- - It's literally like billions.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   - Yeah, I was in Vegas
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   with [bleep]
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   when I had to sort this out.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   It burned an entire day.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   A year ago. It was a year ago.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   - Well, at least we got our--
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   At least we got our LLC docs signed.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   That's what came out of it.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   - It's literally like the show "Billions."
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   You know?
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   With all the intrigue or whatever.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   But that's why J Cal wanted to sabotage the show
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   rather than have it go on without him,
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   'cause he's afraid that the audience
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500]   might like the show better without him.
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   There's certainly been a lot of commenters
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   saying that sort of thing.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   So I guess we're gonna find out.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   The fans need to let us know
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   what they think of this episode.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.500]   - All right, well, let's kick it off.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   First topic on the docket today,
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   which I think is a great one,
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   and Chema, if you've been tweeting a lot lately
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   as we just talked about,
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500]   I think that'll end up probably being our cold open.
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500]   But Zuck announced--
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   Facebook, Meta, announced the launch of Threads.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   Gerstner, big shareholder of Meta, I think, right?
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   Reasonably-sized shareholder.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   This--Zuck this morning announced
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   30 million downloads of the app overnight.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   Threads is Instagram/Facebook/Meta's
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   competitor to Twitter.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   Looks almost like a clone.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   I mean, it is so similar in features,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   in interaction, in everything.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.500]   Brad, maybe you can kick us off
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.500]   and talk a little bit about the importance of Threads
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   and how this is important to Meta,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   and then we can talk a little bit about the app itself.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   - Well, I mean, the first thing is,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.500]   if rumors are true,
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   they developed this over a period of six to nine months
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.500]   with 20 people, okay?
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.500]   And so the extraordinary pace
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.500]   that's now occurring with inside--or inside Meta--
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   we've heard from several people inside
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   that said people are pumped.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   They're actually updating real-time user counts.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   There are over 30 million users already on Instagram.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.500]   And it just gets back to this culture
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500]   of flattening the organization,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   speeding up the organization.
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   I think everybody's excited.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   You know, the best engineers in the world
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.500]   want to see their products set free.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   And so, you know, I think Threads is really interesting
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.500]   for a couple reasons.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   Number one, if we flash back to what went on in China
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500]   with Toutiao and Douyuan,
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   remember that text-based social networks
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   were where kind of it started there.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.500]   And so it's a bit anomalous.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   Douyuan, which is the TikTok equivalent in China,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   was started based on Toutiao,
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   which was a text-based news feed.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   And so it doesn't surprise me
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   to see the social graph being leveraged
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   into a text-based feed.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   I think initially they're seeding it,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   obviously, with all your friends.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   So it looks more like celebs and entertainment.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.500]   And my team is like, "It's easier to use.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   It's faster. It feels more free."
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   I think, you know, Adam Asari,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   he posted on Threads that he stayed up all night last night,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   so excited with a product launch.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   He and Zuck are responding to people
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   actually live on Threads.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.500]   And so part of this just goes to the pulse
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   of the company.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   Over the next four to six weeks,
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   they're going to have massive launches
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   out of the AI side of the business.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   I expect a lot more support for their OpenAI model
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.500]   or for their OpenLLM.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   I also think they're going to launch a bunch of agents
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   on WhatsApp and Instagram.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.500]   So what I see is just velocity and cycle time
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   within the business improving.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   And then one final thing,
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   in the age of AI, right,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.500]   you want to collect as much data
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   as you can from your users.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.500]   And we know that Facebook is very heavy
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   on video and pictures.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   But what they're light on is text.
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   And so in a world where the most important thing
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500]   on the internet to train your model
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   is the word, right,
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   now they're going to collect a lot of words,
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   a lot of conversations,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   a lot of sentiment among the users.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   And, you know, maybe we'll come back to this.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.500]   You know, I just want to kick it back
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   and get people's thoughts on the product.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   But already, by my estimate,
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   if these guys get to 100 million,
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   which it looks like they may be able to get to tonight,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.500]   based upon the monetization that Twitter has,
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   that's already a business that's doing something
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.500]   like $2.5 billion in revenue
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   if they chose to monetize it,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   $1.2 or $1.5 billion in EBIT,
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   apply their current multiple to that,
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   that's about a $20 billion increase
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   in enterprise value built by,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   if rumors are true,
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   20 people over a course of six months.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.500]   - Yeah, it's pretty impressive.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   I remember in the early days of Friendster
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.500]   and MySpace and then even Facebook,
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.500]   these social networks launched
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   and everyone thought it was going to be
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.500]   a conversational system.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   And so much of the usage and the page views
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   and the minutes spent ultimately accrued
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.500]   to photos and over time video.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   And now it's almost like this interesting reversion
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.500]   back to the origin that it's back
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.500]   to this conversational system.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   But these systems always seem to kind of evolve
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   to, hey, just images are what win
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.500]   and what kind of gather up all the mind space.
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.500]   I mean, Shamma, having worked at Facebook,
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500]   maybe you can share a little bit
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.500]   about your point of view on threads as a product
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   and as an evolution away from social network
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.500]   on Facebook to Instagram and now to threads.
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.500]   - I think what people don't understand
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   is that the successful category winner
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   in each of these categories
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   needed to invent something de novo
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   that nobody else had.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   In the case of Facebook,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   we invented photo tagging when it didn't exist.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   And then we invented the newsfeed
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.500]   when it didn't exist.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.500]   And then there was a bunch of people that copied it,
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   but it didn't matter because we had refined
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   and owned that use case already.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.500]   So I think the real challenge for Facebook isn't
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   can 20 people copy Twitter?
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.500]   I mean, you know, Mastodon is a copy of Twitter.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   There's a bunch of parlors, a copy of Twitter.
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   Truth Social is a copy of Twitter.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   The challenge is going to be,
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   can you invent some de novo feature
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   that makes people actually want to use this?
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   And, you know, rage quitting Twitter
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   because you're not a fan of the product right now
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   or Elon isn't a successful long-term use case
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   because all of those people will eventually come back.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   So I don't know.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   I'm a little bit more skeptical of the whole thing.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.500]   I think that right now what you see is
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   not even a full copy of the system.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   It's, you know, a 50, 60% copy with a lot less usage.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   And so as a result, a lot less traffic.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   But I think you need something new.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500]   You know, TikTok, the reason why it became successful
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   was it was a fundamentally new use case
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.500]   relative to the alternatives.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.500]   And I think that that captures people's imagination
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   and mindshare.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.500]   So this is not what Threads does.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   And so in as much as it's a copy of something
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.500]   that is already an established behavior,
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   I don't think it has very high chances of success.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.500]   - But don't Stories and Reels undermine that argument?
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   I mean, Reels was a copy of TikTok
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.500]   and Stories was a copy of Snapchat
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   and they're both giant products today.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.500]   - I think that you can definitely copy features
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   into an existing product with new distribution,
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.500]   but to invent a new product fully from scratch,
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   that's a carbon copy of something.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500]   But again, Reels attaches onto Instagram,
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   which is a unique use case, right?
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   And so I think that, again, it goes back to,
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   you have these five or six established modes
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   of social media that essentially are
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   from large pieces of content to small pieces.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.500]   That's probably the best organizing principle
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   that we have.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   And then that's one axis.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   And the other axis is text, video, audio.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   And along that spectrum,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   you can basically compartmentalize all these things.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500]   And then there are about four of them that have real scale.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   And so in as much as you have established distribution,
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.500]   yes, you can copy a feature from somebody else
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   and it will get used, but that's not what this is.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   So if this instead gets integrated into Instagram,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   I think it's much more dangerous to Twitter
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   than as a standalone product.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.500]   As a standalone product, I tend to think it's DOA
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.500]   for the most part.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.500]   Unless again, it invents something totally new
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.500]   that we're missing.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   - Sax, you're an advisor to Twitter.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   What do you advise Elon?
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   And how do you think about this as a competitive threat?
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.500]   - Yeah, I'm not a formal advisor to Twitter.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500]   I was just a guy hanging around during the transition.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.500]   Now, look, I mean, I tend to agree with Chamath.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.500]   The thing that Facebook did really well here
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.500]   is there's a one-click signup flow from Instagram
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.500]   where you just click to download threads
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   and then you can log in with your Instagram account
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   and port over your bio and all of your data
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.500]   and your social graph.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   So it's super easy to get set up,
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   but by the same token, if they have 10 million
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   or even 30 million signups,
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   that's really just a 3% conversion rate
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.500]   on the billion users that Instagram has.
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   So a lot of people are just gonna make that click
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   because they're curious.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   They wanna find out what threads is.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   I wouldn't be surprised if they got 100 million users
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   or 200 million users that way,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   just people clicking over from Instagram
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   to see what this new thing is.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500]   The question is,
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.500]   what's gonna be the habit-forming behavior here?
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   And the people who use Twitter
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   are really addicted to using Twitter.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   It's where the conversation is.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   There is a strong network effect there,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   not just around the users and the social graph,
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.500]   but like the habit of daily usage.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   So how many of these people who are signing up
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   are actually gonna go use it every day?
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   Are they gonna take the time to copy over,
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   to kind of copy paste all of their Twitter posts
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   over to this new medium?
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   And then what about all the comments, replies?
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.500]   So I wouldn't just look at the signups here.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   I think you have to look at the amount of posting
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   and the actual usage
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   before you know that Twitter has a threat.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   - Right.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500]   Did any of you guys use it this morning or last night?
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.500]   - Yes.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   - No.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   - I mean, what'd you think about the UX?
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   - We had our team playing with it all morning
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   and I started sharing with you.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.500]   It feels to our team like common words being used
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   were snappier, faster, lower hurdle.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   Like it felt more fun and social.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   Therefore, it wasn't as considered a post, right?
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   Because most of the posts,
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   at least that our team engages in on Twitter
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.500]   are for mostly business purposes, right?
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   And so there's politics and business
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   and more serious topics, right?
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500]   Instagram's the home for fun.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   It's for frivolity.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.500]   It's showing pictures of your friends.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   And so I think it's going to orient more in that direction.
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.500]   And again, there's probably room in the world
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.500]   for a text-based social network around entertainment
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   and culture and food and the fun stuff.
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   And there's probably room for one
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   that's more about politics and business
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   and more serious topics.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   And perhaps they'll converge more over time.
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   I think it's an interesting thing.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   Yes, it's one click,
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   but you have to download a new app.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.500]   I mean, this isn't just open up your Instagram
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   and all of a sudden click on a new tab, right?
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   And by my account,
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   I think it's just in the US that they launched this.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   So their conversion rate's probably over 10% already
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.500]   in 24 hours.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   And you got to download an app to get there.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   That feels to me like a little bit more of a hurdle,
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   but I agree with both of you.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   At the end of the day,
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   it's going to be about engagement,
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.500]   not about how many people you got to download the app.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   And if they get high engagement,
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   and I think there's plenty of surface area
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.500]   for these guys to monetize,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.500]   that combined with, Chamath pointed out,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500]   as much as we love Elon,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   certainly there are people, Chamath,
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.500]   you brought up with respect to Tesla,
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.500]   that are orienting away because of the brand.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.500]   Like it may make sense or not,
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   but we know it's happening.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   And so I do think that there's a natural momentum.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   I think this was,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   like if this was the cage match, right?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.500]   If this was the MMA between the two of them,
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.500]   this is certainly an offensive blow
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   that Meta just landed here.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.500]   And I expect that it's going to amp up the heat.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.500]   - So it's interesting because at the same time
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   as Threads is launching to compete with Twitter,
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   there's some really interesting data coming out
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.500]   showing declining usage of chat GPT
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.500]   and interest level in BARD.
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500]   So both if you look at Google Trends,
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   as well as data coming out of SimilarWeb,
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   which tracks usage across sites,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.500]   chat GPT usage seems to be falling
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   from a peak in May.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   And it had a modest increase from March to April,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500]   and then an even less modest increase from April to May.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   And May to June, we're actually seeing a decline in usage.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   The question is, is this driven by educational usage?
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   So a lot of kids were using chat GPT to write essays
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.500]   and to use it in school,
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   and that seems to be a primary use case.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   Or does it speak to a more broad kind of challenge
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   with chat GPT really disrupting search
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   and disrupting other ways that people are kind of accessing
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   and browsing the internet that as an interface,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   maybe it's a little bit too challenged.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   And it doesn't replace the simple two word keyword click
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.500]   and click on the result.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.500]   I'd love your guys' point of view on the product
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   and the experience, as well as why do we think
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   that there's declining usage in chat GPT?
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   - Well, you had these products launch in a moment
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.500]   where there was in many ways a usage vacuum.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   What I mean by that is if you look back
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   over like the last 15 or 20 years,
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   there were these waves that would create
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   these layers of innovation that consumers
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.500]   would get infatuated with and try.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   It actually came right on the heels
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   of a pretty massive head fake, which was around VR.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.500]   And that was supposed to be this next big tidal wave
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.500]   of consumer innovation, which turned out to be
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.500]   just a total fart in the wind.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   And so I think that there was a setup here
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   where consumers were hankering for something
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   really interesting and unique and new and novel.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   A lot of people wrap those labels around
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   the chat versions of these LLMs.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:33.500]   And so you had, again, this explosion of usage,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.500]   but I think what we're going to find there
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   is that there's some pretty useful use cases,
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   but narrow where these chat interfaces are very useful
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.500]   and the usage will decay to that number.
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.500]   And that number is probably a fraction
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   of what the peak was.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   So then people will get disillusioned
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   and the press will say, this was another fad
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500]   from Silicon Valley.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   But then I think the reality is that the real stuff,
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   which is around enterprise software, healthcare,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   the physical sciences, that's where the real AI leaps,
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   I think will have really momentous value.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   Those are still 18 to 24 to 36 months away
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500]   from seeing the light of day in terms of real products
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   that actually work.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   So yeah, again, it's part of the hype cycle
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   and we all kind of fell for it.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   The only winner here is Nvidia.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   I think the loser here are most of the VCs
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   who pumped in hundreds of millions to billions of dollars
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   and rando stuff too early.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   And the consumers, they tried it, they didn't like it,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.500]   they moved on, they're waiting for the next thing.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   - Zach, agree, disagree?
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   - Well, I think that's going a little bit too far.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.500]   I mean, I think that there may be a couple
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   of things going on here.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.500]   One is that the curiosity factor may have been played out.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   I mean, the novelty has worn off a little bit.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   I think there was a lot of people using it initially
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.500]   just to see what it could do and hearing about it
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   and wanting to test it out.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.500]   So I think people have sort of scratched that itch.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.500]   Also school is now out of session.
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.500]   So for all the people who are using it
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.500]   to do some kind of academic research,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   there's not a need to do that right now.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.500]   I do agree that the use cases that are most exciting to me
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.500]   are enterprise uses.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.500]   And I agree with Chamath about that.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   And I think that is all still to come.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.500]   I think in terms of the consumer,
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   I don't think it's going away,
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   but I think that they're gonna have to improve
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   the accuracy, they're gonna have to improve
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.500]   the performance, the speed of it,
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   maybe improve the interface, add some more features
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   if they wanna get to the next level of usage.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   - I mean, think about the product today.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.500]   You know, 100 million downloads.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.500]   The whole downtick here is explained
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.500]   by kids being out of school.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   I mean, it's down 10% and like kids have to be more
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   than 20% of the usage of this thing, I would think.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   So I think you set that aside,
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500]   but just think about how hard it is to use this product.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   Right?
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500]   Most people, you have 4 million people
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.500]   paying 20 bucks a month.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   Could you imagine people paying 20 bucks a month
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500]   to use Google?
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   Then on top of that, try downloading plugins.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   It's still a pain in the ass.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   And if you don't have a plugin,
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500]   I think there are only 500,000 people using plugin.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   If you don't have a plugin, you have no new data past 2021,
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   which makes it dead on arrival as a product.
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   So I don't even think, I think we're so early in this
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   that to judge the chat interface based upon the product
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.500]   that exists today, I think it's a huge mistake.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   I think that what we're going to see is kids come back
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   to school, you're going to see the normal uptick in traffic.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.500]   It probably hangs out around this 100 million,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   150 million level in terms of usage.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   I think the next 10X for a chat-based interface,
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.500]   at least as it, insofar as it concerns the consumer,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   is when we move from information retrieval to action.
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   And you've heard Zuckerberg talk about this
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   on the Lex Friedman podcast.
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   You've heard Meta talk about this outside of that context.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   And then you've heard Mustafa talk about it from Pi,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   which is this idea that I say, hey,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   show me the five best hotels in Milan.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.500]   It shows you five hotels, and then you say, book me,
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   the Cipriani for these dates.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   And it actually will book it directly with the hotel,
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   engaging with an agent there.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.500]   Now, Mustafa from Pi says this is months away.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   Zuckerberg alludes to the fact that they're going to have
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500]   action bots on WhatsApp and Instagram
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   in the not-too-distant future.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   I think all of the links exist in the world to do this today.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.500]   So I would say look for that as the next 10X feature
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   for consumer-facing chatbots.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   And then finally, I'd just say,
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   I was at the Snowflake Summit last week.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   There were 600 applications, so new startups,
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.500]   that applied for their startup contest.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   They were each using an application of ChatGPT
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   built on top of Snowflake data.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.500]   600 new companies, and they just launched
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   their application layer.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.500]   So there's a tremendous appetite for people
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   to help enterprises access that information
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   and build much more seamless discovery on top of it.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   I tried to use ChatGPT, the mobile app, on July 4th.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   I was just trying to find a good quote to use
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   by an American patriot or founder,
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   or framer of the Constitution, something like that,
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   to tweet out for July 4th, and it just errored out on me.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   And it was one of these error messages
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   that you can tell an engineer wrote.
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   It's this totally non-anticipated error.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   And I tried it two or three different ways,
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   a couple of different chat threads.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   It just didn't work.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   It's completely inexplicable.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   So when you have those kinds of experiences,
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   it makes you just want to go to Google,
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   which is what I did.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.500]   I actually went to Google to find what I was looking for.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.500]   I thought ChatGPT could do a better job
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.500]   because I thought it could help me find things
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   that would be specifically appropriate for July 4th.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   So I was curious to see what opinion it might have.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.500]   But Google is just much more performant.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.500]   So they have to work out those kinks.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.500]   I mean, that's pretty clear.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.500]   I think natural language prediction as a capability
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.500]   is certainly here to stay,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.500]   along with the agents and the action bots
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500]   that can integrate behind the scenes
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   to do things for you.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500]   The real question for me is,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.500]   is this a winner interface?
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   If I think back to user interfaces,
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   user experience in the history of computing,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   we can kind of go back to the original terminal interface
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   on DOS, and you would have lines that you would type,
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   and you would kind of program the computer to do stuff.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   That was almost like the first real computing interface
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.500]   that people could use.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   And then there was Windows.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   And when Windows came along, it was a new type of interface,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   a new type of interaction model.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   And then we had the icons that arose
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.500]   with the iPad/iPhone revolution.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.500]   And obviously the internet, the browser, was a new UX.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   And the browser provided hyperlinks.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   And in one window, you would click through
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   and go to lots of different things.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   And then that browser interface eventually integrated images
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   and video.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   And then the interface that we're almost used to lately
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   that we all probably spend most of our time on
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   is the scrolling interface,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   where there's infinite personalized content
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   created for you, and you just keep scrolling,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.500]   whether that's on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.500]   or what have you.
[00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.500]   And that's where we spend a lot of our time now.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   And if you think about the transition,
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.500]   you're getting more for less,
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   meaning you're getting more content,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   you're getting more output with less input.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500]   The challenge with the chat interface
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.500]   is that you're getting almost today,
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   in its current iteration, a little bit less output
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   because it's mostly textual,
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500]   and it's requiring more input.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   You're having to write sentences and ask it stuff.
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.500]   And so I think if you think about the evolution
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.500]   of user interfaces in computing,
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   chat as an interface faces quite a bit of friction.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   The output of it, however, is so compelling
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   in certain use cases, as Chamath points out,
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   that there's certainly going to be places
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.500]   where it's absolutely going to replace the current modality.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   And then the backend of it can do incredible things
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   that no other computing interface can do,
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   but it needs to have kind of a revision
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   or rebuild on the front end for it to really work.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   That's my point of view and how I think about
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   kind of the long trajectory
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.500]   of where we've all been trained mentally
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   with respect to computing interfaces
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   and how this might kind of be challenged.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   - I think that's the key,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   how four older guys have been trained.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.500]   Watch how kids interact with their phones.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   First, they're never on a computer.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   They're always on their phones
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500]   and they're always talking to their phones
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   and it's always chat-based.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   And so I think we have a whole new generation
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   that like it's so native to the way
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   that they interact with the world.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   And to be honest, I was sitting there this morning
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   prepping for the pod
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.500]   and I had a brilliant conversation with ChatGPT
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.500]   about what happened with rates and inflation, et cetera,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   in 2000, 2001, 2002, it was interactive.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   I was using my voice, I wasn't typing anything.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   I thought it was terrific,
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.500]   way better than the experience I would have on Google.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   So again, I think we're early in the evolution of this,
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.500]   but I think that for my kids, this is completely native.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.500]   - Yeah, I mean, I think for kids, it's amazing.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.500]   I just don't think kids will have 20, 30, 40 bucks a month
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   to spend on this.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]   I mean, some kids will,
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   but that'll just further exacerbate the divide
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   of the kids that can versus the kids that can't.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   But I don't think that that's what's gonna create
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   a valuation framework for a multi-decabillion dollar company.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   If you wanna see a well-used education product,
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   you know, Chegg's got something probably,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   you know, that's probably as good,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   and that's a three or $4 billion market cap company
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   last time I checked.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500]   - Yeah, well, Brad, you mentioned
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.500]   that you were doing a little research for the pod
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   talking about rates.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   Obviously, that was in anticipation of the discussion
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.500]   on the Federal Reserve meeting minutes
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   that came out a couple days ago.
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.500]   I'll read a few excerpts from the published minutes
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.500]   where obviously the Federal Reserve meets
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   to discuss overnight rates, whether to raise rates
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   and their outlook for rates,
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   driven in part by current economic data,
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   including their view on inflation,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   their view on economic activity, et cetera.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   Reading from the notes directly,
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.500]   participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   and noted that the data, including the CPI for May,
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500]   indicated that declines in inflation
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.500]   had been slower than they had expected.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.500]   Participants observed that although core goods inflation
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   had moderated since the middle of last year,
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.500]   it had slowed less rapidly than expected in recent months,
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   despite data and reports from business contacts
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500]   indicating that supply chain constraints
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   had continued to ease.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500]   In their discussion on the household sector,
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   they noted that consumer spending so far this year
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.500]   has been stronger than expected
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.500]   and that aggregate household wealth remained high
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.500]   as equity and home prices had not declined much
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   from the recent highs.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.500]   And a few participants mentioned that while overall
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   the household sector still retained
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   much of the excess savings
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500]   it had accumulated during the pandemic,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.500]   there were signs that consumers were facing
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.500]   increasingly tighter budgets given high inflation,
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.500]   especially for low-income households, despite savings.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.500]   So Brad, maybe you can give us your quick read on the minutes.
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   And they did say that they're not raising rates,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   but they do expect two more 25 basis point rate hikes
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.500]   later this year.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   Maybe you can tell us what market data
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   is indicating, is that actually the case?
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   And is the Fed not giving a clean reading
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.500]   on economic activity and inflation
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.500]   as it's being published in other places
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   than what the Fed is currently reading?
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.500]   - Well, I mean, I think the most interesting thing here,
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.500]   and perhaps the most non-consensus thing here,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   is the Fed kind of seems to be orchestrating
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   a pretty soft landing, right?
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.500]   Nobody wants to hear it.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   The market fought it for the first half of the year.
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.500]   The NASDAQ was just up 39% in the first half,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.500]   and most people didn't participate.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   So everybody wants to talk this down
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   and say that inflation's still out of control.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.500]   Chamath's been talking about inflation higher for longer,
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   but notice he doesn't say that's a problem
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.500]   or the economy therefore is going to crash.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   It's just like inflation's going to be a little stickier
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   on the way down.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.500]   Rates are gonna be a little bit higher for longer.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.500]   I think when you look at this in totality,
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.500]   the reason they hit pause
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   is because they've come a long way quickly.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.500]   They know that things are starting to trend
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   in the right direction.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   So their own forecast for CPI
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   is that it comes down a lot by the end of the year.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   Goldman Sachs is now at 3.3%.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   And I know we have readings like true inflation
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   that say the inflation today is actually lower than that,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   but you don't even need to get to the debate
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   between true inflation and CPI.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   They're both trending a lot lower.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   But we got a really interesting reading this morning
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   because like, why do we want to raise rates?
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500]   Well, we want to cool off the economy.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   And so everybody's looking for that indication
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   that the economy is cooling.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.500]   The leading indicator for this is jobs.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   So we had a really hot ADP jobs report this morning, right?
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   Over 450,000 new jobs created
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.500]   and everybody got nervous.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   The 10-year shot up to over 4%.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   The market turned down at the start of the day.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.500]   And then we got the JOLTS report.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   Now, Larry Summers has described JOLTS
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   as a much more, that's job openings, okay?
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.500]   So this is more of a leading indicator,
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.500]   like how many of the job openings are we consuming?
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.500]   And that actually came in better than expected.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   So what it suggested is that more people took jobs
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.500]   than we had anticipated.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   And remember, JOLTS peaked closer to 12 million
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   and now we're at about 9.8 million.
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.500]   And so when I look at that, you know,
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   and then look at the jobs report, ADP jobs report,
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   over half of the new jobs created
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.500]   were in hospitality and leisure.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   So think about what was happening a year ago.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.500]   Airlines were trying to hire people.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   Restaurants were trying to hire people.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   Hotels were trying to hire people.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500]   And nobody took the job for two reasons.
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   Number one, they were afraid of COVID.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   But number two, they were getting STEMI checks
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500]   from the government they didn't need to work.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   Now what we see is people are starting to take jobs.
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.500]   Those show up as higher employment numbers in ADP,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   but in lower JOLTS, right?
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   So fewer job openings.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   To me, again, that probably speaks to a, you know,
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   healthy trend in the economy.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   But clearly the economy is not crashing.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   We had a lot of people who said that the economy
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.500]   was going to hit the skids in Q1 or Q2 of this year
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   due to these higher rates.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   The economy is incredibly resilient.
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   But if I had to describe, you know, the rate trajectory,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   the Fed has said, "Listen, we may have two more rate hikes."
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.500]   That's basically priced in.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.500]   And if you look at real rates,
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.500]   so this is the interest rate that really acts
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   as the brake on the economy.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   So this is effectively the 10-year
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.500]   versus future expected inflation.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   It's now at one of the highest levels we've had
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   since 2008, 2009, back closing in on 2%.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   So, you know, it seems to me that the Fed's got its foot
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   pretty strong on the brake.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   It's jawboning the economy,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   saying we'll do more if we have to.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   But the things that they're looking at,
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   job openings are coming down, inflation is coming down.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   So I don't know.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.500]   I think you have to leave open the possibility
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   that the fat part of the distribution curve
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   looks like a softer landing than most people want to admit.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   Yeah, so, Chamath,
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.500]   Gerstner's predicting a soft landing.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   Do you agree?
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   I mean, you've said we're going to see rates stay high
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   for a very long period of time.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   Yeah, I mean, I think I've said this
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.500]   for the last few weeks, so I'll just say it again.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   But I think that there's no hard landing, right?
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   That's the hard landing was sort of the Druckenmiller thing
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   that I think that, you know, I said,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.500]   I think it was a few weeks ago.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.500]   It's very difficult to see a hard landing
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   when China stimulates just because of their natural
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   gravitational pull in the world economy.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.500]   And, you know, we can talk about that again
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.500]   because it just looks like China's in super, super,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   super trouble.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   Meanwhile, I sent this little image to you,
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   and, Freeberg, you may just want to throw it up here
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.500]   just to look at it.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   But, you know, when you look at inflation,
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   we've done the best job of the developed nations
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   in getting this thing under control.
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   And so I think now it's just about making sure
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   that we adequately contract the money supply
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.500]   and making sure that we have bullets in the chamber
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.500]   in case things get bad.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   What do I mean?
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   When you look at this chart,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   the thing that I think about is I'm glad rates
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   are almost at 6%.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   Why?
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.500]   Because when you look at the UK, Italy, Germany,
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   most of the euro area, France, Japan,
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   and then, you know, China, it's nonexistent,
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.500]   but China has a different issue.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   The reality is that, you know,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   a pretty bad set of economic circumstances
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.500]   could actually touch the Western developed nations
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   if you start to see some of these countries
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   rip rates higher to like 7%, 8%, 9%.
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   The UK, it seems like, I don't know what you guys think,
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   it's definitely going to 7%.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   And it could go to 8%.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   I mean, it could be a very bad situation for the UK.
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   They're in a lot of trouble.
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   And so I think it's important that the Federal Reserve
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500]   have tools.
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   So by continuing to constrict the money supply,
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   have rates that are relatively elevated,
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   maybe a quarter or two longer than they need to,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   it gives them a lot of positive optionality
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   if they need to step in if something bad really happens.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   And so I generally think they've done a very good job.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   And I think, go ahead.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500]   - Chamath, not to interrupt, to your point,
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   what's really interesting is the symmetry
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.500]   with what happened in 2000.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   So I think we had all agreed that the last time
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   we saw the zaniness that we saw in 2021
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.500]   in the ZURP environment was probably like 1999, 2000 era.
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.500]   Well, in 2000, remember, we had this huge asset bubble
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   and the Fed raised rates from 5.5% to 6% in 2000, okay,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.500]   in the first half of 2000.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   And they were saying that they're going to stay high for long.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   And remember, in 2001, we entered a recession
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   and we ended 2001 with rates all the way down at 1.75%.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.500]   Those are the bullets in the chamber
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   that you're talking about.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.500]   That then pulled us out of the recession.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.500]   And some people blame them that they caused that recession.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.500]   But when you look back from a historical perspective--
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.500]   - No, in this case, it looks like the recession
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   is really not of our making.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.500]   But we may actually have a soft landing,
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   but the economy could actually contract
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   because when you look at these Western economies turning over,
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   it's not a good situation.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   I think the Eurozone, quite honestly,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   is probably a quarter into a recession already.
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   So we have six or seven of the really important countries
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   probably in a recession, the UK in really big trouble,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   the US relatively keeping things in a pretty good place,
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   China economically, I don't know where the demand
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.500]   is going to come from.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.500]   On the same time that their internal demand is imploding,
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   they're creating all these export controls
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   that I think are not going to actually help them
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   solve the problem because it just accelerates
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.500]   Western economies' desire to delever from China.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   So the whole setup, I think, is a very complicated one,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   but the US looks really good, frankly.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.500]   - Yeah, look, I don't think we're out of the woods quite yet.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.500]   So Druckenmiller, by the way, said that he was predicting
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.500]   a hard landing in the second half of the year.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.500]   We're just starting the second half of the year.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.500]   So he's still got six months to be proven correct.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.500]   I find his analysis compelling,
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   or I did at the time I heard it.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.500]   But think about our situation.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   We still have an inverted yield curve.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.500]   It's the most inverted it's been.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.500]   I think this is the longest it's been inverted.
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.500]   Now the Fed is signaling that we're going to get
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   two or three more quarter-point rate hikes,
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   so it's about to become even more inverted.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.500]   And what that does is it puts incredible pressure
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   on the banking system because the whole banking
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.500]   business model is to borrow short,
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   which is from depositors, and lend long.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   And if short rates are higher than long rates,
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.500]   that whole business model doesn't work.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   So either they can't engage in lending activities,
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.500]   meaning there's a credit crunch,
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.500]   or depositors leave the system, and that's happening too.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   So any business out there that's dependent on credit,
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   the real estate industry or auto industry,
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   I mean, any industry that depends on loans and credit,
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   they're going to continue to be hammered by this.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   - Yeah, I mean, to your point, Sax,
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   I'll just read the minute commentary on this.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.500]   The meeting did include a discussion on the stress
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   on the banking sector and economic activity in general
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.500]   because of decreased lending.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   Participants generally noted that banking stresses
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   had receded and conditions in the banking sector
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.500]   were much improved since March.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   Participants generally continue to judge that a tightening
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.500]   in credit conditions spurred by banking sector stress
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   earlier in the year would likely weigh further
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.500]   on economic activity, but the extent remained uncertain.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.500]   So obviously a wait and see.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   And that they mentioned that credit conditions
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   had not appeared to have tightened significantly
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   beyond what would be expected in response
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.500]   to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.500]   So at this point, saying it's a wait and see
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.500]   does not seem to have overstretched
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   in terms of credit tightening at this stage.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   - Well, yeah, I mean, so here's the thing,
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   is that the Fed engaged in an extraordinary intervention
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   a few months ago to save the banking system
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.500]   with the bank term funding program, right?
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.500]   Where they basically said to all the banks
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.500]   that if you have US treasuries,
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.500]   and I think it also applied to mortgage-backed securities
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   as well, we will basically take all of those assets
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.500]   and give you par value.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   We'll give you 100 cents on the dollar
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:03.500]   in exchange for, I guess you have to pay,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   you the bank would have to pay the one year,
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   I think it was the 12-month interest rate
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.500]   with like 10 basic points or something like that.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   So if you're sitting on bonds that have gone down
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.500]   20 or 30% in value, you can go get all that money back
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   by presenting them to the Fed.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   And then you just have to, you have to then take
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   the 100 cents on the dollar that you get
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   and make sure you loan it out at higher than
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.500]   the one year interest rate, which is around, I guess, 5%.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   Which you can still do in residential, right?
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.500]   Because mortgages are still something like,
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.500]   they're over 7%.
[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   So the Fed has provided a lot of liquidity
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   to the banks through this BTFP.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   It hasn't helped the commercial real estate guys,
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.500]   I don't think, that's why they're still,
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   I think, huge problems in the commercial real estate sector.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   But the Fed did engage in a huge intervention
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.500]   to save the banking system,
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.500]   and they may not be done with that yet.
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   So I just wonder, you know, I just wonder
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   if you didn't have all of these distortions,
[00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500]   what would the real shape of the economy be?
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   You know, another one on the fiscal side,
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   on the fiscal side was the whole Biden's energy bill,
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   which was supposed to be 350 billion.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   But as our energy investor friends are saying,
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   it's probably gonna be more like a trillion
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   when they add it all up.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   - No, but that's honestly, hold on.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   Those guys are being hyperbolic,
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   and they're just stupid and wrong.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   'Cause I know which friends they are,
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.500]   and I know them to be mostly stupid
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   and mostly wrong most of the time.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.500]   Look, the good thing to know about-
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.500]   - Oh my God, I'm gonna get a text after this.
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   - Well, yeah, you should,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.500]   because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about,
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.500]   and he keeps saying it.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.500]   - But there's a lot of stimulus is the point,
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   whether it's half a billion,
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   sorry, half a trillion or a trillion.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   - Whatever, he's just talking his book.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   But where, can I just go back
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.500]   to where you're fundamentally right,
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   and where I think both of us can be in unison on this,
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.500]   which is there is a looming credit crisis
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.500]   in the United States.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   And we've talked about this before.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   I tweeted something a few weeks ago,
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   but the debt wall that corporate America is about to hit
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.500]   is pretty meaningful.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   And to your point, David,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   a lot of these companies will have to thread a needle
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.500]   because if rates don't go down materially
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500]   in the next 18 to 24 months,
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   these folks are gonna be paying rates
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.500]   that they cannot bear.
[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:34.500]   And they'll probably go into still breach a covenant
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.500]   of some of the debt.
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.500]   So, one thing that's important here
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   is that there's some very strict guidelines and covenants
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   that debt issuers sign up for.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   And one of them is,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   how much debt can I have as a percentage
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.500]   and or as a multiple of my EBITDA?
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   And so that's the way that bondholders govern the risk
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.500]   that you don't overborrow.
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   Now, the problem is if you have a ratings,
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   an earnings recession and or rates go up,
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.500]   you can get one of these two things to go wrong
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   and all of a sudden now you have seven or eight times
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.500]   your EBITDA and you're in a very, very bad state.
[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   So, I do think that that's possible.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.500]   But at the same time,
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   I don't think that that's a calamity
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.500]   that touches the entire economy.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500]   I think there are a whole portfolio
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.500]   of overleveraged companies in real estate
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.500]   and there's a whole portfolio
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.500]   of overleveraged companies in private equity.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.500]   Those folks will have to get recapped.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   And that will probably cost trillions of dollars
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   of capital impairment.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.500]   But I do think that that can relatively be done
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   without impairing the economy at large.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.500]   I'll make a prediction right now.
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   My prediction is the federal government
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.500]   is going to help to monetize that debt
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.500]   and they're going to help to support
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.500]   that commercial real estate sector
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.500]   through some sort of structured lending program.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   I don't see how...
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.500]   Why do you think that?
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.500]   Because of the donors.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   Because I think that there's a significant amount
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.500]   of capital that gets donated to political campaigns.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.500]   So, you think there's going to be a TARP-like program?
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   For real estate private equity.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.500]   A real estate private equity in debt.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   You think there's going to be a TARP-like program
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.500]   for real estate assets and for private...
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   I'll take the other side of that.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.500]   Yeah, I'll say real estate assets.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500]   I don't know about the private equity assets,
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   but I think for the real estate assets,
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.500]   just because so much of it is held...
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.500]   Let's bet 5,000 to the SPCA.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.500]   Yeah, I'll do that.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   Wait, what's the time frame?
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.500]   Maybe...
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.500]   Why don't you tell me?
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.500]   You want infinite?
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   No, we'll do it until the Fed starts...
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.500]   No, until the Fed starts reducing rates.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:24.500]   So, once the Fed does their first rate cut,
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   that's the end of our bet.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.500]   Oh, wow, that's an easy one.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   I'm in for 25.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   No, you can take 5.
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.500]   I'd take 100.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.500]   Okay.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   For the SPCA.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   Can I take it for myself?
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.500]   For the SPCA.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   For the SPCA for a second.
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.500]   Can I just take the action for myself?
[00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.500]   No, come on.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.500]   I'm doing it for the dogs.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:40.500]   I'm doing it for the dogs.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.500]   You know, Friedberg on that...
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.500]   I'm sorry, let me just tell you why.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.500]   Sorry.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   Okay, okay.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   In addition to the significant donor dollars
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   that come from real estate to politicians, campaigns.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.500]   But so many of those assets are held
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.500]   in life insurance companies, on banks' balance sheets.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   I mean, you guys may have seen this report this week
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   that because of the rise in interest rates,
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   there are several insurance companies
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   that now may be technically insolvent,
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.500]   according to DOI, Department of Insurance regs,
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500]   in their respective states.
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.500]   Because the impairment on the bond portfolio has declined,
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   has caused them to now not have enough capital reserves
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   to pay out the claims they have.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   So the same, I think, ultimately will come true
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   once you have to do a mark to market
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.500]   on all these real estate assets,
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   that there's a significant number of those real estate assets
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.500]   that are held in pension funds,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   that are held in life insurance companies,
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   that are held as securities in large pools of capital
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   that are meant to support people's long-term needs.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500]   And the government isn't going to let...
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.500]   The federal government isn't going to let that,
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   you know, just get written down
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   and have people's future pensions or insurance claims,
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   you know, get hampered.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.500]   So that's why I think there's going to be a moment or two
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   where there's going to be some step in
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   and some structured program to support this debt.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   - I just don't think it's that draconian.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   Rates are not that high.
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.500]   You know, we're still talking about a 10-year
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:01.500]   that's flirting with 4%.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   And the fact of the matter is...
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.500]   - I'm just talking about commercial real estate,
[00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   'cause there's also a demand problem, right? Yeah.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:11.500]   - I know, but the other side of this is the trend, again,
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   there is no doubt oversupply and a problem,
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   particularly in a place like San Francisco,
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.500]   where we're going to see some blowups
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   because nobody wants to, you know,
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.500]   to enter a long-term lease in a city that's under siege.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500]   I understand that.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   But the fact is that the market is telling you
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.500]   that rates are going to start going down, right?
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:36.500]   The Fed's going to come in, battle until the edge, right?
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   And then they're going, you know,
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.500]   rates are going to come down a little bit.
[00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.500]   Why is that?
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.500]   Because if they have two more quarter point rate increases,
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   now you have restrictive rates.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.500]   That's something like 200 basis points.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   That's higher than the Fed wants.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.500]   That's the foot really hard on the brake.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.500]   So it's not like the market's crazy
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.500]   and thinking that we're going to have
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.500]   a couple of rate cuts next year.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   I just told you, in 2000, we went from 6% to 2001,
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   ending the year at 1.75%.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.500]   And the Fed was doing the exact same jawboning
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   in the summer of 2000, okay?
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   So they do evolve rate policy
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.500]   based upon what's happening in the economy.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.500]   All of the things are rolling over.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.500]   CPI is rolling over, JOLTS is rolling over, et cetera.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.500]   So again, I just don't see the heightened concern.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   I think to the bank issue, Sax,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.500]   to me, that was, you know,
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.500]   that was the much scarier concern.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.500]   Druckenmiller actually pulled forward
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:35.500]   his hard landing expectation to Q2 of this year
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.500]   as a result of the bank crisis
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   and now has pushed it back out to Q4 of this year.
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   I think if we had another, you know,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.500]   black swan like banks or something
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.500]   that I can't foresee today,
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.500]   then, you know, that could certainly be the thing
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.500]   that would be the catalyst
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   to toss us into a hard landing.
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   Barring that, I think that--
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.500]   By the way, you know, you would have said--
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.500]   I think the distribution of probabilities,
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.500]   the fat part of the curve,
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   is that we have a softish, medium,
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   you know, sort of landing here.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:04.500]   I think you're right. I think you're right.
[00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   And by the way, like, if the UK
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   had not left Europe,
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   then the whole contagion of Europe
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:17.500]   could be one of those black swan events
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   that we would all be talking about
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.500]   as theoretically possible.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.500]   But it looks like the UK
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.500]   is probably going to--
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.500]   It's really bad, I think.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.500]   Britain is now the only major economy
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.500]   where inflation is still rising.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   The OECD said Tuesday that year-on-year inflation
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:37.500]   in the G7 fell to 4.6% in May,
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.500]   down from, you know, 5% in April.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   So inflation is tempering a bit.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:47.500]   But UK consumer prices rose to 7.9% in May,
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.500]   which is up from 7.8% in April.
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.500]   So an acceleration in the UK.
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.500]   It seems like it's a pretty nasty spiral problem.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.500]   This is where, you know, the benefit
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   of being part of a larger economy
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.500]   really pays dividends, right?
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   Obviously, there's a lot to do with, you know,
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   language and currency,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.500]   and there's a whole bunch of issues rolled up
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.500]   into why the UK left the European Union.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.500]   But, my gosh, one of the real obvious advantages is,
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.500]   you know, you're smoothing out the variance, right?
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:19.500]   And smoothing out variance is really valuable.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   So if you think about, like,
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.500]   all of these economies in Europe,
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.500]   you know, like, PMs in a hedge fund, right?
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.500]   Brad, you can--you know, you know this.
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.500]   It's like, sometimes some guy crushes it.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.500]   You know, look how Millennium or SAC
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.500]   or Citadel makes the real money.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   It's by smoothing out variance,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.500]   and that's a great thing about being part
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.500]   of an economic union like the EU offers.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.500]   And in the absence of that, in times like this,
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.500]   it really exposes the weaknesses
[00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.500]   of a small, subscale economic system,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   which, unfortunately, the UK has.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   - Right.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.500]   - Europe is going into a recession, too.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.500]   I mean, Germany has huge problems.
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.500]   Again, it stems from the cutoff of cheap Russian gas.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.500]   Economies in the EU, they're going into recession as well.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   So it's not just the UK.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.500]   - Yes, but not with the same levels of inflation.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.500]   My point is, like, you know,
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.500]   it's one thing for an economy to start to recede,
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   but here, it's--you don't have the benefit
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.500]   of balance sheet borrowing of the scale of the EU,
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.500]   nor do you have the disinflation of the EU,
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   and I think that's problematic,
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   much more for the UK than it is
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.500]   for any individual country in Europe.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.500]   That's just my point. That's all.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.500]   - Can I--you know, one just philosophical thought,
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.500]   you know, because if we rewind the clock
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.500]   to the beginning of the year,
[00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:42.500]   you know, there was absolute consensus in the markets,
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.500]   right, and you can go back and look at all the headlines.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.500]   Mike Wilson's consensus was that we were gonna have
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.500]   a hard landing in Q1.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.500]   Hedge funds, long-only funds,
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.500]   had their exposure super low.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.500]   Everybody had post-traumatic stress from last year.
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   It is a sure strategy to lose a lot of money
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.500]   or not make money.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.500]   If you're trying to always call the market
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.500]   as though you know, you have no idea, right?
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.500]   Q1 and Q2, sure, there was a possibility
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.500]   we could have a hard landing, right?
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.500]   And the bank crisis made that look
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:16.500]   as though it was a possibility.
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   What we try to do is look at that distribution
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.500]   of possibilities, right?
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   It's a distribution curve,
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.500]   and so I put up on the screen here
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:30.500]   what the market's implied Fed fund rate changes are
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.500]   from today.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.500]   So what the market is betting on,
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.500]   which from my perspective is better than any one of us
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.500]   trying to forecast, right,
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.500]   what's gonna happen with future rate increases,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.500]   it's saying, yeah, we're going to go
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   from 5.08% today to something like peaking
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.500]   at 5.45% in November of this year.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:52.500]   And then at some point beyond November,
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.500]   could be December, could be Q1 of next year, right?
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   We'll see enough turning over of CPI,
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   enough turning over of jolts
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.500]   that now we'll say the balance of risk
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.500]   has shifted to being too punitive on the economy.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.500]   So we're gonna reel back in one of those rate increases, okay?
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.500]   And I think that, you know, so Friedberg,
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.500]   just to clarify on the bet we just made,
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.500]   which I'm excited about,
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.500]   you have to have this TARP, you know,
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.500]   commercial real estate rescue program
[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.500]   before they reel back one of those rate increases,
[00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   which the market's telling you could be as early as December.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   But I encourage everybody who listens,
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   you know, like don't listen, you know,
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.500]   it's not like go all in because Druckenmiller says hard landing
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   or don't go all in soft landing because we say soft landing.
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.500]   Our net exposure has come down
[00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   over the course of the year at altimeter
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.500]   because we've moved, the markets have moved up a lot.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   They're pricing in more of a soft landing today.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:51.500]   So the idea is to have high exposures
[00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.500]   when the world's panicked
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.500]   and then to reel in your exposures a little bit,
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.500]   but never be all or none.
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.500]   I mean, the fascination with calling the big short,
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.500]   the big hard landing, soft landing,
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   it's just a sure way not to make much money.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   Today, there was a red hot U.S. jobs report, Brad.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   U.S. job openings dropped below 10 million in May,
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.500]   but the labor market remains piping hot.
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.500]   Like I said, you know, the market, I think,
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.500]   is, you know, it's reading way too much.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.500]   I mean, it's wasn't even a, I mean,
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   we'll get the official jobs numbers
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   out of the federal government tomorrow.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   This was an ADP report,
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.500]   which have been not particularly good,
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   but I already explained there's a rationale.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.500]   Look, peel behind the ADP report.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   250,000 of the 400,000 odd jobs that were created
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.500]   were in hospitality and leisure.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   I mean, these were desperately needed
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   because we have a peak summer travel season going on.
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.500]   So you have hotels that hire a bunch of people.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   Those show up in the ADP job numbers, right?
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   But the great news is the Jolts job openings go down.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.500]   And, you know, Summers was complaining last year
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.500]   that Jolts wasn't going down fast enough.
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.500]   He also said something that was really interesting.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:13.500]   When Jolts, he said, when Jolts goes down by over 10%,
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.500]   so think, we've had a move from 12 million to 9.8 million.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.500]   He said, when Jolts goes down by over 10%,
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   we have a reduction or an increase in the unemployment rate
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   by 2.5% in the subsequent 12 months.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   So Jolts is a leading indicator.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   You got to reel in those job openings,
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   and then you start seeing unemployment bump up.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   So with a tight economy, you know,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   the Fed's foot on rates,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   some of the contraction that SAXE has been pointing out,
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   and then we start to see these early indicators in Jolts.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   People need the job, clearly, or they wouldn't have taken them.
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.500]   Their STEMI has run out.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.500]   All of these things are what the Fed is trying to manufacture.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.500]   So I don't look at that jobs number.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.500]   In fact, we were doing just the opposite, you know,
[00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.500]   in the market this morning to, you know,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   what the market was giving us.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   I don't think that was a very good read-through at all.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.500]   Okay, I want to talk a little bit about jobs.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.500]   The Florida State Senate bill 1718
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   was passed in the Senate on July 1st.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.500]   This bill now requires that any company
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   with more than 25 employees use the e-verify system
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   to verify the legal immigration status
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.500]   of their workers, of their employees.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:36.500]   And this will create a real impact on businesses
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   that employ more than 800,000 illegal immigrants
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.500]   in the state of Florida to do a lot of work and a lot of labor.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.500]   And it's unclear how many of those 800,000 illegal immigrants
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   that are working in Florida today
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.500]   are working at a firm with more than 25 employees.
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:56.500]   But the impact is going to range from the construction industry
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:02.500]   to farm labor and a lot of other manual labor sectors
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.500]   in a state that has 2.3% unemployment.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   DeSantis has made this, you know, an important speaking topic.
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.500]   When he's spoken publicly,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.500]   he's made a lot of comments around the passage of this bill
[00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:19.500]   as a way to counter Biden's "open immigration policy."
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.500]   Sax, I know that you've talked about DeSantis in the past.
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.500]   Do you have a read on the impact
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.500]   that this immigration policy will have?
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   Do you agree with it? Would love your thoughts.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.500]   I mean, I don't think this is a jobs bill.
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:37.500]   This is an immigration bill, or it's an immigration issue.
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.500]   And look, I don't know what the impact on Florida
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.500]   is going to be based on this.
[00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   I don't trust a single story that's out of--
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   I guess there's just a story in The Wall Street Journal about it.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.500]   I mean, this feels like a campaign story.
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.500]   So I want to see more stories before I reach a determination
[00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   on what the impact's going to be.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.500]   But politically, do I think this is smart?
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   Yeah, because the border is the number one issue
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.500]   in the country right now.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   I don't think you guys are as clued in
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.500]   to, like, how on fire the country is
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.500]   about what's going on at the border.
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.500]   At our fundraiser, RFK talked about the border
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.500]   because he went there.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   There's a bunch of really good clips online.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   I don't care who you are.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.500]   You can't listen to that accounting.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   It's just an accounting, right?
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   So anybody could do it.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   So it doesn't matter what your political perspective is on RFK.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.500]   Anybody who listens to that accounting
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.500]   can't be anything but shocked.
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   What he described is--
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   what RFK described is he went to the border at Yuma,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.500]   and there are literally holes in the wall,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   you know, from Trump's wall.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:49.500]   And literally, the building materials to finish the wall
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.500]   and plug those holes are sitting there on the ground,
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   and the Biden administration refuses to use them
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   and to plug the hole because they don't want to give any credit
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:00.500]   to Trump, presumably.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   I mean, literally, that's how petty it is.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.500]   Or it's actually their policy.
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.500]   They actually like having an open border.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.500]   So something like 7 million illegals have come in
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   through the southern border since Biden's been in office.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   And they're not from Central America, it turns out.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.500]   These folks are from Eastern Europe and Africa predominantly,
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.500]   many men of military age.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.500]   And it's an entire business that's run by the cartels.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   And as he describes it, it's really just plainly shocking.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:38.500]   If one of our enemies wanted to get thousands of sleeper agents
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.500]   into the country, it would have been very easy for them to do this.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.500]   Think about that for a second.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.500]   Yeah, can I pivot away from the border policy question
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.500]   to one of labor?
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   We obviously, as evidenced by the jobs report from ADP this morning,
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   remain in a very tight labor market in the U.S.
[00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   And we as a group often talk about H-1Bs and the importance
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.500]   of allowing educated immigrants into this country
[01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   to meet our knowledge workforce needs.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.500]   But there obviously is a pretty sizable manual labor workforce need
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.500]   in this country and a very tight labor market to fulfill that need,
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.500]   ranging from construction, where we have deep and significant
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.500]   aspirations as a country to improve infrastructure,
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.500]   to farm labor, where we have the largest agricultural export market
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500]   in the world.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   And many of these industries rely on low-cost labor
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.500]   for those businesses to meet their economic objective,
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   to be able to be profitable.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.500]   And we simply may not have enough of a labor force of legal immigrants
[01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   or legal citizens or residents of the U.S. to meet those obligations.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.500]   What is the answer, Sax?
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   Is it that we are supposed to take anyone that's illegal in the country
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.500]   and make it impossible for them to work here?
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   And is that not going to have a very adverse effect
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   on these important segments of our economy that today rely
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.500]   on that labor force that is here illegally?
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   And I'm not stating an opinion.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   I'm asking the important--
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   I get what you're saying.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   I think we can start to resolve that issue
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   when you solve the border crisis.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   The problem is the average American doesn't want to hear anything
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   about "comprehensive solutions" to the border crisis or immigration--
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   But what do you want?
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   I'm not talking about politics.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   I'm talking about your personal point of view.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:27.500]   My personal point of view is we need to seal the borders
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   so we stop having this problem.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.500]   Okay, but what about the work?
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.500]   What about the labor?
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   I'll take a crack at it for you, Bert.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.500]   Okay, I'm just trying to diagnose the difference
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:41.500]   between the border policy question and the real economic question.
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   I know the California ag sector very well.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.500]   There's an important migrant visa that the entire farming economy
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.500]   depends on in California.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:53.500]   And these are illegal immigrants that are legally allowed to work
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:56.500]   in the farming sector, and it allows farms to be able to do the work
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.500]   they need to do because there is absolutely no labor to do that work
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.500]   without this immigrant population.
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.500]   And there's other elements of this that are critical across the economy.
[01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500]   Sorry, Brad, go ahead.
[01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   So why can't we have a common-sense migrant worker program,
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.500]   worker visa, predicated on that?
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.500]   The problem is, I think, where most people are in agreement
[01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.500]   that if you have a relatively secure border,
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.500]   then you design good policies.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.500]   We should have a policy for people who want to come and work
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.500]   and earn some money.
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.500]   We have job openings in this country.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   And then return home or go through a normal process
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.500]   to get in line to citizenship.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.500]   But the problem is people cutting the line,
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.500]   skipping the system, and given the social safety nets
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   that states on the border have lined up,
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.500]   and we as a nation have lined up,
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.500]   that's just unsustainable in a world where we're already, whatever,
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500]   $35 trillion in debt.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   So I think these things can coexist.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.500]   You can treat labor humanely.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   You can create a safe harbor for labor to come to the country.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   But that doesn't mean that you should just have holes in the wall
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   and anybody who wants to come here can come here in whatever capacity they want.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   Chamath, assuming that the border is closed and we fix that problem,
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.500]   what do you think the right solution is to the millions of illegal immigrants
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   that are residing in this country?
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   I'll answer that, but let me ask you a question.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500]   Do you think we should seal the border?
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.500]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   And why do you think we should seal the border?
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   So that we have a system that we can use to manage the flow of labor
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   and decide what's appropriate for our country.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.500]   And we can actually have a conversation about what qualifies someone
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.500]   to come across the border and to immigrate into the U.S.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   I totally agree with you.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.500]   I agree.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   But look, saying that, assume that the border was sealed,
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   what would you do about low-skill immigration?
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   That's kind of like asking, other than that, how is the play Mrs. Lincoln?
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   I mean, this is the hair-on-fire political issue,
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.500]   is that we can't get the border sealed.
[01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:07.500]   That you've had 7 million-plus illegals come across it
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   during the Biden administration,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.500]   and the administration obviously doesn't have the will to do anything about it.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:19.500]   So you're kind of assuming away the central issue.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:22.500]   This is the issue, one of the main, main issues that got Trump elected in 2016,
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500]   was building the wall.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   No, but I think we're all saying this.
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500]   It hasn't gone away.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500]   We need to seal the border.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   We're all saying that, right?
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.500]   Does anybody think we shouldn't seal the border?
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.500]   No, I agree.
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.500]   But then why isn't the analysis on why that doesn't happen
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.500]   when everyone in the country agrees that should happen, or just about everybody?
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   But I do think that there's a low-skill labor market need
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.500]   that's not met in this country.
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   There isn't a public restaurant company
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:49.500]   that doesn't talk about the challenges that they're having with labor.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   They cannot fill the jobs that they need to fill.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   All right, if you want to talk about that issue,
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.500]   I want to flag a report that was presented to Congress,
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   and this is about 15 years old, it's back in 2007, by Heritage.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   But I don't think the numbers have changed much in the interim.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500]   In fact, they've probably gotten worse.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.500]   The point that this researcher made is that if you look at the cost
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.500]   of low-skill immigration, the average low-skill immigrant household
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   receives approximately $30,000 in direct benefits from the government.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:25.500]   By contrast, these households only pay about $10,000 in taxes.
[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.500]   So even though those low-skill immigrant households,
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.500]   let's assume that they're working and do contribute to the economy
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:39.500]   in the way that you're saying, there's still a $20,000 gap
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:44.500]   between what they contribute and what they receive from the government.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   And that is a big problem for the country.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.500]   My guess is that the counterargument would be that more than $20,000
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.500]   of economic benefit accrues to the businesses that employ that labor
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.500]   because they can now be profitable, they can now get the work done
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500]   that they need to do, they can grow their revenue,
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.500]   they can expand their footprint, they can service their customers,
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500]   all the things that otherwise they might not be able to do
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500]   without having access to that lower-cost labor force.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   I think that's a big assumption. I think that's a big assumption.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   One of the problems with the system that we have is that there's a lot
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:21.500]   of government benefits. And so if you want to have a more open
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.500]   immigration policy, that's sort of inconsistent with the idea
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500]   of having a super generous benefits policy.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500]   No, I think there are three distinct things.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   One is, is it open or closed? And second, if it's closed,
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   what are the qualification criteria and how many--
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.500]   and I think that's totally reasonable.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   The third is what government benefits are provided.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   And you could reduce the government benefits if it's too costly.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.500]   You could improve the qualification criteria and increase the number
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.500]   of folks that are coming in.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   I know this may sound crazy, but I think that tying together
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   immigration and jobs is the best way to ensure that nothing
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   actually happens on immigration.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.500]   And what I mean by that is that when you go to a restaurant,
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   for example, and the service has decayed because they can't get enough staff,
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   you don't walk out of that restaurant thinking, "Wow, we need
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500]   comprehensive immigration reform."
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:20.500]   You say, "Thumbs down on Yelp. I'm never going back here again."
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.500]   And so unfortunately, if it's service sector jobs in particular,
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   by the way, there is no closed loop way where you actually tie
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   these two issues together.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:36.500]   And so the issue becomes stranded, which is what it has,
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   which is why I think what Brad said and Sak said is right,
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   which is there's an order of operations here where the American people
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   probably want an immigration system that says something like,
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   "Here's a point-based approach where we try to attract the world's best.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.500]   Think about it like a draft, right?
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:00.500]   And we want to attract the world's best athletes to come play on our team,
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.500]   Team America, Team USA."
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.500]   We have all of the capabilities to do that, but before we do that,
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.500]   we have to kind of close the border.
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   And I think that that's the only way it's ever going to get done.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   Meanwhile, the problem with the jobs thing is it's a bit of a red herring
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.500]   towards immigration because people just don't tie the two things together,
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   practically speaking.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   Well, I was going to say one final point on this is that when you admit
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.500]   lots of low-skill immigration or labor into the country,
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:30.500]   you're creating wage pressure for Americans at the lowest end of the totem pole.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   And that is why they are so resistant to it.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   This is why average working-class Americans are very upset about the border.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   It's also a security issue, and there's drugs pouring across as well,
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.500]   the fentanyl crisis that we see.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   But it creates a lot of wage pressure for Americans who are at the lowest end
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   of the ladder.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.500]   I mean, what's wrong with just paying them a little bit more?
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.500]   So here's some statistics for you guys.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   The total population of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. peaked in 2007
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   and has declined slightly since.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.500]   California felt it first.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   From 2010 to 2018, the unauthorized immigrant population in the state
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   declined by 10% to 2.6 million, mostly impacting the farm economy.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.500]   So the state, California state reports that from 2010 to 2020,
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:22.500]   the average number of workers hired by California farms for crop production
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   declined to 150,000 from 170,000.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.500]   I talk with a lot of people in the farm economy, as you guys know,
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.500]   and this is an endemic problem in California agriculture,
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   is that the lack of a labor force that allows the farms to be profitable
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   is really impacting folks' ability to operate and to grow,
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   and that ultimately translates into consumer price and so on.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.500]   So there are huge consequences to having effectively an open border policy
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   that go beyond just farms or vineyards not being able to hire enough cheap labor.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500]   I mean, look at what's going on in France right now.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   You've basically got riots.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.500]   You've got a civil war going on.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   There's a large, unassimilated, poor immigrant population in that country.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   That's where open borders gets you.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   That's the end result.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   So there are huge consequences to allowing in huge numbers of low-skilled immigrants,
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.500]   especially illegal ones.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   I don't think there's a lot--this is where we get to.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   Last week we had the Canada H-1B announcement about their Techno-Matic visa program,
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   and I sent it to two members of Congress.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.500]   I sent a tweet that--
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.500]   Sorry, just recap for us what happened, Brett.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.500]   Okay, so in Canada last week the government announced an aggressive push
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   to recruit technology workers from around the world to Canada.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   So they made it easier for tech workers to get what they are calling a digital nomad visa,
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:57.500]   so you can now go and work in Canada if you have a job offer.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:03.500]   And then they also, in kind of a gangster move, said if you already have an H-1B visa
[01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.500]   in the United States and it's starting to run out, just bring you and your family to Canada
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   and work from here.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   So it was like we've been talking about.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   We need H-1B visa reform.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   We need to recruit the world's best and brightest in artificial intelligence, etc.,
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   to the United States.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   And they were doing it quite aggressively.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   Now the point is I sent that to two members of Congress, a Democrat member of the House,
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   a Republican member of the Senate, and I got back nearly identical answers from both of them.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   They said no chance that happens here, dead on arrival, because nothing's going to move
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   until we have a comprehensive immigration policy in this country.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   And then I said, well, why isn't that happening?
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500]   They said elections, right?
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   The problem is all four of us agree we should have sealed borders,
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   but at the same time immigration is what makes this country great.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500]   We want to treat people humanely.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.500]   We need migrant workers.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.500]   This is not that hard a problem to solve in this country, but there's not even a conversation.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   The farce that is Washington, D.C., on this topic is there's not even an honest conversation
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.500]   or attempt to get to a solution here.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:22.500]   So with a presidential election less than a year and a half away,
[01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.500]   we're just back to the same old tribal war that we've had before.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:32.500]   Now, I understand Saks' point is like, listen, nothing happens until we have closed borders,
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   and maybe sequentially that's what we have to do, but it doesn't stop there.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:42.500]   I think we all agree that what makes this country special is that we, you know,
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:47.500]   Fourth of July, you know, we throw open the doors and we welcome, you know,
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   folks from around the world to contribute to this great experiment.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.500]   Some of them are on a path to citizenship and some of them are not.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:59.500]   What doesn't sit right with anybody is breaking the rules and skipping the line.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.500]   I understand the desperation and the motivation of some people to do that,
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   but that is not ever going to be a system that works for the majority.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   So it sounds like the--
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500]   Why is that happening?
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.500]   The reason that's happening is--
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500]   Well, it's being used for leverage, right, Saks?
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.500]   Yes, yes, the way I interpret--
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   Listen, when you say that we can't do anything until we have comprehensive immigration reform--
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:26.500]   By the way, I heard future Democratic nominee Gavin Newsom say the same thing on Hannity.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.500]   What the party in power is doing is holding the country hostage
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   and saying that we're not going to close the border.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.500]   We're going to use the border as a bargaining chip
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.500]   until you give us the immigration package that we want.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500]   But that really shouldn't be allowed because, really,
[01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.500]   it's the obligation of the federal government to have a secure border.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   That's not something you trade.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500]   That's something that we should already have.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.500]   Well, it's what we pay for.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.500]   That's what we pay for.
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.500]   So when they talk about comprehensive immigration reform,
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.500]   that's basically what they're saying is we're not going to give you a secure border
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.500]   until you give us enough policies that we want.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.500]   Just to give you guys the--
[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:10.500]   And Freeberg and Saks are immigrants, but you guys got your citizenship through your parents.
[01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   I actually did the process myself as a TN visa holder who then went to an H-1B,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.500]   who then I think went to EB-1.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:27.500]   So I've had to go through this, and I've literally had to wait in line.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   And I can't describe to you the anxiety you have when you know your visa is running out.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   You're waiting for customs and integration to basically give you the meeting
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:46.500]   so that they can actually approve or tell you that your H-1B is approved or your EB-1 is approved.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.500]   And you go to this website.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.500]   It's arcane.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.500]   You refresh it every day.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   You do it for six months straight every day a few times a day.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.500]   You go into the forums where all these other immigrants are talking about how frustrated they are
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.500]   and how scared they are.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.500]   But we all stood in line.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:08.500]   And I think what people don't understand who think that the southern border should be totally open
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:14.500]   is the anxiety that those of us who actually played by the rules went through for months,
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.500]   and in some cases if you come from countries like India and China, years.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   Right.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:25.500]   By the way, what you're saying is exactly why the Hispanic population,
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.500]   the Hispanic citizens of the United States are increasingly voting Republican
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500]   because they have gone through the process.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:35.500]   They have suffered the rigmarole,
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   and they don't want to see an open border policy that isn't fair and doesn't feel right.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:46.500]   We're first-generation Americans, and I remember when my parents went through the process.
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.500]   I think my dad got a green card based on being a doctor before we came here,
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500]   and then after five years we became citizens.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500]   It seemed a lot more orderly back then, by the way.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   Totally.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500]   The process just seemed to work.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   I've seen all the statistics showing the insane percentage of Silicon Valley startups
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:04.500]   that had at least one immigrant co-founder.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:10.500]   It's something like 40% to 50% of unicorn companies in Silicon Valley
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:15.500]   have at least one co-founder who's first-generation American or an immigrant.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:20.500]   So I understand full well the benefits to the country and our economy
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:24.500]   by being able to have immigrants come to America,
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.500]   but generally speaking, those are high-skill immigrants,
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:32.500]   and we should be able to have that as a feature of our system without having an open border.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.500]   And the problem is all these things get conflated right now.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:39.500]   And I think what's happening is it shouldn't be so hard to get extensions to H-1Bs.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:43.500]   It is really crazy that we're giving Canada this opportunity
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.500]   and that we're potentially driving out really talented high-skill workers.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   But the problem right now is that the southern border is such a mess
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.500]   that the average American doesn't want to hear anything about H-1Bs or--
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500]   Any immigration.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:57.500]   They don't want to hear about any of it.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500]   They're just like, "Shut the whole thing down."
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.500]   I would encourage people to listen to that RFK clip where he describes--
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.500]   and he's one of the rare presidential candidates that has taken the time
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.500]   and gone down there, and he just describes it very plainly.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.500]   So irrespective of what you think of him, listen to it because it's pretty factual,
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500]   and it's very scary.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.500]   This seems to me to be of such significant strategic national interest,
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:29.500]   similar to the national debt, that there really should be a commission
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:34.500]   of centrist folks appointed by whatever president--
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   this president, the next president--
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:42.500]   that tries to craft something we can pass, break it down into two or three bills.
[01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:48.500]   But this is really undermining our ability to compete in the world,
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:50.500]   and we need to solve this problem.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:56.500]   I think we've been discussing this for as long as we've been in Silicon Valley,
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:01.500]   but certainly it's become an incredible problem in the age of AI, et cetera,
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   and having the tit-for-tat of what's going on, these news articles,
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:12.500]   shipping off illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard--
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   I happen to be on Martha's Vineyard right now.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:19.500]   I think they sent 49 folks here, Venezuelan,
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:23.500]   most of them Central American, and I'll tell you, this island is made better
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:28.500]   because it has a tremendous number of Portuguese and Central American workers
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.500]   who are active members of the community, go to the school here, et cetera.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:38.500]   So maybe that is part of the solution, Sax, that when we do have people
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:44.500]   who want to immigrate to this country, the burden is not just on the border states,
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.500]   but that folks have an opportunity to locate anywhere in the country.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   Well, yeah, and what happened with the Martha's Vineyard thing is--
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.500]   I have seen some articles like the New York Times has articles saying
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.500]   how wonderfully it's all worked out, but when it first happened,
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.500]   the people living in Martha's Vineyard were up in arms,
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.500]   and there were a bunch of angry press conferences,
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:09.500]   and they were almost hysterical that the census had sent them there.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.500]   But what that did is it exposed the hypocrisy because there's a lot of people
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.500]   in the country who are just fine with having an open border
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500]   when they don't think it affects them.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.500]   Totally.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.500]   But when it does affect them, then all of a sudden
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.500]   they're holding press conferences denouncing it.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.500]   Tid for tat never works. Tid for tat never works.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.500]   You can have me at tid. You don't need the tat.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   Well, can we-- Speaking of--
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   By the way, sorry, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.500]   Lightening round. Who left the cocaine in the White House?
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.500]   What's the answer, Chema?
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:39.500]   I actually don't think it was Hunter Biden.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:43.500]   It was probably some young kid who was working long hours
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.500]   and was like, "I need a little upper here to stay up,"
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.500]   and was like, "I need a bump," and so the kid brought some nose candy.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   I mean, how stupid is this kid?
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.500]   And by the way, they said that there's no security footage.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.500]   It was in a cubby. It was in a cubby.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.500]   He put it in the cubby, whoever did it, which is so stupid.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500]   Why would you take it off your person?
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.500]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.500]   Well, speaking of--
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.500]   Clearly a conservative reporter who snuck in there to frame Hunter.
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:14.500]   And by the way, it was in the cubby where you're supposed to put your cell phone
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.500]   when you go into classified meetings.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.500]   Sax, have you been to the White House lately?
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500]   No.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.500]   Have any of you guys been in the Oval Office?
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:27.500]   I have, yeah. I'll tell you a very funny story about my meeting in the--
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.500]   It was in the Roosevelt Room where I had a funny meeting
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:34.500]   where it was me, Andreessen--
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.500]   Me, Andreessen-- I can't remember who else it was.
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.500]   This was years ago, a decade ago.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500]   This was during Obama's administration.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:45.500]   And something-- We were meeting with--
[01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.500]   I don't know, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:50.500]   and all these big muckety-mucks.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:53.500]   And I remember the military guys because there was four of them.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:55.500]   And at the time, there was like--
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:59.500]   Oh, my God, no, this was right when the first Ukraine thing was going on.
[01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:02.500]   Okay, so what was that, Sax? 2014, maybe?
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500]   2013, 2014?
[01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.500]   The first Ukraine thing, which--
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.500]   Anyways--
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.500]   Oh, yeah, 2014, yeah.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   2014, okay.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:15.500]   So we're there, and we're talking about new technologies, whatever.
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.500]   And I said, "Guys, I mean, this is insane.
[01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:23.500]   Why are you guys not dropping small sats
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.500]   so that you can get internet service into places like the Ukraine
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.500]   so that people can get the message out, whatever's happening?"
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   And I said, "These things are really small.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.500]   You can bring them anywhere."
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.500]   And I said, "I could have smuggled one in here right now."
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   One of the guys says, "No, we've been watching you since you got here."
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.500]   Oh, wow.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.500]   It was so very funny.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.500]   I thought it was hilarious.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.500]   Well, speaking of political farces--
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:54.500]   Here we go. Red meat.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.500]   No, it's not red meat.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.500]   I want to just do a quick recap on the whole Chinese spy balloon thing.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.500]   I actually think there's a serious statement here
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.500]   about how our political system works.
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.500]   But do you want to tee this up, Freeburger?
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.500]   No, go for it. Yeah, lead in. Yeah, go for it.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   All right, so basically you guys remember a few months ago
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.500]   that we had this whole Chinese spy balloon thing that went on for a week.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:21.500]   We had 24/7 wall-to-wall cable news coverage of this thing,
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:27.500]   and the administration was accused of being soft on China
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:31.500]   and allowing the spy balloon to traverse across the United States,
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.500]   and people were posting photos and videos of it online.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.500]   People were trying to shoot it down.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:40.500]   Yeah, then finally the White House deployed some F-16s
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.500]   to shoot down some $16 hobbyist balloons
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.500]   with $400,000 Sidewinder missiles to show that they were really tough.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500]   Anyway, it was this whole farce.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.500]   It turns out that the Pentagon just released a statement.
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:55.500]   So Pentagon Press Secretary Brigadier General Pat Ryder said
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.500]   the balloon not only did not transmit data back to China,
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.500]   it never collected any.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.500]   And he said, "We're aware that it had intelligence collection capabilities,
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.500]   but it has been our assessment now that it did not collect
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:13.500]   while it was transiting the United States."
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:18.500]   So if it wasn't collecting any data, it wasn't transmitting back to China,
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   and then I've also heard that it didn't contain any special equipment at all.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.500]   I've read articles saying that it was just standard equipment that you could buy.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.500]   How is it still a spy balloon?
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:33.500]   Everybody got worked up about this thing that turned out to be--
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.500]   But is it Chinese? Was it actually Chinese?
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   I think it was Chinese, but--
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.500]   With American technology.
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.500]   So now all the reporting--
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.500]   --is standard off-the-shelf equipment.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.500]   Yeah, now all the reporting is covering the fact that it had,
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.500]   quote, "American technology" on it.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.500]   Like, Sachs' point is you could just buy this stuff off the shelf.
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:53.500]   And if you guys remember around the time that it was discovered,
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:57.500]   we talked about this, but it wasn't widely covered in the media
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.500]   that there was an upgrade to the domestic radar system
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:06.500]   where they increased the resolution and the frequency of capture of these radar images.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.500]   So they were starting to pick up more fine-tuned, smaller objects
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:13.500]   that were otherwise being missed, including things like little weather balloons
[01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:17.500]   or stuff that otherwise wasn't getting paid attention to.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.500]   And that this balloon may have been the sort of thing that could have been a blip
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.500]   and ignored in the prior system, but then when they upgraded the system,
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:25.500]   it became a thing.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:28.500]   And to Sachs' point, what's interesting is how it got spun
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.500]   into a domestic threat by the Chinese.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.500]   Well, we had this debate on the pod months ago where I was like,
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.500]   "Look, this cannot be true. It makes no sense."
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:42.500]   I mean, the Chinese have spy satellites.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:46.500]   So if they wanted to spy on us, they would just use imaging from space.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:51.500]   So then people started speculating, "Well, this spy balloon must have
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.500]   new kinds of equipment, new sensors or sound maybe."
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:59.500]   They're trying to collect sound patterns, make recordings.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.500]   So in other words--
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.500]   Over farmland, over northern Canada and then farmland.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:07.500]   And yeah, like there's a lot of interesting stuff to pick up there.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:10.500]   Instead of recognizing that the story was completely far-fetched,
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:14.500]   they had to invent a narrative about why it made sense.
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:17.500]   And then if you basically raise any questions whatsoever
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.500]   about this narrative, you were looked on as if you were
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.500]   like Chinese spokesmen, like a spy or something.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:28.500]   And Sachs, this Pentagon statement came right after Tony Blinken's
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.500]   visit to China, right?
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.500]   He just got back from China, and there was a lot of closed-door meetings,
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.500]   and then they gave the usual hoopla about what was discussed,
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:39.500]   and there was nothing new that was introduced in the public statement
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.500]   about what was discussed behind the closed doors.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.500]   But do you think that maybe there was something that was negotiated
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:49.500]   behind closed doors where they said, "This balloon was not a domestic threat.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.500]   You guys made it out to be--you need to make a statement
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:52.500]   to correct the record"?
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.500]   Yes. I actually think that's exactly what happened.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.500]   As we know, Blinken went to China. He had seven hours of meetings.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.500]   The readout from those meetings said that they were
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   very candid conversations.
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.500]   That's usually diplomatic code for a row, a fight.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.500]   What the fuck are you doing?
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   Yes, exactly.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.500]   And I think the Chinese were very upset that this story
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.500]   was relentlessly pumped for days and days that they were spying on America,
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.500]   and I think they demanded a correction.
[01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.500]   And I think that that is exactly what the Pentagon did,
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.500]   is they put out this press release, they put out this statement.
[01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:27.500]   But the way that the media covered it, it's like the back-page correction
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.500]   of a front-page story.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.500]   I mean, this Chinese spy balloon story went on for days and days and days,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.500]   and the correction gets no coverage.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:40.500]   Now, look, it's also possible that somehow the statement is not true now.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:44.500]   I mean, look, either they were hoaxing us then or they're hoaxing us now
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.500]   because the statement they're saying now is incompatible with what
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.500]   they were saying three months ago.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.500]   But I believe the statement now and not what they were saying three months ago
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.500]   because it just makes a lot more sense.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.500]   But remember, a few months ago, we had mids on Twitter.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:06.500]   It's become a thing.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   Remember when mids on Twitter--
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500]   I invented that.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.500]   I came up with that.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   My take was, "Errant balloon, major provocation, could incite war,
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.500]   blown-up pipeline," referring to Nord Stream,
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500]   which also got blown up around that time.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.500]   "Not a provocation, could never incite war, get it straight."
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.500]   And then the mids on Twitter were, you know,
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:30.500]   you think it was errant, really?
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.500]   And he learned a new vocabulary word.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:37.500]   But in his view, errant was not a strong enough word to describe this
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.500]   unprecedented national security threat.
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   By the way, for those of you listening,
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500]   the mid that responded to Saks was Jason Calacanis,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.500]   formerly of the All-In Pod.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.500]   So funny.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:50.500]   So funny.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.500]   It shows how farcical our political system is because, you know,
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.500]   here's what I think actually happened is that the story just picked up steam
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.500]   because it's too good not to, right?
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.500]   So cable news starts picking it up.
[01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.500]   And everyone's always trying to pump up the threat that China represents
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.500]   because they're our central global competitor now.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:14.500]   And the White House, I think, very early on had a decision to make,
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   which is do you try and fight the story or do you just roll with it?
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.500]   And I think they just decided to roll with it because they would be seen
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:26.500]   as being soft on China if they try to fight it and say it wasn't true.
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.500]   And so then you had this whole farce of them shooting down all these
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.500]   balloons and so forth.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:35.500]   This is the whole course and trajectory right now of the United States,
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:37.500]   Democrats and Republicans,
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:42.500]   both sides of the aisle have this vested belief that we are on a collision
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500]   course with China and, you know,
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:48.500]   whoever kind of steps it up first ends up having the better footing.
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   And so every opportunity that exists, whether it's on chips or Taiwan
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:56.500]   or human rights or the spy balloon,
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:02.500]   is going to be levered and amplified in some way to paint China as this
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:06.500]   conflicting force against the United States in some way.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.500]   And it's not going to get toned down anytime soon.
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   Clearly, this is part of a continuous escalation cycle that may take years,
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:19.500]   may take a decade or two, but ultimately there's going to be a point
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:21.500]   where this all comes to a head.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   And it's really unfortunate to see that rather than have this, you know,
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.500]   deeply cooperative relationship and try and --
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.500]   So you think this thing with China is going to come to a head?
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.500]   At some point, I think we're just going to continue to escalate the tension.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.500]   I'll take the other side of that, too.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:36.500]   What do you mean?
[01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:38.500]   Do you think it's going to be peace and prosperity forever?
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:41.500]   No, I mean, I think I've talked about this a little bit,
[01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.500]   but I think China has just got so many internal issues.
[01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.500]   They're not going to be fighting wars, Babran.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.500]   They're not going to be.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.500]   No, look, I mean --
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.500]   Sorry, Chamath, hold on.
[01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.500]   My point is more around the orientation of the politicians,
[01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:58.500]   and the orientation is we have this escalating force in China,
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.500]   and we need to kind of be ahead of the game.
[01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:02.500]   I'm not sure who's doing that.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:09.500]   Well, I think the point Freeberg is making is that the domestic politics,
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:11.500]   the politics inside the United States,
[01:30:11.500 --> 01:30:17.500]   leads to a cycle of Republicans and Democrats constantly trying to one-up each
[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:21.500]   other in terms of who's hawkish towards China.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   Right, exactly.
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.500]   That's what I think is going on, regardless of what happens on the Chinese side.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:30.500]   And by the way, I mean, their domestic politics probably have the same tendencies.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:35.500]   I'm sure that Xi's got hardliners and hawks around him who don't want to back down.
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:39.500]   I think in a few years from now, we won't be talking about this.
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:42.500]   We talked about Japan for eight, nine years.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500]   We were worried they were the boogeyman.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.500]   They turned out not to be, and we all moved on.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.500]   Yeah, it's a good data point.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.500]   So, yeah, I mean, you're referring to a period, I think,
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:55.500]   it was like the 1980s where Japan was seen as a giant economic threat.
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.500]   Yeah, '82 to '88.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:00.500]   Yeah, but it was never seen as a security threat to the United States.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:05.500]   And China is a different kind of geopolitical competitor, right?
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.500]   There's a very vigorous security competition.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:08.500]   They have a nuclear arsenal.
[01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:09.500]   They have a nuclear arsenal.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500]   They have more people.
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.500]   But we have military bases in Japan.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.500]   It's a client of the United States.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.500]   It was never a security threat to the United States.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.500]   That was resolved a long time ago.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.500]   No, I think that that's fair.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:24.500]   I just think that dollars tend to lead these things, and I think that in the next five
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:28.500]   to six years, five to 10 years, we're not going to be talking about China the same
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:29.500]   way we are today.
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.500]   Okay, prediction made.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:35.500]   We'll come back on episode 1,247.
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.500]   Brad, do our outro.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.500]   I got to fly in three hours.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.500]   I'm flying.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.500]   Hold on, Brad's going to do a really quick.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.500]   Have a great time.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.500]   Brad's going to do a quick science corner for us, and then we're going to wrap.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500]   Brad, go ahead.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.500]   Well, you know, one of the things I love about this pod is we cover everything from
[01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.500]   science to politics.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:59.500]   And Chamath, last year, you know, in his biohacking series, told us all to get pre-nuvo scans,
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.500]   which I did, which is interesting.
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:06.500]   And I think, I don't know, Chamath, maybe 10 people have sent you notes and said, "Hey,
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.500]   you helped me discover a tumor."
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500]   You know, really amazing.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:13.500]   Well, so this year, and I did that, you know, this year you've been talking a lot about
[01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:14.500]   heart flow.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:17.500]   So I said to my general practitioner at my annual checkup, "Hey, I want to do this
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:18.500]   heart flow."
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   And she said, "Oh, you don't need to do a heart flow.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.500]   Your LDLs, all your stuff looks really good."
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.500]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:26.500]   You have a female GP?
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:28.500]   She's fantastic.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.500]   Fantastic.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.500]   Stanford educated, really terrific.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:34.500]   I don't care where she went, but who does the prostate test?
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:35.500]   He does?
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:39.500]   Hey, listen, it's the perks that come along with the female GP.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500]   Checking the PSAs.
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.500]   I mean, no, but seriously, you have a...
[01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:43.500]   Really?
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:44.500]   I do.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.500]   I do.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:46.500]   That's a level of intimacy I didn't expect from you.
[01:32:46.500 --> 01:32:47.500]   Wow.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:53.500]   And so, you know, but what I found interesting is when I suggested I get the heart flow,
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:55.500]   she said, "Oh, you don't need it, et cetera.
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.500]   Your LDLs are low.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.500]   You're very fit."
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.500]   And she said, "But on second, you know, maybe you could go get this calcium score
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:03.500]   test, right?"
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:08.500]   I didn't know anything about this, but, you know, I did a little quick research and it
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:15.500]   turns out a big JAMA study in 2017, over 50% of men and women over the age of 40 carry
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:16.500]   plaque.
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.500]   Plaque's the number one killer.
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:21.500]   It's a source of heart disease and heart attacks.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:26.500]   And as JAMA's been talking about, there's, you know, a prophylactic called statin, which
[01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:32.500]   is basically like a supplement, very little downside, no long-term downside effects, but
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:37.500]   it immediately starts cutting down the amount of fatty cells and plaque that's carried in
[01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.500]   your blood.
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.500]   So I thought it was interesting.
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:43.500]   I went and I had JAMA, as you know, the coronary calcium scan.
[01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:44.500]   It takes five minutes.
[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:46.500]   It costs between $100 and $400.
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:51.500]   The fact that we don't have every person taking this over 40 is crazy and frontline doctors
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.500]   should all be prescribing it, but particularly if there's family history.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:57.500]   Sorry, but did you also do a contrast CT with heart fluid?
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:02.500]   So I started with the calcium score, 150 box over at Stanford, took five minutes.
[01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:07.500]   And, you know, it told me, you know, which wasn't terribly surprising.
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:11.500]   I was one of the 50% that did carry some level of calcium.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.500]   So it was called a non-zero score.
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:19.500]   And then what they suggest is because you have a non-zero score, you get this, you know,
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:25.500]   Chamath, you told me, go do the contrast CT, which then will image what this looks like
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.500]   actually in your artery.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.500]   So this past week in Boston, I did the contrast CT again.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   This took 10 minutes, non-invasive, like, you know, it just, they run you into it too.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.500]   Well, no, invasive, because you have to put the dye.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   So they put the, yes, so a tiny bit, I suppose they shoot a little dye into you, but, you
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.500]   know, didn't feel like anything.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.500]   I was in and out of the place in 40 minutes.
[01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:58.500]   And what it found is, you know, fortunately that very little of this calcium had turned
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.500]   into what they call stenosis, any narrowing of the arteries.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:03.500]   Okay.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:10.500]   But then it gave you just a very clear picture that if you are one of the 50% who carry plaque
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.500]   over the age of 40, you should be on a prophylactic statin.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:19.500]   So as Chamath knows, I signed up to 10 milligrams of Crestar, which I'm taking daily, has had
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:22.500]   zero, you know, zero adverse consequences.
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:26.500]   And in two or three months, they'll test the amount of, you know, we'll revisit this calcium
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   score.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.960]   But when I talked to the head of cardiology, what was so interesting, he said, every one
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.500]   of his friends over the age of 40, he has them do this calcium coronary scan.
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:39.500]   It's so cheap.
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.740]   And if they're zero on their calcium reading, that that's the end of the line.
[01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:49.140]   But if they have a non-zero reading, then he'll do the CT coronary scan, which is again,
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:53.500]   very cheap, more expensive than the calcium test, but very cheap.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:58.780]   And when you think about the cost of the patients in this country, right, in our healthcare
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:03.900]   system due to heart disease, and when you think about the needless lives cut short,
[01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:11.100]   I was shocked how easy all of this was and how empowered I feel by the data and how fortunate
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.340]   I feel that I'm actually taking a supplement.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.620]   I call it a supplement instead of statins because I think statin has some spooky name.
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:21.980]   It sounds to me like a better supplement than any vitamins I can take.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:26.780]   And you know, it's reducing the LDLs or these fatties in your, you know, in your blood.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.840]   And I'll keep you posted.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:28.840]   But I was very grateful.
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.440]   And, you know, as you know, I posted it in our thread.
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:35.420]   And I think all the besties, you know, we saw responses out of a bunch of folks in the
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:40.780]   thread this week are going to go get their calcium, you know, coronary scan.
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:45.740]   And I think it should be common sense on the front lines for people over 40, particularly
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.820]   if there's any family history, go get this calcium test done this summer while you have
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:50.820]   a little extra time.
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:52.780]   There you have it, folks.
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:55.460]   $100 to $400 could save your life.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:56.460]   Calcium coronary scan.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:37:01.660]   Brad Gerstner, thanks so much for Science Corner this week.
[01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   This has been great.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.660]   How did you guys enjoy the show with our new foursome?
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:06.660]   Zach?
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.300]   Zachary Reality Love it.
[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.300]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Love it.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.140]   Zachary Reality I gotta go, boys.
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.140]   I really love you guys.
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.140]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Okay.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:14.140]   Zachary Reality I gotta go to Vegas.
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.140]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Stuff your face with some truffles.
[01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:16.140]   No, no truffles until the fall.
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.140]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Alright, bye-bye.
[01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:18.140]   Zachary Reality Love you guys.
[01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:20.140]   love you guys bye bye

[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:32.140]   and it said we open sourced it to the fans
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:34.140]   and they've just gone crazy with it
[01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:36.140]   I'm the queen of King Kong
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:45.140]   besties are gone
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.140]   that's my dog taking a notice in your driveway
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.140]   where did it go?
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:51.140]   oh man
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:55.140]   we should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:57.140]   cause they're all just useless
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:59.140]   it's like this sexual tension that we just need to release somehow
[01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:03.140]   wet your b-b
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:05.140]   wet your b-b
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:07.140]   we need to get merch
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.140]   besties are back
