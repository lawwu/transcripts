[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   700 million people in the world don't have water.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.840]   I was in Northern Ethiopia once,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.300]   and somebody came up to me in a $5 a night hotel room lobby
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100]   and said, "Hey, you're the charity water guy.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.940]   "We've heard of you.
[00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.760]   "Let me tell you a story."
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.600]   The women in my village,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.120]   they used to all walk eight hours a day.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.540]   And he goes, "There was this one woman,
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.380]   "and at the end of one of her walks,
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.280]   "before she got home, she slipped and she fell,
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.080]   "and all the water that she had just walked for
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.640]   "spilled out into the ground.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.440]   "And she had this clay pot on her back,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   "and the clay pot shattered,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.960]   "and there were shards all over the path."
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240]   And he said, "She didn't go get another pot.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.160]   "She didn't go back and go refill the water."
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.960]   He said, "She took a rope, and she climbed a tree,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   "and she tied a noose around her neck, and she hung herself.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080]   "It's in the center of my village,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.880]   "and we found her body swinging from a tree."
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.680]   And what I didn't know until I lived in this village
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.160]   was that she was 13 years old when she died.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.240]   There's statistics, and then there is the story
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.440]   of a real life person who's just one of those
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.680]   703 million people.
