[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I am of Calvin.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Are we forbidden from making such a claim?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I am of Calvin.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Karen, a listener who loves DG and who recently was in the room with us in Nashville for our first ever live recording together,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   asks it quite pointedly.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for Ask Pastor John.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   In what ways is saying 'I am a Calvinist' or 'I am of Calvin' different than saying 'I am of Paul' or 'I am of Apollos' as Paul warns against in 1 Corinthians 3-4?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Is it different?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   It's an honest question for me, and I hope it does not come across sounding like a personal challenge.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   It's not meant to be.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I thank God for you and your reformed convictions and focus on God's glory, beauty, and all-surpassing worth.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Karen?"
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Is the statement—this is my understanding of what's being asked—
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Is the statement "I am a Calvinist" different from the statements in 1 Corinthians
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   "I am of Paul," "I am of Apollos," "I am of Cephas," which Paul scolded as inappropriate?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And the answer is, "I am a Calvinist" might be guilty of what they are guilty of.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It might be.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And that statement might not be guilty of what Paul is scolding.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So we need to see what Paul was really criticizing and how "I am a Calvinist" might not be sinful
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   the way some of the Corinthians were and how it might be.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Here's what Paul says in 1 Corinthians, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that all of you agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you."
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   What I mean is this, that each one of you says, "I am of Paul," "I am of Apollos," "I am of Cephas," or "I am of Christ."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So what's at issue here?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   What is it about these teachers or the way they are perceived that is creating this quarreling
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and the divisions here in the first chapter of 1 Corinthians and really through the first four chapters?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Wow! Those questions that Paul says, that really does point us to part of the issue, doesn't it?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It seems to me they are magnifying their chosen leaders or celebrities to the point where it's almost as though
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   they are in the place of Christ. Otherwise, why would Paul say, "Is Christ divided?" or "Was Paul crucified for you?"
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Was Paul crucified for you? No! Christ was! So stop treating these other teachers as though they were Christ.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Were you baptized into the name of Paul? No! You were baptized into the name of Christ.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So that's the first tip-off of the problem. The allegiance to a leader is starting to compete with allegiance to Christ.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Things are out of proportion. And then Paul gives another clue. 1 Corinthians 1:17,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's a key phrase. "Not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   This is a clue that what the parties were focusing on, these divisions, these quarreling divisions were focusing on,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   was not different messages from Paul and Apollos and Cephas. Like, they preached three different theologies.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   These were not competing theologies. There's no mention in the first three chapters of 1 Corinthians
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   where this problem is all front and center. There's no mention of any difference between Paul and Cephas and Apollos
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   as to the content of what they preached. What's mentioned is eloquence, verbal giftedness, debating powers.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Chapter 1, verse 20, "Where's the scribe? Where's the debater of this age?"
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Chapter 2, verse 1, "When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Chapter 2, verse 5, "So that your faith might rest not on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They seem to be bragging—these groups, these divisions, factions—they seem to be bragging on the superior,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   gifting, rhetorical gifting, eloquent gifting of their favorite leader.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Who's the better preacher? Who's the better debater? Who's the better writer? Who's the better blogger?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Who's the wittiest? Who's the most culturally savvy? Who's the funniest?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Who's got the best illustrations? You get the idea.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Corinth was full of this kind of thing. One celebrity entertainer exalted above another because of the skill,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   the rhetorical skill and eloquence and savvy that they brought to their message.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And America today is full of this kind of thing.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So Paul's response is this. This is 1 Corinthians 3, 5.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "What then is Apollos? What is Paul?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Servants, servants, slaves, through whom you believed as the Lord assigned to each.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I planted, Apollos watered, God gave the growth.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   but only God who gives the growth."
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So the whole focus of the divisions in Corinth is not on the content of the teaching of these men.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's on their relative effectiveness in communication and debating and eloquence.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And Paul's answer is, first, everything that counts in these men's lives is a gift of God, not human ability.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then he blows the Corinthians away with this crazy, wonderful, beautiful, glorious statement.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Chapter 3, verse 21. "So let no one boast in men."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So stop having this vicarious sense of self-exaltation by identifying with your favorite eloquent preacher.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   "So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   All are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Which is an interesting irony. You don't belong to them.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   They were saying, "I am of Paul. I am of Apollos. I am of Cephas. I belong to them."
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I'm in their camp. And Paul turns around and says, "You don't belong to them. They belong to you."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Wow.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You are children of God. You own the universe.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Stop puffing yourself up as though you were paupers and need to have yourself propped up
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   with some ersatz, vicarious celebrity preacher that you want to belong to.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   So the biggest difference with "I am a Calvinist" and "I am of Apollos" is that Calvinism is a theology,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   not a standard of eloquence. That's the difference.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   "I am a Calvinist" may mean, "I believe all that the Bible teaches,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   including the glory of the sovereign grace of God and salvation." It may mean that.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   That's certainly what I would mean by it. "I believe all that the Bible teaches,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   including the glory of the sovereign grace of God in salvation."
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But all Calvinists and Arminians are sinners. And so it is very possible, indeed it happens,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   that someone might say, "I am a Calvinist," and have the very same sinful attitude
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   as the Corinthians, thinking, "I'll be seen as smarter, daring, or more historic, or more whatever,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   because I have just declared my identification with the great John Calvin,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   or the band of people that I like to associate with called Calvinists.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That would be as sinful as "I am of Paul," "I am of Apollos."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And so, may the Lord give us wisdom and humility to focus on the truth of teachings,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   not the appeal of teachers.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Well, I didn't know where you were going to take this one, Pastor John, but that's insightful. Thank you.
