[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   We are considering at the present time, as most of you will recall, the words found in
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:13.060]   Paul's epistle to the Romans in chapter 13, reading from verse 11 to the end of the chapter,
[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:20.820]   namely to verse 14. Verses 11 to 14 in the 13th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:30.340]   And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake and to sleep, for now is our salvation
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.420]   nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at end. Let us therefore cast
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.940]   off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk honestly as in the day,
[00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.660]   not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying,
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.900]   but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.380]   thereof. We are dealing here with what I've been explaining is the last great argument used by the
[00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.900]   Apostle to encourage these Roman Christians and us and all other Christians to live the Christian
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.660]   life. That's what he's concerned about. He started with this great appeal at the beginning of the
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.220]   12th chapter, and having given a number of detailed instructions, he is now giving us a great argument,
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.420]   a great reason for fulfilling. He's already given us one, which is that love is the fulfilling of
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.740]   the law. But here is another argument, and this is what we may call the eschatological argument.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.460]   Don't be worried about the word. It means the doctrine of the last things, the final development,
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.540]   the ultimate end. And this is an argument which he is now using in order to reinforce this appeal,
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.740]   and that, he says, over and above what I've been saying, in addition to. You can translate it,
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.060]   if you like, in those various ways. Well, now, this is the most important matter. I've been
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.900]   reminding you that this particular argument is one, obviously, that applies and appeals only
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.060]   to Christian people. The world has got its moralists, its ethical teachers, and its moral
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.100]   and ethical systems. But it never uses this motive. It can't. Indeed, it never has many motives to
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.620]   suggest to us. That's why they always fail. But here is a unique argument, a unique appeal. This
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.980]   great doctrine of the last and the ultimate things. Now, let's remind ourselves, the apostle is acting
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.180]   on the assumption that we know these things, and that knowing the time. It refers not only
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.220]   to knowing the time, it refers to our knowledge of all the things that he says in this paragraph,
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.460]   in this particular statement. I've tried to show you that the statement divides itself up quite
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.660]   naturally into a doctrinal aspect and a more practical aspect. The doctrine and the application
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.040]   of the doctrine. Now, at the moment, we are looking at the subsidiary doctrines that are
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.500]   involved in this great general or generic doctrine concerning the last and the ultimate things. And
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.100]   the apostle assumes that we know certain things. We've already considered some of them. He's
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.580]   assuming that we know the real significance and the meaning of this time, the time in which we
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.180]   are living. What a transformation that makes in our whole conception of history. You see,
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.980]   because of the wars in this century, people have become interested in history and in time. But
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.900]   we've seen that here is the only adequate view of time and of history, and it is peculiar to
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.060]   the Christian. This time is the time between the first advent and the second advent of the Son of
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.780]   God. And all about your kings and princes, births, marriages, deaths, wars, and all the rest of it
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.980]   is comparatively insignificant. These are the things that really matter, and this is how you
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.580]   measure time. And we are living in this time between these two mighty cataclysmic events.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.060]   Very well, we've dealt with that. Then we've seen that he also says that he takes for granted
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.260]   our knowledge and our understanding of life in this world. What the world calls enlightenment,
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:45.940]   we call darkness. And that what the world calls life is to us death. What it calls day is to us
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:55.180]   nothing but night. And so we've been looking at our view of life in this world. This is plain
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.540]   Christian teaching. Christ, says Paul, the Son of God, God sent him into the world to deliver us
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:11.740]   from this present evil world. That's the view of the scripture. Now that doesn't mean that we retire
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.260]   out of it, or that we see no value in culture. But giving all these things their maximum content,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.140]   it is an evil world. And we are delivered out of it, translated out of it, into the kingdom
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.220]   of God's dear Son. So that, obviously, we must have as Christians a very special view of life
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.540]   in this world. All that the world gets so excited about doesn't touch us, it doesn't move us. We
[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.220]   see through it. This is the victory that overcometh the world. Even our faith. This world,
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.740]   according to the scripture, is something that's got to be overcome. It's set against us. We are
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.780]   fighting the world, the flesh, the devil. These are antagonists. And the world is against us.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.380]   And we're all having to fight the world. So we've got this peculiar view of it. Well then,
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:09.700]   at the end last Friday night, we began to consider the third thing that he tells us that we know. And
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.700]   that is our outlook on the future. Our outlook on the future. If this is our view of the present,
[00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.860]   what of the future? And here again, our view is quite unique. He puts it in terms of salvation.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:29.500]   Now is our salvation nearer than when we believe? And he talks about the day. The night is fast
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.580]   spent. The day is at hand. We began considering this. Now this is most important. I suggested
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.740]   that a better way of looking at the translation here would be like this. Not so much, for now,
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:49.300]   is our salvation nearer than when we believed, but rather, nearer is of us the salvation.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:55.260]   That's what the apostle actually wrote. Not so much our salvation, which we tend to take in a
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.260]   subjective manner. He is talking about the salvation. And he says as far as we are concerned,
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:10.620]   the salvation is nearer now than when we believed. And I began to show how he clearly, therefore,
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:18.980]   is doing here what he does elsewhere, namely to differentiate between three views of salvation.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.700]   You can regard salvation as something that's already happened. And every Christian is already
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.820]   saved from the guilt of sin and the condemnation of the law. You don't go on asking for that,
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.660]   as a Christian, that's happened to you. You have been delivered from the guilt of sin and
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:43.580]   the condemnation of the law. But we are being delivered continuously, progressively, in the
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:50.980]   matter of sanctification, which is a deliverance from the power and the pollution of sin. That's
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.580]   continuous, that's present. But then, there is a future against the salvation. And that is,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:05.420]   I quoted certain scriptures at the end, last time, indicative of this, referring to the ultimate
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.700]   deliverance, glorification. And that, of course, is in the future. I have been saved, I am being
[00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:21.060]   saved, I shall be saved. Now, those three ways of referring to salvation are plain and clear in the
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.380]   teaching of the scripture. And it's very important that we shouldn't be confused about them. People
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.380]   often have been confused. There are people, you see, who would take a text like this, which says,
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.300]   "Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed," and say, "It is sheer presumption for anybody to
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.500]   say, 'I am saved,' or to ask anybody else, 'Are you saved?' It is presumption," they say, "for
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.180]   anybody to talk about assurance of salvation." They say, "But you can't be. You're only hoping
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.340]   to be saved. Your salvation lies ahead. It's nearer than it was because you're going on,
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.780]   but you mustn't say you are." People have often taken this, and in the language of the Apostle
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:04.940]   Peter, they have rested it to a wrong use, and have employed it as an argument against the whole
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.340]   notion of assurance of salvation. Well, therefore, it is important that we should distinguish these
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.700]   three tenses, if you like, with respect to salvation, or with regard to the New Testament
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.660]   teaching and doctrine concerning our salvation. Well, now, in this particular instance we have
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:28.580]   before us, it is surely perfectly plain and clear that the Apostle is using it in the third sense.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:37.300]   He is talking about this ultimate, final salvation that awaits us. This is something, again,
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.420]   with which we are quite familiar. These terms are used so frequently in the Scripture. It talks
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:51.420]   about the day, or that day, or the day of the Lord, and so on. Now, our Lord himself does this
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   in his own teaching. Let me give you but one example of it. There are many others. Our Lord
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:06.780]   says in Mark 13, 32, "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man." No, not the angels which
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:14.420]   are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. He is referring to that day. He says, "I say unto
[00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.460]   you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:25.860]   away, but my words shall not pass away. But of that day and that hour knoweth no man." Now,
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:33.300]   there is one example. But, as you read our Lord's teaching, you will find that he was constantly
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:41.420]   dealing with this theme. Now, there was a great controversy about all this in the early part of
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:47.340]   this present century. There had been a move towards the end of the last century to teach
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:53.900]   what they called the Jesus of history. They were representing our Lord as just a man and as a great
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:03.380]   religious teacher. He was very little concerned about the supernatural realm and the future and
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.140]   so on. They were trying to reduce him to a moral, ethical teacher, some even to a political teacher.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:17.060]   There was a great movement. But that was exploded by a man whose name is very familiar, Dr. Albert
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.580]   Schweitzer. The fact that he exploded that doesn't mean that he was right, because he wasn't. But he
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:29.140]   exploded that, and he exploded it by showing this, that there was nothing more characteristic of the
[00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:37.260]   teaching of our Lord than this constant emphasis upon this which was going to happen, what he was
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:44.540]   yet going to do, this apocalyptic element in his teaching. Albert Schweitzer, of course,
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:51.180]   regarded this as a sign that our Lord was a creature of his own age, and even suggested
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:57.560]   partly that he was a little bit abnormal in a mental sense, that he was obsessed by this idea,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.940]   that he was going to come again. But what he was able to establish from the Gospels was this,
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:08.980]   that if you took out this apocalyptic element, there was really nothing left at all, and
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.500]   certainly nothing which explains the influence which our Lord had upon his contemporaries.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.060]   Well, now, I leave it at that. I'm just showing that this was a very vital and essential part of
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:27.020]   our Lord's teaching. And if we don't have it in a very prominent position in our thinking,
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:33.860]   we are not true to our Lord's own teaching. But then you get it, strikingly, after he had gone.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:39.780]   It's very interesting how at the very beginning of the Church, Peter, you remember preaching to
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.780]   those people who came crowding round him and John as the result of their healing of the lame men.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.100]   Peter, winding up his sermon, puts it like this, "Repent ye therefore, and be converted,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.780]   that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.940]   Lord. And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven must
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:09.900]   receive, until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:17.260]   all his holy prophets since the world began." Now that's a most striking and important statement.
[00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:23.140]   Peter, there you see, is able to show that this is something that had been preached right away
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:28.180]   through the Old Testament. The Lord himself had preached it, and here is he now as the first
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.300]   spokesman in the Christian Church, giving great prominence to it. And you find it running as a
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:41.220]   theme right through the book of the Acts of the Apostles. You remember the Apostle Paul, in a
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:48.060]   sense, made it the central part of his message in Athens. Athens. Perhaps this will help to fix it
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.580]   in your mind. Think of our friends, Christian people in Athens tonight, and in Greece in their
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:59.940]   trouble. Well, when Paul was there and preaching on Mars Hill, you remember how this was his great
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.220]   point, "That God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the whole world in righteousness by
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.500]   that menum he hath appointed, of which he hath given assurance unto us, in that he hath raised
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.100]   him from the dead." Now, he was preaching to Stoics and Epicureans, philosophers, clever,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.100]   sophisticated people. But that's what he preached to them. He knew that they'd ridiculed it.
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:26.660]   Nevertheless, he preached it because it is an essential and vital part of this Christian
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:34.500]   message. And you remember how, in his second epistle to the Thessalonians, it's a very great
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.860]   and prominent theme. "We beseech you, brethren," he says in the second chapter, "by the coming of
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.740]   our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that he be not soon shaken
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.740]   in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the
[00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:58.300]   day of Christ, better the day of the Lord, is at hand." He's been talking about that day in the
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:05.220]   first chapter, and here he comes back to it again. And indeed, it is a controlling theme.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:12.740]   The Apostle Paul, writing what is agreed by all to be his last letter, which is his second letter
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.580]   to Timothy, in the fourth chapter, you remember, puts it like this, "Henceforth, there is laid up
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:26.180]   for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day."
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:33.340]   He's already said the same thing in the first chapter, in which he says, "The Lord give mercy
[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.780]   unto the house of Onesiphorus, for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:43.820]   But when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:52.860]   that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day." He's already said it about himself. Though he's
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:59.060]   in prison, he's not ashamed. "Which cause I also suffer these things, nevertheless I am not ashamed,
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.700]   for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:13.860]   committed unto him against that day." Here it is. And you see, it is a constant theme in the
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:21.340]   preaching of the great apostle. You remember in Titus chapter 2, verses 11 to 14, he has exactly
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.020]   the same thing, "Waiting for the appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ." There it is.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:36.500]   And it's not confined to Paul. The epistle to the Hebrews uses this as one of its great motives,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:43.140]   as one of its great appeals. Listen to this in chapter 6, verses 11 and 12. "We desire that
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:49.700]   every one of you to show the same diligence unto the full assurance of hope unto the end,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:56.940]   that he be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises."
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:02.460]   And in verse 18, "That by two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:10.660]   we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:17.580]   before us." Here it is. You see, it's everywhere. All these men use it as a great argument. Peter
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:25.260]   does exactly the same thing. James does the same thing. He warns the rich men, for instance,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:34.060]   in his last chapter, to be careful as to how they treat others and so on. Well, Peter, again in his
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:40.220]   first epistle, he's got it. "Build up the lines of your mind. Be sober and hope to the end,
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:47.860]   for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." That third
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:54.220]   chapter of the second epistle, which I've already read to you. And John uses exactly the same
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:59.980]   argument in his first epistle, and of course, the whole of the book of Revelation. It's confined to
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:06.620]   this theme. That's what it's all about. Everything is to be viewed in the light of this great
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:13.580]   teaching about this salvation which is yet to come. Well, now then, it's clear, isn't it,
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:20.180]   as to what he's referring to. This is none other than the great doctrine and teaching concerning
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:29.180]   our Lord's second coming, our Lord's appearing again in this world. He's been here once. He's
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.020]   coming again. The author of the epistle to the Hebrews puts it like this. "As it is appointed
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.940]   unto men once to die, but after this the judgment, so Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:48.780]   many. And unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin." Not in
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:56.620]   connection with sin this time as he did the first time, but unto salvation. You see, this is a theme
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:03.700]   that is intermixed in the very warp and woof of the whole of the New Testament teaching. It's vital,
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:11.260]   and it's generally used, as Paul uses it here, in terms of a great appeal for conduct and behavior
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:18.340]   on the part of Christian people who believe and who know these particular things. Well, now then,
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:26.220]   again, you see, we are obviously dealing with something that is quite unique and confined
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:32.020]   solely to Christian teaching. Nobody else knows anything about this at all, and they're not only
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:38.340]   not interested in it, they'll ridicule it, they'll laugh at it. This, to them, is a kind of joke,
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.780]   the kind of foolish thing that is believed by these obscurantists who call themselves
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.940]   Christian. But, you see, it is absolutely essential to the whole of the New Testament
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:56.660]   teaching. It's not merely a doctrine. It's used in this particular way, as the apostle is using it
[00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:01.260]   here, and that's what I must try to show you. But in order that we may gather the full weight
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:08.100]   of the doctrine and the teaching, we've got to be clear as to what the teaching is. No,
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:15.860]   knowing. We are to know this. Well, so we must know something about the form in which this great
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.260]   event is going to take place. And there's no difficulty about this. We are given abundant
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:27.340]   teaching. You remember what was told to those apostles standing on Mount Olivet, still looking
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.860]   up into heaven. While they looked steadfastly towards heaven, as he went up, behold, two men
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:39.820]   stood by them in white apparel, which also said, "You men of Galilee, why stand you gazing up into
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:45.460]   heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:54.220]   ye have seen him go into heaven." There it is. He will come in a visible form. It's not a spiritual
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:00.740]   coming, as many have tried to explain it away. It is to be a visible coming. Our Lord taught
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.780]   exactly the same thing. He says, "They shall see the Son of Man coming, riding upon the clouds of
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:14.580]   heaven, surrounded by all his holy angels." That's his own teaching. The book of Revelation is full
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:23.140]   of this. "Every eye shall see him." This is the emphasis everywhere. It is to be visible. It is
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:31.340]   to be in a body, a glorified body, but still in a body. "As he has gone, so," say these angels here.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:37.780]   Therefore, this is an essential part of this teaching. It's going to be the mightiest event
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:46.100]   that the cosmos has ever known or ever can know, when he appears again. Not as he came as a babe
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:52.660]   the first time, but as the great King of kings and Lord of lords, conquering and to conquer.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:58.620]   So, it's going to be essentially visible, something that will be seen with the naked eye,
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:06.020]   and he will be in his glorified body. But why will he come? What is the purpose of his coming?
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:13.420]   This, again, is equally clear. He will come to complete the work. Now, when I say complete,
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:18.340]   I'm not talking about the work of atonement. That's already complete. It doesn't complete
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:28.100]   that. But he does come to complete the work for which he originally came into the world
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:34.140]   and was sent into the world to accomplish. What's that? Well, again, John, in his first epistle,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:40.060]   answers the Christian in the third chapter. He has come to destroy the works of the devil.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:50.060]   He's come to undo, to nullify everything that the devil has done. There it is put in its general
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:57.860]   form, and I shall refer to other elements of it as we go along. But what immediately will happen
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.900]   will be, there will be a general resurrection, both of the good and of the bad. Our Lord
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:11.860]   himself taught that. The resurrection of the good and the bad, you'll find it in John 5, 24 and 25,
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:22.900]   and so on. Rising from the dead, and that for the purpose of the judgment which he has come
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:28.860]   to execute. That's what Paul was referring to, of course, in Athens, when he said that God hath
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.420]   appointed a day in which he will judge the whole world in righteousness by that man whom he hath
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:39.540]   appointed. Our Lord taught the same thing. You've got it in Matthew 25, in the three pictures,
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:48.100]   the three parables in Matthew 25. In each case, he emphasizes this element of judgment. And he
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:56.700]   will return to judge, and to pass a sentence and judgment. And then, having done that,
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:03.060]   he will set up his eternal kingdom of glory, as Peter puts it in the third chapter of the
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.820]   second epistle we read at the beginning, "There shall be a new heavens and a new earth wherein
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.900]   dwelleth righteousness." Now, there it is in general terms, but let's look a little more
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.500]   closely at the consequences. Because if this whole argument that the Apostle is putting before us,
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.980]   is to carry weight with us and to influence us, well then, we must know the teaching in detail.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:35.060]   And these are the things which are emphasized here everywhere. The first thing, and we must
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.740]   put this first in view of what the Apostle is saying in this context, is this, "Time shall be
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:51.140]   no more." That's a great statement. You see, now we are living in this peculiar time. Knowing the
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:25:00.620]   time, we are still in that position. But then, when he has come, "Time shall be no more." Time
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:10.580]   comes to an end. God starts time, he ends time. Time shall be no more. What else? Well, Peter has
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:18.860]   told us in that chapter, the elements shall melt with fervent heat. There shall be a purging of
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:26.460]   all the effects of evil and sin out of the whole cosmos. Well, we must realize always that it isn't
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:32.620]   merely man who has fallen, the whole of creation has fallen with him. The Apostle has already
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:41.060]   reminded us of that in the eighth chapter. So, you see, in order to get rid of all the works and the
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:48.180]   effects of the devil and of evil and of sin, the very elements are going to be melted with fervent
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:56.140]   heat. There's going to be a dissolution, so that evil and all its influences and pollution can be
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:03.980]   purged out of the entire cosmos. And that, of course, is but preliminary to a kind of grand
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:12.780]   reconstruction of the entire universe. Now, our Lord himself taught this. Let me give you the
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:18.380]   text in which this is stated most plainly, in the 19th chapter of the Gospel according to St.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:28.820]   Matthew. Let me read at verse 27. "Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:36.740]   all and followed thee. What shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto them, Verily I
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:47.260]   say unto you, That ye which have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:55.340]   in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:04.700]   Israel." Now, that's the interesting word there, of course, is this word "regeneration". We are
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.660]   familiar with the term "regeneration" in what happens to us when we are born again, when we
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.580]   become Christians. Well, it has the same general meaning here. But now, of course, it's not
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:20.300]   speaking to anything that happens in us. This is something that's going to happen to the whole
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:30.140]   universe, to the entire cosmos. There will be a reconstituting of the entire cosmos. You see,
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:37.380]   because of the Fall, as I say, the whole universe has become involved and has become affected. And
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:44.420]   the universe, as you and I see it now, is not as it was in its original creation. But it will be,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:51.460]   when this great regeneration takes place, after our Lord has returned and has caused the elements
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.580]   to melt with a fervent heat, and so on, getting rid of sin and evil, then this kind of great
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:03.580]   reconstitution of all things. Well, the best statement of this in many ways is the one we've
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:12.020]   already considered when we were studying the eighth chapter from verse 18 to verse 23. "For
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:20.100]   I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:27.260]   shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:33.980]   manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject of vanity, not willingly, but by
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:40.780]   reason of him who had subjected the same in hope. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:48.300]   from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:55.380]   the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." Now, that's what I'm
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:04.780]   referring to. That's the exposition of that word used by our Lord, that word "regeneration." You
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:13.900]   see, the creature means creation, not only the animals, but everything, the rocks, the flowers,
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:23.340]   the trees, everything is bearing marks of the fall of man. When man fell, you remember, part of the
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:30.580]   punishment was that God cursed the ground, and later you have the flood, with all the cataclysmic
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:37.900]   events involved in the flood. Now, all that is what's going to be done away with, and the whole
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:47.580]   cosmos, the whole universe, is to be restored to its original perfect condition, as it was created
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:54.020]   by God. And the Apostle, if you like, states exactly the same thing again in Ephesians 1 and
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:30:01.900]   in verse 10. He says that "God hath made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:09.380]   good pleasure which he purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:16.540]   might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in him and which are on earth,
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:24.700]   even in him." Now, that's a wonderful statement of it again, and we must never diminish this in
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:32.620]   any way whatsoever. That is what's going to happen when the Lord Jesus Christ comes again
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:40.300]   into this world. Not only man, but the whole universe will be involved in what will happen.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:47.980]   But to come to human beings, we've got to indicate that this is the thing which the world is so
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:58.140]   ignorant of, that to the world all this will mean condemnation and a committal to eternal punishment.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:05.420]   The devil and all the fallen angels, and all who've listened to them and been duped by them,
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:13.980]   and who've served them rather than served God, will be cast to everlasting destruction from
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:22.260]   the presence of the Lord. Now, this is, of course, something that the world regards as monstrous,
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:30.780]   impossible, and ridiculous. But this is the plain teaching of the Scripture. The Apostle Paul puts
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:35.900]   it, of course, in a terrifying manner in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, as I was
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:42.660]   saying just now in the first chapter. But it's quite plain and clear everywhere throughout the
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:49.060]   Scriptures. He says, "When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.820]   in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:03.820]   Jesus Christ, we shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:10.460]   the glory of his power, when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in them
[00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:18.980]   that believe in that day." Now, there it is. The world knows nothing about this, and that's why it
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:25.740]   is as it is. That's why it lives as it does. But our Lord had taught the same thing. He talked about
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:31.420]   the place where there were and dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. It is he who said that there
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:40.020]   shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. It is he who spoke about Dives and Lazarus,
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:50.860]   and pointed out that a great gulf is fixed, and that if we belong to that section where Dives
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:56.740]   was, well, there is nothing to anticipate but terrible punishment. But listen to our Lord
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.860]   stating this in the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, where, as I say, in his three
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:12.340]   parables, he deals with this very issue. Listen to it. Here it is. Our Lord is turning to those
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:23.460]   on his left hand, and he says, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:34.860]   devil and his angels." And he repeats it again, "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment,
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:44.020]   but the righteous into life eternal." Now, if you believe the scriptures, if you believe that
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:54.380]   these are the divinely inspired words of God himself, given through men, this is the teaching
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:34:00.220]   of the entire Bible. The whole of the Bible is leading up to this. And it is inevitable,
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:06.980]   of course. Otherwise, the devil has defeated God. This must be the end, and we are told quite
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:14.100]   plenty by the Lord himself and by his apostles, as we have been previously told, but by the prophets
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:20.540]   who foresaw his coming and who generally fuse, as it were, the first and the second comings,
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:28.700]   the day of vengeance of our God. There it is. It is the plain teaching of the whole of the
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:35.580]   scriptures. But the thing I want to leave uppermost in your minds this evening is the
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:43.140]   consequences of the second coming and appearing of our blessed Lord and Savior to believers,
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:49.100]   to Christians. Because that is, after all, what the apostle is saying here. He is addressing
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:55.420]   members of the Church. And while he reminds them that he has taught them about the general
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:00.180]   consequences of our Lord's coming and the consequences to unbelievers, he is particularly
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:07.740]   concerned about all this with respect to those who are believers. You know, he says, about this
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:13.820]   great day that is coming. Now, what do we know about it? How does this become a motive for
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:22.260]   Christian holy living? Well, you can divide it like this. What will be the effect of the Lord's
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:28.620]   coming again to judgment and to wind up the whole of salvation? What will be its effect upon
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:35.980]   believers? Is there anyone here, I wonder, who will be surprised when I say that one of its
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:46.860]   effect upon believers will be to judge us also? It will involve us in a judgment. But let's be
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:54.260]   clear about this. Not a judgment in the sense that our salvation will be in question, isn't
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:36:01.980]   it? It is what is called a judgment of rewards. Now, listen to the evidence. John, in his first
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.940]   epistle, in the second chapter, twenty-eighth verse, puts it like this, "And now, little children,
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:19.700]   abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:29.380]   his coming." There it is. "That when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:37.300]   before him at his coming." Now, he doesn't say that we shall be lost when he comes. There is,
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:43.980]   therefore, now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. That's settled. But though you
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:51.140]   are saved, you may be ashamed at his coming. His coming will judge us. Now, that's the motive that
[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:58.100]   Paul is using as an argument. He says, "You know that he's coming very well." Remember this. Be
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:03.740]   careful that you're not ashamed when he comes. But let me give you another example of the same
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:10.980]   kind of teaching. In the first epistle to the Corinthians, in the third chapter, Paul is dealing
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.100]   with the whole respective position of himself and Apollos. The silly people in Corinth have been
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.500]   putting one up against another. So he says, "We are laborers together with God. You are God's
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.620]   husbandry. You are God's building. According to the grace of God which is given unto me,
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.660]   as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:36.460]   let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay than that is
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:42.220]   laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now, if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones,
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:50.980]   wood, hay, stubble, listen, every man's work shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it,
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:58.820]   because it shall be revealed by fire. And the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:05.180]   If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:12.940]   man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire."
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:21.380]   Now that's a perfect statement of it. The question of our salvation is not involved. But what is
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:28.820]   involved is the question of our reward. It is possible for a man to suffer loss, and all is
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:35.860]   done as if it were to be useless. He himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire. Now, these are the
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.220]   things that we've got to bear in mind. This is of the very essence of Paul's argument to us,
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:49.140]   a judgment of our works, a judgment of reward. And again, he repeats that in the second epistle to
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:59.140]   the Corinthians, and in chapter 5. I'm beginning to read at verse 8. "We are confident, I say,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:04.220]   and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. Wherefore we
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:12.100]   labour, that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all appear before
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:19.420]   the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.940]   to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." He's writing solely about Christians here. "Knowing
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:31.100]   therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   trust also are made manifest in your consciences." Now, there is no question about this. Judgment,
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:46.940]   says Peter, must begin at the house of God. And that is the sort of judgment that is going to
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:53.220]   begin in the house of God. Very well then, the first thing we've got to realize about the second
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.500]   coming of the Lord, as far as we are concerned, is that it will judge us. I'm emphasizing this.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:02.620]   I know many people who are very interested in the whole matter of the second coming. They
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:08.660]   regard themselves as experts on it, and times and seasons, they never mention this. They couldn't
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:13.060]   talk so glibly about the other aspect, if they will. This is the first thing to emphasize,
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:19.420]   that every one of us must appear before the judgment throne, or judgment seat of Christ,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:26.380]   and give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. We are going to be
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:32.500]   judged, not in the sense of salvation as the unbeliever, but in this sense of reward. What
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:45.540]   else? Well, it will mean that we shall see him, and see him as he is. That is the prospect awaiting
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:53.380]   us as Christian people. I go beyond that. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:41:01.220]   But if you really want to know the fullness of this salvation, the thing to emphasize, of course,
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:07.620]   is that it involves the body, as well as the spirit, and the soul. Listen to Paul in Romans
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:12.820]   8, 11. "If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:19.380]   Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you." And in
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:24.620]   the 23rd verse, he's talked about the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain together
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:30.780]   until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the spirit. We
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:38.260]   ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. The
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:44.660]   body is going to be redeemed. It is going to be glorified. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God."
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:49.580]   It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know this, that when he appears, we shall see him
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:56.060]   as he is, and we shall be like him. That's glorification. The entire man shall have been
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:02.620]   completely and perfectly redeemed. There will be no trace in any part of us, body, soul, or spirit,
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:10.180]   of the effects of the devil, the effects of sin, and of evil. All the works of the devil shall be
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:16.860]   taken out of us, as from the whole cosmos, and we shall be perfect and entire, without spot or
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:25.660]   wrinkle or any such thing in the presence of God. And in addition to that, and if this isn't a motive
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:32.180]   that works with us, whatever will. Not only will all this happen to us, but we shall be privileged
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:39.340]   to hear certain words uttered by God himself. Listen to them. In Matthew 25, our Lord himself
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:45.500]   spoke these words. He's dealing with the second people to whom the Lord had given certain talents.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:53.780]   His Lord said unto him, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.380]   few things; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:06.740]   He's talking about his future coming, and that's how he puts it. Take verse 33. "He shall set the
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.580]   sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left hand." No, let me take verse 23. "His Lord
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:17.500]   said unto him," another servant, "Well done, good and faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:24.500]   a few things; I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:31.780]   Verse 34, "Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand," listen to this, "Come,
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:42.660]   ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:49.460]   world." Is there anything that can equal that? That God, that you'll hear this great word uttered,
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:55.740]   "The king shall say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father," this is the
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:44:02.940]   Lord speaking, "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. And finally,
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:13.780]   the righteous shall go unto life eternal." These are but some of the things that await us who know
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:21.860]   these things. Let the Apostle himself put it again in that most moving statement he makes in his last
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:29.180]   epistle, 2 Timothy chapter 4, "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:38.060]   end. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my cause. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:45.420]   is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:55.180]   that day. And not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing." That's what we are
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:00.780]   looking forward to. These are the things we know, that we are going to receive a crown of righteousness
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   from his blessed hands. We shall be crowned. The crowning day is coming by and by. And then,
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:20.380]   as Paul works out so gloriously in 1 Corinthians 13, "Now we know in part. Then shall I know,
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:32.860]   even as I am already known. Full knowledge, full understanding, full enjoyment, full enjoyment,
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:44.340]   full unmixed, and evermore." Now, you see, the Apostle compresses all that and infinitely more
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:56.180]   into this brief statement that we are examining together. Our salvation is nearer than when we
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:01.180]   believe. The salvation is nearer than when we believe. That's it. That's what he's talking
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:06.740]   about. Now that's true of us. Here we are in the flesh tonight. That's what we are going on to.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:13.980]   This is the motive. This is the appeal. This is the argument. My dear friends, do we know this?
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:22.260]   Are we living by this? Is this the grand motive in our lives? This is the Christian position.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:30.620]   This is the thing by which we should live. This is the thing on which we should live. It's this,
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:36.420]   you see, that enables the Apostle to face all possibilities at the end of the eighth chapter
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:41.820]   of this great epistle to the Romans. "Led a sheep to the slaughter, suffered, and buffeted every day,
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.820]   but it doesn't matter. I know, I am persuaded, I am certain, that neither death, nor life,
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.940]   nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height,
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:57.820]   nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:03.580]   Christ Jesus our Lord, or the grand leap which He has made earlier on, whom He justified them,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:12.820]   He also glorified them." Are you living in the light of your glorification, of which I have
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:24.820]   reminded you this evening of some of the details? Do you know about the salvation? The day, that day,
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:35.020]   the day of the Lord, the day of the Son of God, His glorification finally, fully, ours also,
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:42.540]   and the devil and all that belonged to him destroyed and banished forever and forever.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:50.340]   May God, by His Spirit through the Word, bring these things to our knowledge in a living manner.
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:48:00.260]   O Lord, our God, we pray Thee to write them upon our minds and upon our very hearts,
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:08.180]   that our wills shall be governed by them. We thank Thee, O Lord, again for Thy Word,
[00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.220]   and for Thy tenderness and kindness in revealing these blessed things to us,
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:19.900]   while we are yet in this world of time, that we may not only rejoice in the knowledge of what
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:27.540]   awaits us, but that we may feel the power and the influence of these things in our daily lives and
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:36.300]   living. O God, write them upon our minds and hearts. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:42.740]   Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:51.860]   continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly
[00:48:51.860 --> 00:49:05.020]   life and pilgrimage, and until the day shall dawn, and He shall appear, and we shall see Him as He
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:13.700]   is, and be made like unto Him. Amen. We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr.
