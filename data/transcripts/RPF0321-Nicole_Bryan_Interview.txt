[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we interview Nicole Bryan.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.760]   Nicole has a fantastic story.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.000]   She began her career with very few advantages working as a teacher in the school system.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.120]   However, at this point, she's managed to build financial freedom to the point where by the
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.360]   age of 40, she anticipates being completely financially free.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.040]   Nicole, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.200]   Nicole Bryan, Founder, Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.880]   Thank you for having me.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.160]   So I've invited you on.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   You're a listener of the show and you have your own unique financial journey to share.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.240]   I love to have listeners of the show on because it profiles that you don't have to be a world
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.360]   famous financial expert in order to share real life experiences with other people.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.400]   So I'd love you to start simply by sharing with us a little bit about your story as it
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   relates to money.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   Nicole Bryan, Founder, Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400]   Sure.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.720]   I am originally from Jamaica.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.120]   I came to the US when I was 13.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.840]   And so we grew up pretty much in poverty, even though it didn't feel like it as a child.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.320]   Now in retrospect, I realize that we really didn't have a lot.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640]   My parents struggled a lot throughout.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.360]   We celebrated when my dad would get a job.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.240]   We would always like go outside and like dance and celebrate.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.600]   Then I went to boarding school when I got to the States.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.840]   Then to Georgetown.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.400]   And I remember when I graduated, my dad, you know, said to me, "You're going to go out
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   and make money now, right?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.360]   You're going to become an attorney or something huge where you won't ever have to worry about
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.880]   money again."
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I was like, "Well, I'm actually going to be a teacher."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.720]   He was really bummed.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080]   I will never forget.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.560]   And I said to him, "But you don't have to worry about me.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.880]   I promise you I will take care of my money.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.480]   I'll take care of my finances, even though I'll be making less than $30,000 a year.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.160]   And I owe Georgetown a whole bunch of money."
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:00.280]   And so I think my journey started there because I actively started to educate myself on finances.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   I read a whole bunch of books, Suz Orman from back in the day, anything I could get my hands
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.680]   on because I really wanted to follow my passion at the time, which was to teach and help kids
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.600]   in the inner city.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   But I didn't want to be a burden to my parents.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   And so that's my story.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.520]   Since then, I've done a whole lot with it.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.760]   I started to use my summers as a teacher to do real estate first as an agent and then
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.480]   later as an investor.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.800]   And then over time, I've really built a real estate portfolio as well as my financial knowledge
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   that's now allowing me to provide a lot of support to friends, families, and colleagues.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   And you're on the cusp of financial independence, right?
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   Very soon.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.120]   Oh my gosh, Joshua.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880]   I am on the cusp.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.960]   I cannot wait.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   I can't tell you.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   I cannot wait.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.520]   So is this accurate?
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   You're on track.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   You're almost 40.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.200]   You're on track to be financially independent at the age of 40.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.360]   And throughout your career, you've worked in public education.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   Is that accurate?
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   Throughout my career, yes.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.000]   I have not left the public education sphere.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.360]   However, I have used some of my summers or evenings at some points when I was able to
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.600]   build a real estate portfolio on the side.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   Awesome.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   So we'll get into some of those details.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.120]   But first, I want to ask a question about growing up in Jamaica.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.920]   So do you have any insight?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.020]   What was it like to have a family income that was seasonal?
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.720]   You said you would celebrate when your dad got a job.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.160]   What would your family's financial situation be like when he was working versus when he
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.960]   was not working?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.080]   Interestingly, I think it was more difficult when we came to the States, to be honest.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.660]   My dad had more consistent work when we lived in Jamaica.
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.140]   He was a correctional officer.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.820]   And so at times, there were down times, but he mostly was working.
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.960]   My mom's a stay-at-home mom.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.680]   Times were still tough because it's Jamaica.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680]   Income wasn't great.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   It was a family of four kids.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.920]   We would celebrate when he would have some downtime to make his clothes because he was
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920]   a tailor.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.320]   So we rarely bought clothes.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.760]   It was a lot harder when we came to the US.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   We moved to Brooklyn.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.560]   We lived in an apartment.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.080]   And I felt it a lot more there.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.080]   And I think it's because we had less family support.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.600]   We didn't know that many people.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   And I think it was just more expensive to live in America.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.760]   It just is.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.600]   There's a lot more debt in this country.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.280]   Why was his work seasonal?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.840]   Or why was his work intermittent?
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.040]   In the States or in Jamaica?
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.380]   In the States.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.120]   Because he didn't really have a career.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.000]   My parents didn't graduate from high school.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.840]   They came here as immigrants in their early 30s.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.240]   And you get a job for a while, and then you get laid off.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.320]   Or you came here in the '90s.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   It just was never consistent.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.320]   How were they?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.000]   He worked in various factories, and then he would get laid off a lot.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.460]   How are they doing now?
[00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.460]   A lot better, actually.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.520]   Both are doing a lot better.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.860]   My parents are very driven and very hardworking.
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.800]   And so even without having a high school degree, they've done well for themselves.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.720]   I mean, there's just a lot to be said for getting up at 5 a.m. no matter what.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.040]   Getting up on time.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.440]   Going the extra mile.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.040]   My parents both embody that.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   They just do.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   And I think that's a secret to their success.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.720]   My dad is a truck driver.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   He works a lot.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.520]   He works for Amazon and does a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.720]   He feels good about his finances.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.580]   He doesn't complain about it anymore.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.040]   And my mom is in the healthcare industry.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.200]   She's a nursing -- a private nurse assistant.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.560]   And she just gets called from all these wealthy people who always want to work with her because
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.520]   she's so awesome at it.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.240]   She takes care of their parents, their elderly parents, and she's great.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   So they're doing well.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.800]   So let's go back to your story now and chart out the specific steps that you've taken that
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.280]   have brought you to, as we said, right on the verge of financial independence at this
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   point.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.080]   At what age did you graduate from college, and what was your financial situation at that
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.080]   time?
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.560]   I graduated at age 22.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.960]   I had just turned 22.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.360]   I had about $30-something thousand in debt, student loan debt, and about $8,000 in credit
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.280]   card debt.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.760]   But beyond that, I didn't have any other debt.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.520]   So I'd say maybe about $40-something thousand in debt.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.480]   And I was working as a teacher, making about $30,000, if not a little bit less.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   Did you have any money or any savings to offset that debt?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   No way.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   No way.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.480]   I had to pay my way through college.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.360]   I supported myself through college.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.040]   So how did you live as a new teacher making a relatively low income?
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.960]   How did you live in order to be able to make progress toward your debt?
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.360]   It's a great question.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.440]   I did what I think everyone should do, and what most millennials are doing now, but back
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.760]   in the days it wasn't that popular.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.280]   I moved back home.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.880]   I moved home for about three years.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.120]   And within that time frame, I paid off all of my debt.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.880]   I put all my money towards my debt.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   And by the time I moved out, I moved out into my first home.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.720]   I was about 25.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.360]   I saved aggressively.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.400]   I worked every summer.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.360]   And because I was teaching, I think my job paid.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.480]   We had a loan forgiveness program, so they helped me with like, I don't know if it was
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.080]   10% of my debt or 20%.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.440]   I got some support because I was working in the inner city, and there was a loan forgiveness
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.640]   program, so that helped too.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.600]   What did you do during the summer to earn extra income?
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.080]   I taught summer school, and I got a real estate license, so I started selling houses.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   Tell me about that process.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.520]   What inspired you to go into real estate?
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:20.000]   My dad had a friend in his 60s who owned a real estate company.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.040]   I don't know what, I don't even know how it started.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.200]   He was working with someone.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   He came by the house, and we just started talking.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.000]   He talked to me about how it worked.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.640]   I had always been ambitious and liked to try new things, so I was like, "Okay, I have my
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   summers off.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   What if I try?"
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.640]   He said, "That would be great.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.320]   You could work in my office once you get your license."
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   And so I just, I did it.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.280]   I took my, you know, when summertime came around, I did both summer school and got my
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.880]   license and started working in real estate.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.760]   I think mostly through him.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.920]   And along the way, I decided it just made sense for me to buy my own house because of
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.560]   what I was learning.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   How many real estate transactions were you doing over the course of the years?
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.880]   I'm trying to get a sense of what your weekly schedule might be.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.040]   So tell me a little bit about how you integrated these two things and how many transactions
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   you did, et cetera.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.520]   That's a great question.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.320]   I would say over, it depends.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.000]   So during the summer, I was able to do a lot more because I had more time.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   So I don't know, maybe in an eight-week period, four or five transactions maybe.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.800]   Maybe four on average.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.200]   I was very active.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.840]   But then when the school year started, it may have been maybe four throughout the entire
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.760]   year.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:37.720]   So we're talking about an extra, I mean, what, would you make three, four, I mean,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.440]   four or $5,000 per transaction?
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.000]   How much extra money were you making?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   About three, four.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.240]   I was making about 15 to 20,000 extra.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.480]   I remember my salary, I think maybe my fourth year into teaching or fifth year, I was making
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.920]   60,000 from my teaching job.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.800]   And I remember making 80,000 for the year because I had brought in another 20,000 from
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   my real estate work.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   That's awesome.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.880]   That's awesome.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.240]   Now you then started investing.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.640]   So when did you start buying properties?
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:13.600]   I started buying, I think around 2005, around that horrible time to start buying.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.320]   In retrospect, it was not the best time.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.960]   I bought my first home, I paid $160,000 for it.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.720]   And then a year later, I bought a townhouse down the street for 180.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.040]   This was back when banks were just giving away money.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   Remember those days?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.040]   Indeed.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:34.400]   You know, you could be 24 and cool as you're still going to get money from the banks.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.280]   Then I bought another property for like 200,000, moved out of my first home, moved into that
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.840]   property, rented my first home.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:48.800]   And so by 2007, I had about five properties that I had purchased.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.520]   And then the housing bust hit.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.480]   And then my properties depreciated about 40%.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.760]   Depreciated, went down in value by 40%.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760]   Went down in value.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.200]   That must have been not a very fun net worth statement to create after that.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.640]   Oh my gosh.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.560]   I remember like around 2007, I was like, "Oh yeah, my net worth is about 300,000 and I'm
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   like 27."
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.160]   I was like, "Yes, I'm on track.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.360]   Millennial status is coming up."
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.160]   And then the following year, I was like, "Okay, I don't have any money."
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.840]   But the good news is that the properties were not...
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.960]   The mortgage, the rents covered the mortgages.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:34.400]   And so even though I had lost a strong equity position, my tenants were still paying the
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400]   mortgage.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   So it wasn't the end of the world.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.040]   I could still like wait it out, which I did.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.880]   I think the good news at that time also is that my income was starting to increase because
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.080]   I became a principal for an elementary school.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.480]   And so I had like a 15, 20% pay increase.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.000]   And then a couple of years later, I started managing principals.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.840]   So even though my investments weren't doing well in terms of a passive income and equity
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.940]   perspective, my active income was increasing.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.840]   And so that helped me a lot during that time.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.200]   Was the primary focus in transitioning to more of a management and leadership role the
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   increase of income or something else?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   No, it definitely wasn't just the increase in income.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.240]   I've always been a hard worker.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.280]   I had learned a lot and I was doing really well.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.040]   I was doing really well in my school.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.080]   I had transitioned to a charter school in a curriculum director position.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.960]   And my second year in, the principal stepped down and the CEO approached me to become the
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   principal.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   I mean, I had no experience.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.000]   I was terrified.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.020]   But I had been doing a lot of teacher development work as a curriculum director.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.660]   I had built really strong relationships and I was learning the industry really well from
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.860]   an admin perspective.
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.700]   And so it was a leadership role that I felt like I needed to do to push myself to become
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:08.060]   a better leader and to help even more kids, which was always the passion.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.140]   I grew up in Jamaica as a poor kid.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.420]   When I was 14, I got a scholarship to go to an awesome boarding school.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.100]   And as a result, I got into Georgetown and it changed my trajectory.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.100]   So I always wanted to give back to kids who were from underserved areas, who were living
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.660]   in poverty, because my experience was that education was the way out.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.020]   So I had an opportunity to help even more kids as a principal and I did.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.460]   My income went up.
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:43.740]   I actually feel like during those years, like 2008 to '11, I was working like 24/7 as a
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.980]   principal and getting my doctorate degree.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.620]   It actually would have been a better time to invest in real estate.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.620]   I was so busy.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.900]   Now, in retrospect, I'm like, "What if I had bought 10 more properties in 2008?
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.660]   I'd already be financially free."
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:05.260]   I couldn't focus on it because I was learning how to be a principal, how to manage adults
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.460]   and 450 kids, and I was in grad school getting my doctorate.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.460]   So I couldn't even...
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.740]   I had no extra time to do anything else.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.760]   But in retrospect, financially, it would have been way better for me to have doubled down
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.980]   earlier and picked up more properties.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:21.980]   I still had good credit.
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.900]   So during the down cycle, you basically sat to the side focusing on your academics and
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:33.140]   your job, but your portfolio continued because the tenants were paying your mortgages.
[00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.380]   Did you start buying properties again at some point in the future?
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.380]   I did in 2011.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.020]   What caused that change to where you started buying again?
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.700]   I had such a long...
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.180]   I'm going to try to make it short.
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:52.500]   After I purchased my fifth property, I moved... my parents had decided to start a business
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.780]   and they wanted me to help because, you know, to help lead that business.
[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.500]   It was a group home for the elderly.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.220]   They wanted to purchase a property, get patients, and I would help run it with them.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.220]   So I moved back in.
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:10.340]   I rented my home, moved back in with my parents to help start the business.
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:16.140]   And a week later, my dad said, "I changed my mind."
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.140]   Thanks for telling me now, Dad.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.620]   I was like, "I have tenants in my property who just signed a one-year lease."
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.060]   I was like, "This is ridiculous."
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.780]   I was so annoyed.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.460]   I ended up staying with my parents for longer than I had planned on.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.180]   During the time that I stayed with them, they ended up getting a divorce.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.180]   Oh, wow.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.780]   So they got a divorce.
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.220]   It was not pleasant.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.360]   My parents and I started arguing.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:47.080]   I moved into a studio apartment for like 700 bucks a month and lived there until I could
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.600]   save enough to buy another property.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   Because I never, I was like, "Renting is not for me."
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.080]   And when I started looking in 2011, I was like, "Oh my God.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.880]   What have I been doing for all these years?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.600]   These properties are like half price."
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   So between 2011 and 2014, I bought like four or five other properties.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.120]   There was such a difference in the market.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.440]   It was a buyer's market, a lot of inventory, tons of room to negotiate.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.520]   I was like, "Oh my God."
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.520]   There's just so much wealth building potential in this market and I took advantage of it.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.040]   What type of real estate investment strategy have you pursued?
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   I think when I just started, it was purely speculative.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.840]   Everybody else was doing this whole, "Just buy real estate.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.080]   It's going to go up and cash out later on."
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:43.320]   I think after I experienced the downturn and saw what it did to my equity and net worth,
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:50.120]   I did a lot more reading and educating myself and realized that investing in for cashflow
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.880]   was the way to go.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.400]   So at this point, I'm definitely a buy and hold investor.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.800]   I purchased for cashflow.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.560]   The property appreciates in value great, but that's not what I go in for.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   And my strategy is to buy properties in solid condition that don't need a lot of work and
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:16.960]   markets where the vacancy rates are average or below average, where I can get a 20% cash
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:27.200]   on cash return and in the next three years, replace my income as a result of it.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.960]   I was going to say I have mostly done traditional financing, but banks won't lend you money
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.520]   after you have 10 properties.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   And so as a result of having the maximum amount of properties, I've now started doing a lot
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.040]   of some seller finance deals.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.000]   Are your properties similar in nature, all townhouses, all single family houses?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.440]   The first few I purchased were similar in nature.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.720]   They were pretty much all townhouses in a particular area.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.760]   And then I started to branch out.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.240]   The last few I purchased, I purchased a couple of single families, which I turned into duplexes
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.640]   by renting the basements.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:14.680]   And I started purchasing a couple of rural houses a few years ago.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.160]   My most recent acquisition was a quadruplex.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.880]   And I now have a sixplex on the contract.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.000]   So I think I'm now moving towards multifamily.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.960]   Why?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.240]   Because they are less risky in some ways.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:40.760]   And what I mean by that is, if I have a single family that's rented for $1,500 a month, when
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.880]   that tenant moves out, I'm out $1,500 a month, right?
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.680]   Like I'm out the whole amount.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.080]   And that property could be empty for a couple of months.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.880]   If I have a quadruplex, and I'm getting $2,000 a month with each tenant paying $500 a piece,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.720]   if I lose a tenant, I'm still getting most of the income.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:07.140]   And so I think it's been a way to minimize risk from vacancies.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.800]   You really take a big hit from single families when tenants move out.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.840]   I think the flip side, though, is that if you purchase right and in a good market, there's
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:22.080]   a lot more, I think, appreciation if you purchase right.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.800]   Whereas where I'm purchasing my multifamilies, they're pretty much cashflow markets.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.600]   I don't expect to make a lot in terms of equity.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.800]   But I expect to have low turnover and to always be able to cashflow because I'm not relying
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:42.600]   on one or just two tenants to pay the mortgage on them.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.840]   You're looking forward to proclaiming yourself financially independent within the next couple
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.840]   of years.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.800]   What's your definition of financial independence?
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.960]   Oh, gosh, Joshua.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.560]   I actually read your definition.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.160]   I love it.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.720]   My definition is to be able to…
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.820]   I'll talk first from a financial perspective and maybe secondly about a lifestyle perspective.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:19.280]   But financially for me, it's having enough passive income to cover my mortgages, utilities,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.460]   transportation, insurance, food, and basic entertainment.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.640]   If I can get that, I have to calculate what would that cost?
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.980]   How much would I need to earn a passive income for all of those costs to be covered?
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.880]   And that number is my financial freedom number.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.200]   I think that's sort of from a financial perspective.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.480]   Are you willing to share that number?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.680]   Yeah, sure.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.840]   My current number, which I think is on the higher side, is $7,000 a month.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.120]   I could do it with less, but I'd rather overestimate.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.440]   I also house hack.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:02.080]   What I mean by that is that I have tenants paying my mortgage in full each month.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.540]   So I could technically not include my mortgage in that number and it would make it $5,000.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.400]   So we'll come back to house hacking in a moment because I know this is important to you.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.420]   But continue the theme that you were on about the financial definition.
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.480]   Now go on to the next thing you were going to say.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.560]   I think the other part of this is the lifestyle definition from a financial independence part
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:29.360]   is probably what excites me the most because I started working at age 15.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.640]   And so I feel like I've already been working for almost 25 years.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.460]   And I've always had to wake up to do what is expected of me.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.780]   And it's not always been the way I spend my days isn't the way I would spend them if I
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.780]   were doing my own thing.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.280]   If I had my own business, if I were able to choose how I wanted to spend my time, it wouldn't
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.520]   be the way I spend my time now.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.460]   And that doesn't mean that I wouldn't want to work in the inner city and help kids and
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.460]   help leaders.
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.460]   It doesn't mean that.
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.280]   I think it means I may not want to do it for 12 hours today.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.380]   I only want to work three hours.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:08.940]   A lot of the freedom side of it from a lifestyle perspective is what is most attractive to
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.720]   me right now.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.480]   I have an 18 month old.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.320]   When he's three, and when I turn 40, he'll be three.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:26.660]   And I would love to be able to have the flexibility to travel more with him, not have the atypical
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:33.340]   lifestyle where he has to just, he's in daycare and I only see him for two hours when I get
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.340]   home.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:40.820]   I'd like to have richer, more diverse experiences with him before he starts school.
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.660]   So that's a big part of it for me.
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:51.220]   How do you, what's your approach toward handling and managing the 168 hours that you have in
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   a week?
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.220]   You've got a lot of balls in the air.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.700]   How do you approach it?
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.140]   It's so, oh my, it's so tremendously challenging.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.140]   So tremendously.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.980]   I'm out, I'm out.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.100]   I wasn't always good at this.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.900]   It's something I am actively working on because I, my role is very demanding.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.900]   I'm the second person in command after my boss for our organization.
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.300]   We have five schools and I manage three of the principals.
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.740]   So it's a pretty demanding role.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:29.540]   And I started just a few weeks ago, maybe a month ago, working with virtual assistants
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:35.460]   because I realized that there are certain procedural tasks that I don't need to do anymore
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.700]   that I've trained myself to do.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.140]   So that's one thing I'm doing differently.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.460]   I'm also increasingly accepting assistance from a variety of people.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.660]   As an educator, as a teacher, I was very frugal.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.100]   Teachers tend to be very frugal.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.420]   You make $30,000 a day, I mean, sorry, a year.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.420]   I'll take 30,000 a day.
[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   A day, that's great, right?
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:03.340]   In a year, and it's like, I have not met a teacher that is not frugal.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.780]   So I had to move away from that.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.660]   So I need, I have people come if I need my house cleaned, I don't have to do it myself.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.860]   If I need babysitting support on a weekend, I need to hire someone for it.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:22.100]   I am hiring out a lot more than I have in the past to get support with basic tasks.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.220]   Like I don't spend a whole bunch of time at the grocery store.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.220]   I use Amazon Prime.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.480]   I've tried to think through how I spend my time.
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.500]   And whenever I find that there's someone else who can do what I'm doing for less than I
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:41.740]   have, than I would cost to do it, then I'm going to, in most cases, have them do it instead.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.740]   In many cases.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.340]   And I think, so that's my strategy.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.820]   But even with that being said, I work tremendously hard.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.580]   I'm up at five in the morning.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.180]   I have my morning routine.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.980]   Then my son gets up around six.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.980]   I take him to daycare.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   I go to work.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:55.980]   I get back, he's in bed at eight.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.980]   And then I'm back at work from eight till ten.
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:04.140]   So it's still a very tight schedule to meet this goal.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.380]   When you were hiring, when you're talking about hiring virtual assistants to help you
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.820]   with your work, is that something that you're choosing to do out of your own pocket simply
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.100]   because it frees up your time?
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:19.580]   Or are you trying to convince your boss that this is an organizational move and the company
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.340]   needs to pay for it?
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:23.900]   Definitely not the latter.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.020]   I'm not trying to convince, no.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:30.460]   It's a move that I'm making to free up my time.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.700]   I can't even convince anyone right now.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.580]   It's just, if I have a project that I need to work on and I could find somebody else
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:43.660]   to do it for $4 an hour or $5 an hour, or do half of it for $5 an hour, and I do the
[00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.420]   analysis and the strategy piece of the task, that's where I'm going to go.
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:52.220]   I don't know if it would be recommended in my role at work.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.540]   I don't know what the org-wide stance is for me to do that.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:04.220]   But I know that for me to be effective in my job while building my financial freedom
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.920]   passive income business, I have to do it.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.420]   So I pay for it.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.180]   I pay for it.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.060]   It still works out, no matter what, I've always worked from home.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.740]   I've always worked around the clock as an educator and as an administrator.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:24.140]   So it doesn't, I mean, I guess it doesn't make a difference to me.
[00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:29.300]   I've never felt like I could just work and come home and not work more as an educator.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   We always bring work home.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.180]   So I don't feel like I had that leverage with my boss.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:40.860]   Do you, in looking at some of these changes that you had to consciously make to spend
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.020]   a little bit of money in order to be more productive, whether that's hiring a house
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:49.260]   cleaner or hiring a virtual assistant to help you with some of your work-related, your job-related
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.940]   tasks, do you get the sense that you're doing too little too late?
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.580]   Do you wish you'd done this earlier?
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.540]   Are you, do you wish you'd done it earlier?
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.940]   There's so much I wish I had done earlier.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.300]   So much.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.380]   That, absolutely.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.740]   I don't know why, if I could say to the audience, I don't know why we are, we are so resistant
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.740]   to change as humans.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.380]   I, there's, I've always been an avid reader.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.180]   I've read many, many financial books, many productivity books.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.380]   So it's not an intellectual issue.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.380]   And for most people, it isn't.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.180]   It's just actually taking action and doing it.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.460]   There's nothing I'm doing now that I haven't read about, that I didn't read about five,
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.300]   10 years ago, right?
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:43.980]   Like leveraging your time, outsourcing, taking bigger risks, all of that stuff, like getting
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.360]   rid of your limiting beliefs.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.940]   There's a lot that I think, and it probably was triggered by having my son, things that
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:57.500]   I always, that I knew that I wasn't doing either consistently enough, intensely enough,
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.100]   or aggressively enough that I am now doing, because I've given myself this timeframe.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.580]   I'm like 40.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:04.580]   I'm not kidding.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.580]   I've told everyone.
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.580]   No going back now.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:15.220]   I've even told my boss, told everyone, like, when I get to 40, two years from now, I will
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.220]   be financially free.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.180]   And I am currently working backwards from that number.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:27.100]   And that's, it's scary because everybody knows I've made that commitment.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:34.980]   But I think it's also been very inspirational or inspiring because I have to, I get up at
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:37.380]   five, I'm going for it.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.380]   I'm up late.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.300]   I'm more inclined to try new things.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.980]   I need a virtual assistant because I'm not able to write a real estate contract on a
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.860]   property because I have a project for my job.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.580]   And that means I'm not going to make my goals for this year, my passive income goals.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.940]   When I think about it that way, it's a no brainer.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:05.780]   Why and when and how did you start sharing your financial goals with others?
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.580]   You guys have great questions.
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.620]   Okay.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.460]   Why, when and how?
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.740]   Let's start with why.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:24.220]   I think I would say the why is that I like to help people.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:32.860]   I like to be around people who are driven and there are a lot of people around me who
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:39.580]   from my experience, either don't dream anymore or have entirely given up on their goals.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:44.580]   There's just no, it's not even in their schema that they could want something and go after
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:45.580]   it.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.580]   And it's very depressing.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.780]   It always, it always depresses me.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:56.340]   And so I started sharing what I was doing and why I was doing it as a way to, I would
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.420]   say in some ways kind of model that even if you don't make the goal, just have a purpose,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:12.500]   something you care about to show, to inspire, to support, to motivate all of those reasons.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:22.340]   And in terms of when, as an educator, I had to plan for my students.
[00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.860]   For them to learn to become great readers, great citizens, I had to plan every lesson
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.700]   for them for the entire year.
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:37.100]   As a principal, I had to write 20, 30 page strategic plans for my school, for my organization.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.160]   And I used to do that every winter.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:46.380]   And I'd say about four years ago, in the winter, I was like, "I'm writing a 30 page plan for
[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.380]   my job.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.380]   I don't even have a two page plan for my life."
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.260]   It's just like something hit me.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.180]   I think I was reading, it's either John Maxwell or Brian Tracy.
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.380]   I can't remember which one.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.420]   One of them has a book about goals that's really good.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.940]   And I don't remember the title right now.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.220]   - Brian Tracy has a book, it's called Goals.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:07.220]   That's the title of it.
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:09.980]   - Maybe that's a bad judgement.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.860]   I recall putting this book down in December, in the middle of my 20, 30 page strategic
[00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.100]   plan.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:21.900]   And just like this light bulb went off, I was like, "I don't have goals for my life,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.380]   but I have a 30 page strategic plan for my job."
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.300]   And I started writing my butt off.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.880]   That winter vacation, by the time I picked my head up, I had 10 pages with my vision
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   for my life.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.140]   And I still had that document, which I share today with my mastermind groups.
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.660]   And I wrote it and I kept reflecting on it.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:50.540]   And then the first year I was living it, but not as intensely as I'm living my vision now,
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.940]   but it definitely started that momentum for me.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:32:01.340]   And I think as a result of that, I started to have more consistent levels of success.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.060]   And I was like, "Holy crap, this stuff works."
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:10.300]   You know, at first I was like, the goal was buy three houses a year and read 15 books.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:16.060]   It was like some basic stuff, but the vision was big, but the goals were smaller.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:21.240]   And now I still have this pretty big vision, I think, for me, for my life, but my goals
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.420]   have gotten bigger.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.620]   So I'm gaining more traction towards them.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.020]   So the when is about four years ago.
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:34.740]   I think the why is so that everyone gets that we can do what we want to do.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.580]   It's not easy, but it's worth it.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.700]   And I think my how has always been through constant learning.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:46.140]   - Are you a handywoman?
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.140]   - In what ways?
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.820]   - Are you out there looking at your properties, walking on the roof, getting in there and
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.820]   fixing stuff?
[00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.660]   Or how do you handle, with the demands of your job, how do you handle the maintenance
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.580]   and repair needs of your investment portfolio?
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.580]   - Sure.
[00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.580]   Great.
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:07.180]   I'm not, I don't consider myself handy at all, nor do I like to be hands-on.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.700]   I like to leave things like that to the experts, people who are good at it, so that I can do
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.980]   what I do best and make more money that way.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.500]   The part of real estate that I enjoy is making the deal.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.620]   It's like doing the math, calculating the cash flow, the passive income streams, and
[00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.980]   like making sure it's a great deal.
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.540]   And I lock it up, I'm like, okay, I'm good.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.060]   Could somebody else manage it for me now?
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.580]   I'm not into doing that work.
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:37.980]   I have property managers for most of my properties, except for two, which I manage on my own.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.380]   They charge anywhere between 8% and 10%.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.820]   They take care of repairs.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.460]   They send me estimates first, which I approve.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.100]   They get the job done.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:53.960]   If tenants move out, they get the property to be rented for a fee, things like that.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:59.740]   If for me to be able to scale this by 40, I can't be doing handiwork.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.740]   I can't be that hands-on.
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.360]   It's not the best use of my time.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.220]   And I think I was more hands-on earlier in the game when I needed to learn it, which
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.100]   I think is helpful.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:17.380]   And when I also had more time, didn't have a child, I wasn't a principal, so earlier
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.300]   I was more involved.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.940]   But at this point, I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.500]   I think unless you're just starting out, I really wouldn't recommend, if you're trying
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.100]   to scale, doing so much of the work yourself if you're also doing a full-time job and a
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:38.780]   A few moments ago, you were talking about your schedule, and you said you get up at
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.860]   5 a.m. and you have a morning routine.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.700]   How do you mean that term, "morning routine"?
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:50.060]   Morning routine, I'm sure the Miracle Morning is a pretty popular book.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:56.460]   Hal Elrod, he has a huge following, read that book a few years ago.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:03.540]   It outlines what he calls "savers," which are six things to do every morning to prepare
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.460]   yourself for a successful day.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:11.260]   I actually had a really, really difficult pregnancy with my son and found that book
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.780]   at a really good time.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:18.660]   And I say to my sister, jokingly, if it wasn't for the morning routine, God help how it showed
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   up in this world.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.980]   People would not like me.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:30.100]   But it consists of the S is for scribing, so journaling for a few minutes each morning,
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:38.460]   sharing gratitude, things like that, affirmations, visualizing your goals, exercising is the
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.380]   E. R is reading.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:47.140]   And then the second S is silence, which for me is meditation.
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:51.100]   And so it's either spending a minute on each letter, five minutes on each, ten minutes
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   on each, it depends.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:59.460]   I don't get all six of them in every morning, but what I do as much as I can is, my gratitude
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.060]   journal is really important.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.860]   I do that every morning.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.820]   I read my goals.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:09.940]   So I start my day with revisiting my goals for the year, as well as how I break them
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.100]   down into monthly goals.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.940]   Very helpful because sometimes I forget.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:18.140]   I'm like, oh, I said I was going to do this this month, but I'm behind.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:24.340]   Like for the month of April, I have like, my year long goal is to do something special
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.260]   for my parents every month.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.140]   So it's April, I'm like, wow, you know, I haven't done anything for my parents yet.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.940]   I need to go get that done.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.740]   You know, we forget.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.500]   I typically recently have not gotten exercise in, which is something I'm working on.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.700]   It really bothers me.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.340]   When I don't, I try to get that in in the evening.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.500]   I'm an avid reader.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.060]   So as a part of my morning routine, I'll read something uplifting or one of my books for
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.740]   the month that I'm reading.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:56.620]   And then I just, then I start my day feeling like I've invested in myself.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.700]   I'm clear what my goals are for the day and my intentions.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.580]   And I just, it feels more purposeful.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.220]   Let's go back to house hacking.
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.140]   I know you've mentioned this word a couple times.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.340]   Tell us what house hacking is and some of the different ways you've employed this concept
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   throughout your career.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:23.260]   I'm doing this a lot more than I have in the past, I think, or a lot more effectively.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:31.180]   It's really leveraging your home as a way to, I would say it's similar to Robert Kiyosaki,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.500]   Rich Dad, Poor Dad author always says, you know, your house is not an asset.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.660]   Everyone in America thinks that you own a home, you have an asset, but it's really a
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.660]   liability because it's debt.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:47.020]   It's debt that you have to pay back to a bank or to whoever.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.860]   House hacking is a way to turn your home into an asset because he's right.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.660]   You buy a property, now you have to pay $1,000 a month to people.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:00.060]   It's not really an asset unless there are people in your home who are paying your mortgage
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.740]   for you.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.420]   In that case, it's an asset because it's actually putting money into your pocket, especially
[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.820]   if what they're contributing is above and beyond what the monthly mortgage is.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:19.220]   So it's a way to leverage your home to create income.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.940]   I started, when I purchased my first home, my mortgage was $1,200, principal insurance,
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.960]   taxes, and interest.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.020]   And I remember saying to my brother, you have to move in with me because that's a whole
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.020]   lot of money.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.020]   So you paid $600 and I paid $600 a month.
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:41.380]   Now that I think about it, I guess I started my first home, I did have some income.
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.660]   It wasn't fully house hacking because I wasn't living rent free.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.820]   But the more I think about it, the more I realize that I've always tried to have at
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.620]   least one other person in the property with me helping me with the mortgage.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.060]   I've gotten really good at it now to the point where...
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:05.560]   So at the bottom of the market, it was 2012, in my area, the market dipped like 40%.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:13.980]   And I picked up a 4,100 square foot home that was, back in the days, it had sold for $600,000
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:17.540]   and I got it for $320,000.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.980]   And it's huge.
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.580]   So that's a lot of space.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:27.300]   It's six bedrooms, three and a half baths, three fully furnished levels, way more space
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.500]   than I could ever need.
[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:35.580]   And as a result of that, I literally live in this house where I have a tenant in my
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.260]   basement who pays $1,100 a month who I never see.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.540]   I can't even tell he lives here.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:46.380]   And then I have two other roommates who contribute another 1,000, which could be a lot more,
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.780]   but one is a really close friend of mine.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.440]   So he has a deal.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:56.180]   But essentially, I get to live here without paying for my mortgage because what they're
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:03.300]   contributing is above and beyond what my current mortgage payment is.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.340]   And in addition to that, it's awesome because they take the trash out and they help with
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.340]   babysitting and all that stuff.
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.340]   It's such a nice deal.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.340]   I love it.
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340]   Why doesn't everybody do this?
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:19.340]   Yeah, I've never understood many people's just desire to live alone.
[00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.100]   I don't get it.
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:27.260]   I get how somehow for some people it's somehow important, but it's different when you have
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.940]   a family as far as having people in the next bedroom.
[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.660]   There can be many more challenges.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.620]   But I'd rather live with people any day than live alone.
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:41.940]   And house hacking is a perfect way to do that and make it financially profitable as well.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.780]   As you just described, I think many people, if you just take a little thoughtfulness,
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:53.740]   can put together a deal wherein you buy the house and rent out enough rooms and you can
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:59.340]   either cut your costs substantially or even, as you just described, get to the point where
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.940]   you're making a profit on it.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.340]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.180]   It is absolutely.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:10.860]   And for me, when I wrote my vision for my life four years ago and I wrote out exactly
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.340]   what I wanted, I had envisioned the house I live in now.
[00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:18.620]   Because when we walked into this house, I was like, "Oh, the basement has three bedrooms
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.620]   and it has a bathroom."
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:25.060]   And there's something about having clear goals and knowing what you want that just really
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:26.140]   helps.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.700]   Because before moving into this house, I knew I'd be living rent-free, mortgage-free.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.980]   So this is a steal.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.580]   So I think it takes intentionality.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.420]   It's totally doable.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.340]   But it doesn't feel like I'm living with people.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.900]   I have a huge level to myself.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.860]   I mean, how much more space could we possibly want?
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.860]   Yeah, indeed.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:51.660]   But yeah, it's completely doable.
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:52.660]   Totally.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:42:00.500]   You've built this real estate portfolio by building off of the back of your employment
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.420]   income, which started off relatively low as a teacher and now as a professional, I'm sure,
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.420]   is at least middle income.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:13.780]   How has the financing process been along the way and what have you done that's allowed
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:19.900]   you to leverage a normal income into such a substantial portfolio with regard to your
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.180]   financing?
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:28.140]   As I mentioned earlier, the financing process when I just started was pretty easy.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:33.340]   Because back in 2006, you could get a loan even barely without having a job.
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:40.060]   So I think I got in, my first few properties I got in just because I had a stable income.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.060]   You're a teacher.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.540]   That's a stable job and I had good credit.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.420]   Pretty much was all it took.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.940]   My first couple of properties were, I still was smart about it.
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:54.500]   I would purchase for like 3% down, live in the property for a year or two, move out,
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   rent it, do it again.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.500]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:01.780]   So I was always able to get in with pretty low down payments.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.500]   Because you started with them as a primary residence, right?
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   Yes.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:12.860]   So I never needed the 10%, 20% down because I would always purchase as an owner-occupant.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.220]   Live there for a year or two, move.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.700]   Purchase again as owner-occupant.
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.380]   Live there for a year or two, move again.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:23.260]   So if you think about it, it's purchasing these properties with 3% down.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.260]   Let's say it's $150,000.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.860]   That's 3% down, it's like $5,000.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:34.500]   And then getting closing cost assistance from the sellers, you know, if possible.
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:39.460]   And I could save $5,000 as a teacher working in the summertime.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:47.500]   Or I could purchase the property because I'm a real estate agent and I have to, and I kind
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.980]   of have more of an inside scoop.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.820]   So to be able to leverage my real estate license to get better deals.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   That helped me out too.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:44:02.380]   So I could use my commission towards either the down payment or the closing cost or something.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.180]   Have you done that on all the properties that you've bought?
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.180]   Not all.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.420]   I did it a lot more earlier on.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:14.980]   I don't do it that much anymore because I'm priced out of my current market.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:20.540]   So I've started purchasing properties out of state.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:24.300]   Because again, I'm looking mostly for cash flow and my market is no longer the best,
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.420]   one of the best cash flow markets out there.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:34.540]   Last question, back to the theme of financial independence.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:40.420]   Have you wondered, and I know this is a legitimate question, not trying to insult your plan,
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:45.460]   but have you wondered with this aggressive goal of being financially independent at 40,
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.300]   have you wondered sometimes if it's all worth it?
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.420]   If you're not sacrificing too much now for the future?
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.580]   I wonder about it a lot.
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.100]   I think about it a lot.
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.140]   I also think that it's something important for me to think about because I'm such a future-oriented
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:03.140]   person.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.540]   I've read this book about that there are some people who are all, who are like, you're either
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.420]   present-oriented, future-oriented, or past-oriented.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:13.780]   And again, I forget the title, but I've always been future-oriented.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:18.340]   So that's a danger because it impacts one's ability to enjoy the present.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:24.220]   So I definitely want to check myself because I don't want to create this illusion that
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:29.940]   something will magically happen at 40, I become financially free, and life is perfect forever,
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.940]   right?
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.280]   Life will always have challenges.
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.040]   There are no guarantees.
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:42.900]   And so I try to keep myself grounded and remind myself of that by not thinking that I'm not
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.500]   in search of this perfect life at 40.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:52.420]   I am in search of freedom at 40 to not go sit on a beach and sip margaritas.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.500]   That is not my goal.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:56.940]   I will continue to work.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:06.460]   I think what, I would say the reason I'm not as concerned nowadays as I used to be is that
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:12.020]   I don't actually have the illusion that I'm going to be like 40, financially free, and
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.620]   never have problems and just sit at home.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:24.780]   I have a purpose, and I see my purpose as figuring this out for myself because there
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:30.940]   are millions of people who have no idea how to do this at all.
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.340]   And it is not dissimilar from my purpose in helping kids in the inner city.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.020]   It doesn't feel that much different to me.
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.820]   It's different content.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.100]   But I think education helped to get me out of poverty, and I wanted to help kids get
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.740]   out of poverty living in inner cities, so I decided to teach.
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:55.140]   Financial awareness helps adults get out of poverty, and I really want to and need to
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:56.500]   help.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:02.180]   It's similar, it's the same calling, so different content, maybe different audience, but I would
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:10.420]   like to do that on my own terms, at my pace, with my time, from the location that I choose.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:15.580]   But it still works, and it's still a part of this bigger passion of helping others out
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:21.540]   who are in situations where that support is needed.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.540]   Dave: It does.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.500]   Nicole, this has been awesome.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.580]   Final thoughts, share with us anything you'd like to share, and also tell any listeners
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:35.220]   who'd like to find out more about the work that you're doing, get in touch with you.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.100]   Just share any final thoughts of encouragement or advice, and also any contact information
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.580]   you'd like to share, please.
[00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.580]   Sure.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:45.780]   I would say, first I want to thank you for this opportunity, Joshua.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:51.180]   It's talking about writing your goals down and having them come to fruition.
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.500]   This is an example of that.
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.460]   I listen to your show so much.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.340]   I would encourage people to do that.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:04.940]   There is so much free information nowadays, it is ridiculous.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:07.140]   There's so much out there that we could learn.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.180]   There are so many ways to think about this.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:14.860]   I've learned a lot from hearing how you think about financial freedom versus somebody else.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.940]   I encourage people to read, go to the library, it's free.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.180]   Listen to podcasts on your commute.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:27.580]   Seems like very generic advice, but it's so helpful.
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:38.740]   This also sounds kind of cliche and trite, but if we're not willing to dream anymore
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.740]   and have a purpose and find our purpose, whatever it may be, it's not clear.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:47.100]   Life just seems so meaningless.
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:52.220]   My encouragement to anyone out there would be to really think about your purpose.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:55.980]   If you don't know what it is, think about what you like to do or what you would like
[00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:56.980]   to do.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.980]   Whatever it may be.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.380]   Put a plan in place around it.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:06.220]   Because it actually, with a clear plan, things will start to happen.
[00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.220]   That's what has started to happen for me.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.980]   I recently started financial freedom masterminding.
[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.900]   I'm having a blast with it.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.260]   Surrounding yourself with like-minded people works.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.180]   I made a goal to do that this year.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:25.780]   Now I'm leading two masterminds as a result of it with awesome like-minded people.
[00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:39.980]   I can be found at facebook.com/financialfreedomlovers or via email at financialfreedomlover@gmail.com.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.700]   I just again want to thank you.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:42.940]   That's all I have to say.
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.940]   Just go after your dreams.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:49.500]   Mad Fientist: Nicole, thanks for sharing an inspiring story and continue to encourage
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.500]   others.
[00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:56.300]   I love to have educators on this show because it does seem my experience has also been similar.
[00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:01.660]   It seems like many people who go into teaching automatically assume that it's a sentence
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.220]   to a lifetime of poverty.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   And personally, I think it's a little bit silly.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:13.380]   Number one, as a teacher, you can make a ton of money if you approach it a little bit differently.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:22.060]   And oftentimes, there's a broken concept that somehow it's noble to not make money
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:26.140]   where I view money as simply a measure of the value that the marketplace puts on your
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:28.140]   work.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.700]   But the neat thing about your story is to demonstrate there are a lot of advantages
[00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.740]   of being a teacher.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:38.820]   And as you've been able to exploit some of those advantages, flexible schedule, stable
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:45.900]   income, summer's off and show how even within the context of teaching, it is possible to
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.100]   build financial freedom.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.820]   So keep preaching the message and helping other teachers do well because I'd love
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:56.780]   to have many more teachers teaching because it's something that they love to do rather
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:59.100]   than something they are forced to do.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.020]   Nicole Johnson: Yes, well said.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:02.020]   I completely agree.
[00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.020]   Mad Fientist: Great!
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.020]   Nicole Johnson: And I will.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.020]   Mad Fientist: Absolutely!
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:06.020]   Thank you, Nicole.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.020]   Nicole Johnson: Thank you so much.
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:08.020]   Have a good day.
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.020]   Mad Fientist: Thank you.
