[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   [music]
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:13.840]   We jolt awake, grab our phone, silence the alarm, and there, laying in bed, phone in
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.100]   hand, we face our first decision of the new day.
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.580]   Do we shut off the screen?
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.320]   Or do we start scrolling?
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.880]   I wanted to know how common this dilemma was among Christians.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   So back in April of 2015, I conducted an online survey of 8,000 readers of DesiringGod.org.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.600]   My survey focused on smartphones and social media habits.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.160]   I asked a bunch of questions and received a lot of revealing results in return, a few
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.440]   of which made it into my smartphone book.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   But here were three stats that immediately stood out to me.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.840]   Of the 8,000 respondents, half admitted to scrolling through their phones within the
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.760]   first minutes of waking up in the morning.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.960]   And this figure rose to over 60% among those aged 18 to 29.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.160]   And when asked whether they were more likely to scroll through texts and email and social
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:17.520]   media before or after their morning devotions, a staggering 73% admitted to me that they
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.640]   normally did so before spending time with God in the morning.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.600]   73%.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   And while scrolling social media may seem like a harmless indulgence, I think we all
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   know it's an unhealthy way to start the day.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.840]   It's like eating chocolate for breakfast.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   So I want to ask you, Pastor John, in light of these stats, what's a better approach in
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.600]   these moments just after we wake up in the morning?
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   I think there is a better course.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.520]   But to help everybody understand why I think that and what that better course is, it might
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.240]   be helpful to start by analyzing why we are so prone to click on our phones before we
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.880]   do almost anything else.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.640]   So I thought of six possible reasons why we do this.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.200]   And I got these reasons out of my head by analyzing John Piper's soul and his temptations.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000]   I haven't done any surveys, so if people think this is narrow, they say, "Well, yeah, it
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   is.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.160]   It comes out of me, and if people are like me, then they might get help."
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.660]   It seems to me that all of these six things, I'm going to say, are rooted in sin rather
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.880]   than rooted in the desire to serve others and savor God.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.560]   And I put it like that because I do think the great commandment does set the agenda
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.240]   for our mornings and our midday and our evening.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   We are to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind, strength when we wake up in the
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.760]   morning.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.120]   And we are to prepare ourselves to love our neighbor, serve our neighbor as ourselves.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.960]   And given how sinful John Piper is, and I presume others are like me, very few of us
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   wake up with our whole soul spring-loaded to love God and love people.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.140]   This takes some refocusing, to put it mildly.
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.480]   This takes some focusing of our souls by means of the Word of God and prayer.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.960]   We have to remind ourselves about reality in the morning in order to begin to love God
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.820]   and love people the way we ought.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:46.040]   So here are my six guesses for why so many of us are drawn almost addictively to consult
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.080]   with our phones or devices when we wake up in the morning.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.240]   And the first three I call candy motives, and the second three I call avoidance motives.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:06.760]   So first, I think we love to immediately take a bite of candy from our phones for our novelty
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.880]   hunger.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Call this novelty candy.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.280]   We simply love to hear what's new in the world or among our friends.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.020]   What has happened since the last time we glanced at the world?
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.920]   Most of us like to be the first one to know something, and then we don't have to assume
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.100]   the humble posture of being told something that's smart and savvy and on-the-ball people
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.640]   already know, unlike us who didn't know.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.920]   And so we want to be quick and have knowledge of what's new in the world, and maybe we can
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.540]   assume the role of being the informer rather than the poor, benighted people that need
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.620]   to be informed about what happened.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.060]   And if they were smart enough, they would have been on their social media earlier.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.320]   So there's a big ego trip, I think, in our novelty hunger.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:04.300]   Second, I think we love to immediately take a bite out of our candy for ego hunger.
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.160]   Candy phone for ego hunger.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.320]   What have people said about us since the last time we checked?
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.680]   Who has taken note of us?
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.960]   Who has retweeted us or mentioned us or liked us or followed us?
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:31.080]   In our fallen sinful condition, there is an inordinate enjoyment of the human ego being
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.320]   attended to.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.460]   Some of us are weak enough, wounded enough, fragile enough, insecure enough that any little
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.760]   mention of us just feels so good.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.760]   It's like somebody kissed us.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.760]   Third, I think we love to immediately take a bite out of our candy for our entertainment
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.180]   hunger.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.320]   So this is entertainment candy.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.880]   There is on the internet, as we've all come to know, an endless stream of fascinating,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:12.140]   weird, strange, wonderful, shocking, spellbinding, cute pictures and quotes and videos and stories
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.600]   and links.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.700]   And many of us have gotten to the point where we're almost addicted to the need of something
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.080]   striking and bizarre and extraordinary and amazing.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.960]   So at least those three candy motives, I think, are at work as we wake up in the morning and
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.520]   have these cravings that we satisfy with our phones.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.720]   Then there are these three avoidance motives.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.760]   In other words, these aren't positive desires for something.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.240]   These are facing things in life that we simply want to avoid for another five minutes.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.560]   First, I would call it the boredom avoidance.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.000]   We wake up in the morning, we find that the day in front of us simply looks boring.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.200]   It feels boring.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.480]   There's nothing exciting about coming in our day and little incentive to get out of bed.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.440]   And of course, the human soul hates a vacuum.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.720]   And if there's nothing significant and positive and hopeful in front of us to fill the hope-shaped
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.840]   place in our souls, then we're going to use our phones perhaps quickly to fill that hole
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.240]   and avoid having to step into all that boredom.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.960]   Second, there is the responsibility avoidance.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.280]   We have a role, father, mother, boss, whatever.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.760]   There are burdens that are coming to us in the day that are fairly weighty.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.520]   The buck stops with us.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.880]   Many decisions have to be made about our children, house, the car, the finances, dozens of other
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   things.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.400]   Our life is full of weighty responsibilities and we feel inadequate for them.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.120]   And we're lying there in bed feeling fearful, maybe even resentful that people put so much
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.800]   pressure on us.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.040]   And we just are not attracted to this day at all.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.560]   And we would very happily avoid it for another five or ten minutes.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.760]   And there's the phone to help us do it.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.700]   And the third avoidance incentive is hardship avoidance.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.780]   You may be in a season of life where what you meet when you get out of bed is not just
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:31.700]   boredom and not just responsibility, but you meet mega relational conflict or issues of
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:38.840]   disease or disability in the home or friends who are against you or pain in your own body
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.800]   and your joints that you can barely get out of bed because it hurts so bad in the morning
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:50.400]   and it's just easier to lie there a little longer and the phone adds to the escape.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.360]   So those, Tony, are at least six of the things I thought of that are functioning probably
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.600]   in my incentive when I'm inclined to go there first before something else.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:08.620]   And there are pretty strong things that are keeping us in bed and keeping us on our devices.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.440]   But there is a better way.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.160]   And here's what points to the need for it.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.740]   What if you are the first one to the news and it is horrible news?
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:31.340]   Or what if your search for some ego candy finds ego acid and people have hated you overnight?
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:37.420]   And what if you spend five minutes getting yourself happily entertained in the morning
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.200]   rather than facing the responsibilities of the day immediately and you find at the end
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:50.220]   of those five minutes that they have drug you down into silly, demeaning, small-minded,
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.060]   hollow, immature frame of mind?
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.060]   Was it worth it?
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:03.020]   And what if you take five minutes to avoid the boredom and responsibility and hardship
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:10.220]   of the day only to find at the end of those five minutes of avoidance you are spiritually,
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:18.060]   morally, emotionally less able to cope with reality in the day than you were before?
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.400]   Was it worth it?
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.100]   So I think there is a better way to begin the day.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:30.540]   And it will require some decisions before the morning.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.540]   It never works to make last-minute efforts to decide to do something different.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.780]   You need to decide 12 hours earlier what this crisis moment is going to look like.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:42.500]   It will take some planning.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.660]   It will take some alarm clock thinking and setting.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.460]   What we want in the morning routine is to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:59.080]   We want something that gives us a zeal for the glory of Christ for the day's work.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.280]   We want to be strengthened to face whatever the day may bring.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.420]   We want something that gives us joyful courage to resolve, to count others better than ourselves,
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.460]   and pursue true greatness, like Jesus said, by becoming the servant of all.
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.400]   That's the real agenda in the morning.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:27.640]   Very few of us wake up strengthened to do all those glorious things that we get to join
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.560]   Jesus in doing.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.920]   So the new course for the morning, I think, is laid out in the Psalms.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.640]   And here's a key verse, Psalm 5.3.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.200]   "O Lord, in the morning you hear my voice.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:53.160]   In the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you, and I watch."
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.880]   So let the first thing out of your mouth in the morning, while you're still on the pillow,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.640]   let the first thing be a cry to God.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.200]   "I love you, Lord.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.440]   I need you, Lord.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.920]   Help me, Lord."
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.520]   That is the first cry out of my mouth in the morning.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.380]   "I need you again today."
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.280]   Then prepare a sacrifice and watch.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:27.560]   I think that sacrifice is my body and my attention devoted to him.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.360]   I watch for the Lord to show up and do what?
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.280]   What am I watching for?
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.080]   And Psalm 143 puts it like this, verse 8.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:44.480]   "Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.180]   Let me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul."
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:56.800]   So I'm looking, I'm on the lookout for the steadfast love of God, and I'm on the lookout
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.000]   for it in his Word.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.040]   And then Psalm 90, verse 14 tells me how to think about praying for it when it comes.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:17.640]   And just look for it and see it, and here it comes, but ask the Lord, "Oh, satisfy me
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.240]   with this steadfast love that I may rejoice and be glad in you all our days."
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:32.520]   So we watch in God's inspired Word for revelations of his steadfast love and his guidance for
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:41.600]   our lives and a profound sense of satisfaction in our souls that he is beautiful and that
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.000]   he cares for us.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.980]   Psalm 119, "My eyes are awake before the watches of the night that I may meditate on
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.160]   your promise."
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   Psalm 139, 17, "How precious to me are your thoughts, O God.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.180]   I awake and I am still with you."
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:12.640]   So I suggest that before you go to bed tonight, you make some choices and some plans and that
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:22.840]   you free yourself from the candy addictions and the habits of avoidance that have been
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:29.200]   ruining the strengthening potential for the beginning of the day.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.320]   Amen.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.860]   Let the first words out of our mouth while still on our pillow be a cry to God, "I need
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.220]   you again today, Lord."
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.880]   Thank you, Pastor John, for this reminder for this Better Way Forward.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.720]   And Pastor John is back with us next time as we look at Isaiah 65, 17.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.440]   Curious text about the new creation.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:54.100]   "For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth," declares the Lord, "and the former
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.120]   things shall not be remembered or come to mind."
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.120]   Interesting.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.280]   "The former things shall not be remembered or come to mind."
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.740]   So are we mind wiped in the new creation?
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.400]   Is the hard drive of our recollections of this life erased?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.240]   Thursday we'll ask Pastor John.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.280]   We'll see you then.
