[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060]   - Hello again, thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John
[00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.500]   with longtime author and pastor John Piper.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.160]   Before we launch into today's episode,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   I have a pretty important programming note for you.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.980]   As all of you know, or most of you know,
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John travels and he speaks a lot,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.080]   even internationally, and he also blocks off weeks
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.680]   in his annual calendar for the purpose of writing new books.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.480]   I'm really glad he does both of these things.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.200]   I'm sure you're really glad he does both of those things.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.040]   But it also means a good chunk of his time each year
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.240]   is bound up with those things.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.360]   And so seasonally, sometimes these priorities
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.480]   take away his time from other things like this podcast.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.080]   And in fact, after we record today's episode,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   Pastor John heads off to speak around Europe,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.280]   and then he returns to the States to finish writing
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.240]   a very important book on God's providence,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.780]   a book we've talked about before on the podcast,
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.840]   but one that looks back at all of the precious texts
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.520]   in the Bible that describe and celebrate
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.480]   the absolute sovereignty of God.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.520]   He's writing a whole book on the sovereignty of God.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.360]   It's a big book.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.180]   He started it last year.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.400]   He'll finish it this year.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.520]   I can't wait for this book.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.920]   I suspect it's gonna be one of those
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   really big landmark works that will define his legacy.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   But that means also he will not be back
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.140]   in the studio with me, again,
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.660]   until early September, it looks like.
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.500]   So two things.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.260]   Number one, pray for Pastor John Sommer.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.120]   He has a lot of really great work ahead of him.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.280]   And then second, that means that no new episodes
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.600]   will be published for about six weeks or so.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.140]   Until then, you can subscribe to the audio podcast,
[00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.840]   and what we're gonna do is replay
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.280]   some of your favorite episodes
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.260]   and some of our favorite episodes
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.840]   three times a week on the same publishing schedule.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   You'll get those not through YouTube or DesiringGod.org.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.040]   You'll get those through the audio feed,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.080]   so make sure you have an audio podcast
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.920]   and you're listening if you wanna hear those episodes.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   Again, three times per week we'll be doing that.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.260]   All right, but you're here today in the studio, Pastor John,
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.320]   and here's the question today.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.960]   It comes from a listener named Jordan.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.920]   Good afternoon, Pastor John.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.760]   I was listening to episode 1322.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.400]   What you said about the older brother jumped out at me.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.940]   The problem with the older brother
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.840]   is that he lived like a slave and not a son.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.720]   He related to his father as if his work
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.520]   would earn good things instead of enjoying
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.840]   the fellowship of the father's bounty.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.480]   That's a great principle pulled
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.880]   from Luke chapter 15, verses 17 to 24.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.000]   I often struggle with knowing in my heart
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080]   that no good work can ever be enough to please God,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   but thinking in my mind that God
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.680]   is surely not pleased enough with me.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   I fear I live like this older brother.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.260]   How do you live as a son and not a slave,
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.360]   and how would I know if I'm living as a slave?
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.360]   Okay, the first step in not living like a slave
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.440]   but like a son of God is to stop saying
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   mistaken slave-like things about our father.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.800]   Jesus said in John 15, 15,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.880]   "No longer do I call you slaves,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880]   "for the slave does not know what his master's doing,
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.120]   "but I have called you friends."
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.220]   And you could say sons as well.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.080]   Both pictures are in the New Testament,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.320]   and both are getting at the same reality,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.980]   but here the point is, "I've called you friends
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.580]   "for all that I heard from my father
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.620]   "I have made known to you."
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.620]   So one of the marks of a slave is we act like,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.720]   we live way out on the edge of the plantation
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.640]   in slave quarters where nobody knows
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.680]   what the master's plans are.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.960]   When you don't know what the master's plans are
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.200]   and how he does his business,
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.680]   you can easily say false things about him.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   So one of the first marks of a son or friend
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.000]   is that we know him.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.240]   We're brought in to his counsels.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.880]   We see how he works.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.940]   We see how he makes his decisions.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.560]   We see what he's up to.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.320]   We begin to understand his way
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.080]   and how he goes about running the world,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   and we stop saying things about him that are not true.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.880]   So Jordan, I love you, take this right.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.200]   Here's one step you can take
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.640]   away from slave-like relation to God.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.120]   Never say again what you said.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.840]   I often struggle with knowing,
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   knowing in my heart that no good work
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.280]   can ever be enough to please God.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.640]   Don't say that anymore.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.240]   Now I might be misunderstanding you, okay?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.760]   I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.040]   But it sounds like you really believe this,
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040]   like no good work can ever be enough to please God.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   That is slave talk.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.160]   That's not son talk.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.880]   So step one, don't believe that.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.920]   Don't say that anymore.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.280]   And I'm lingering on this
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.920]   because you're not the problem here.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.240]   Thousands of people have been taught to say that
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.680]   by quoting Isaiah 64 6.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.760]   We even sing it.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.960]   In the King James, it says,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.880]   we are all as an unclean thing
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.480]   and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.440]   Yes, how many Christians have been taught to say that
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.640]   about every one of their good deeds as a Christian?
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.960]   That's not, I'm gonna emphasize, read it in context.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.200]   That is not describing the good deeds
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.560]   of the genuine believer
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.320]   and his good deeds done in the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.640]   Those were the hypocritical religious acts
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.280]   that made God hold his nose.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.040]   When Jesus said, let your light shine
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.080]   that men may see your good deeds,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.720]   he did not mean that they may see your filthy rags.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.560]   He didn't.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.840]   When Paul says that Christians bear the fruit
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.440]   of the Holy Spirit, Holy, Holy, Holy Spirit,
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.720]   he did not mean that the Spirit produces filthy rags.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.000]   When Paul says Christ gave himself for us
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.680]   to purify for himself a people of his own possession
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.080]   who are zealous for good works,
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.640]   he didn't mean Christ died to create filthy rags.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.640]   What has happened in our grassroots theology,
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.560]   why this is, is that our zeal to clarify
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.600]   the pervasiveness of sin
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.680]   and the perfection of justification,
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.720]   we have undercut the Spirit's work in sanctification,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.240]   which is very real and very precious
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.040]   and should not be called filthy rags.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.560]   One of the ways we know we are the children of God
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   is that God has sent his Spirit to lead us, lead us,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   lead us, lead us into warfare with sin,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   lead us into paths of righteousness.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.240]   Here's Romans 8, 14.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   All who are led by the Spirit are sons of God.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.280]   For you did not receive the Spirit of slavery
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.840]   to fall back into fear,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.040]   but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.120]   by whom we cry, Abba, Father,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.240]   the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.280]   that we are the children of God.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.240]   And that witness, bearing witness
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   that we are the children of God,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240]   that witness that he bears,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   he's number one, by his power in us to work things
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.800]   that are no longer filthy rags.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.520]   That's witness number one.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   I am working in you to produce my fruit, not your filth.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.200]   Number two, to give us a sweet assurance
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000]   that we have an all-caring Father.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.560]   Abba, Abba, Father.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.960]   When that cry rises from the heart in childlike need,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.640]   it is the Spirit in us.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   So here's the key to a non-slave sonship relation with God.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.960]   Get to know God in his word.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.760]   You are no longer slaves who do not know
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.320]   what the Father's up to.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.400]   You are in the big house.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.240]   Your slavery is over.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.080]   You may walk into the Father's study at any time
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.320]   and interrupt him.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   His book is 1,200 pages long and full of gold and silver
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.200]   and honey for his children.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.940]   That's where you know him and meet him in his word.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.640]   Realize that because he gave his son,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.680]   your sins are forgiven.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.100]   And his Spirit enables you to please him.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.360]   Camilla, stop there 'cause you said,
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   you said you don't think you could ever do anything
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.580]   that pleases God.
[00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:31.760]   I could have misread what you said,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.920]   but that's what it sounded like,
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   and I want you to stop talking that way
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.740]   and thinking that way.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.560]   Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:9,
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.320]   "Whether we are at home or away,
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:46.040]   "we make it our aim to please him."
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.240]   He did not mean, and so our whole life is futile,
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.800]   aimless, pointless.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.840]   Christian life is a failure since nobody can do it.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.560]   He didn't mean that.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   He meant what he said in 2 Thessalonians 1:11,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.580]   "God fulfills every work of faith by his power
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:12.440]   "so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in us
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.420]   "according to the grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   Don't call that magnificent grace-based spirit-wrought work
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.080]   filthy rags and displeasing to the Lord.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.800]   Christ did not die just for our justification,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.920]   only for our justification.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.960]   He died for our sanctification.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.780]   He did not die just to remove the guilt of sin,
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.240]   but the power of sin as well now.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   Sons of God revel in forgiveness
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.040]   and trust the spirit of the Father to do good.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   And if there are imperfections in our spirit-empowered
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.180]   good deeds, which there are,
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.120]   that does not make them filthy rags.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.600]   They are the fruit of the Spirit,
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.920]   and our Father is pleased with them.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.400]   The day of perfection will come, oh, it will come.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.400]   But till then, God knows what he's working in his children.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.380]   Mark that.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.880]   God knows what he is working in his children,
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.480]   and he is pleased with what he is working.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.060]   Hebrews 13.21, I end with this.
[00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.920]   He is working in us that which is pleasing in his sight
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.360]   Amen, that's the way a son talks, not a slave.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.640]   - Amen, that's pure gold, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.960]   That's really a great place to end for the summer.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.600]   Many blessings to you, Pastor John,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   on your travels to Europe and on your final weeks
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.260]   writing your book on God's providence.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260]   And we are now going to break for six or seven weeks.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.540]   Please continue to pray for Pastor John this summer,
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.000]   and please continue to send us your questions.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.200]   We'll get all of those, so please keep sending those
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   in the summer, and we'll work through those questions
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.800]   in the fall.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.720]   And feel free, of course, to go back and listen
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.480]   to our 1,400 episodes that we've recorded
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.040]   and released to date in the archive.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.920]   You can do all of that.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.360]   Send us a question, listen to old episodes
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.720]   at our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.140]   And do remember to subscribe to the audio feed
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.160]   through our podcast app, and you'll be able to relive
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.000]   some of the best episodes we've released.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.440]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.500]   I am Tony Reineke, grateful to God for you,
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.080]   for the listeners, for donors who fund this podcast
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.920]   and who make our work possible.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.040]   We'll see you back here in six or seven weeks
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.000]   with new episodes.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.160]   (upbeat music)
