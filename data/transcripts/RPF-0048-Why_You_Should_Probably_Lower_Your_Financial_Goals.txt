[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.400]   1 o'clock a.m. Central Standard Time, 30,000 feet over Las Vegas. His friends, drunk, were asleep.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.880]   It was just the two of us now in first class. He extended his hand to introduce himself,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.760]   and an enormous, Looney Tunes enormous, diamond ring appeared from the ether as his fingers
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.960]   crossed under my reading light. Mark was a legitimate magnate. He had, at different times,
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.920]   run practically all the gas stations, convenience stores, and gambling in South Carolina. He
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.160]   confessed with a half smile that, in an average trip to Sin City, he and his fellow weekend
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:06.720]   warriors might lose an average of $500,000 to a million dollars each. Nice. He sat up in his seat
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.320]   as the conversation drifted to my travels, but I was more interested in his astounding record of
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.440]   printing money. "So, of all your businesses, which did you like the most?" The answer took less than
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.240]   a second of thought. "None of them." He explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.200]   he didn't like to buy things he didn't need. Life had become a succession of trophy wives.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.240]   He was on lucky number three, expensive cars, and other bragging rights. Mark was one of the
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:58.160]   living dead. This is exactly where we don't want to end up.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.960]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I thank you for being here. Today is episode
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.080]   48, and today is Tuesday, August 26, 2014.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:27.440]   Today's show is going to be all about why you should probably lower your financial goals.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:42.320]   I hope you're a little bit intrigued by my catchy title. I do my best to make these
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.560]   fun and interesting and thought-provoking and slightly catchy titles.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.800]   Probably not exactly the content that most people are accustomed to hearing and thinking of
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   for a financial and wealth-building podcast. I think it's a topic that we really need to explore.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:11.360]   That intro that I read was actually the first paragraph in Tim Ferriss' book,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   The Four-Hour Workweek, subtitled, "Escape the 9-to-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich."
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.480]   I thought Tim did an awesome job with that introduction. He's a very skilled writer.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.320]   In many ways, it paints the picture, not necessarily of the straw man. We don't need
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.880]   to have a straw man, but it does paint the picture of what I simply don't believe we don't want.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   I've read and still read a lot of success literature. I read a lot on wealth-building,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.960]   I read a lot of finance books, I read a lot on success, on personal success. Many times,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.400]   the primary focus of much of the literature that I read is on how to get more.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.840]   More money, more love, more health, more of everything.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.800]   Specifically thinking of how to get more money. It's generally assumed that more is always better.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.120]   Now, I personally think that's kind of a crazy thought. More is not always better.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.360]   There's a point at which enough is enough. I mean, consider, for example, food. Is more
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.560]   food always better? If you don't have enough food, you've sure got a problem.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.120]   But you want to have just the right amount of food. You don't necessarily always need more food.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.800]   The same thing, I think, with money is that having too little money is a major problem.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.200]   But more money is not necessarily always better. I was tempted to say that it's kind of a sign of
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.040]   psychopathy if you just always want more and more. And I went and looked up, you know, what are the
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.320]   clinical definitions of a psychopath? And it's not quite an appropriate use of the word,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.640]   but it's close. There's something wrong with people who are just greedy. They're filled
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:10.160]   with greed and avarice and just always wanting more. And I'm convinced that most of us probably
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.600]   already have enough and we can have enough. Now, I'll give you an example. I learned this
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.280]   personally by looking at people's incomes, doing financial planning. One of the things when I was
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.760]   doing active financial planning in the past, then I would always run what somebody's expected
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.120]   lifetime earnings would be based upon their current earnings amounts. So let's say that
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.560]   somebody's making $100,000 a year and they're 40 years old. I would take $100,000, I would grow it
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.440]   by an inflation rate of 3%, and then I would back it off to say the present value. And I would show
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.480]   them what the present value of their lifetime earnings is. And it's a huge number. No matter
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   how much money someone's earning. 20 grand a year over enough years is a pretty good size number.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.800]   And then I would always put that side by side with their balance sheet,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.560]   their current financial assets and their current financial liabilities and list them out.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.760]   And I would talk to them and I would say, "Do you see how if we just do the right stuff with this
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:21.040]   income that it's very feasible and possible for you to become wealthy and for you to achieve all
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.360]   of your personal financial goals?" Now, most of the clients that I would work with are at least
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.200]   middle to upper income. Generally, people of lower income are not usually sitting with a
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.280]   financial planner. Although they probably should be, but I haven't figured out how to
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.080]   do that. That's why the podcast is here. But in general, middle to upper income, if you look at
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   what someone's situation is, hey, they usually have a mortgage. Let's say it's a few hundred
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   thousand bucks. Maybe there's some other debt. And then we want to save a million,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.480]   couple million bucks. And you're looking at a two, three, four, five million dollar number.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:03.920]   Anybody can really do well financially. So why then would most of the financial plans that I
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.160]   prepared show somebody with massive shortfalls? And the reason it would show massive shortfalls
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.800]   is because in my experience, many clients are shooting for the moon. You know, say,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.480]   "How much money do you want to have?" And it's always a huge number. "How much income do you
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.320]   want?" "I want a hundred grand at retirement." "Well, what do you spend now?" "Forty-seven."
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.640]   "Why do you want a hundred grand? What are you going to do with a hundred thousand dollars?"
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.720]   People often don't think about it. And I don't know what the actual percentage of
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.520]   how often I would hear this, but basically, most people's financial goals are very, very high.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.400]   And I don't think many people have really thought about how high their financial goals
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   really need to be, because it's probably not as high as they're currently being set at.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.680]   Now, again, to be clear, I really think poverty stinks.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.880]   But even if you are poor, just thinking about how much it stinks doesn't help.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.720]   If you're poor, why not focus on appreciating the things about your life that are good,
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.600]   and then work like crazy to get out of poverty? And there's a balance there. So there is an amount
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.840]   at which we need to be, and then there's an amount at which it's enough.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   So here's something that I want you to remember that I constantly tell myself to,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.080]   because let me be frank. I am given to this. When I sit down and write a list of goals,
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.040]   I'm not the kind of person that sits down and says, "Lose 10 pounds." I'm the kind of person
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   that sits down and says, "I want a six-pack, and I want to complete an Ironman triathlon."
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.120]   "Well, Joshua, do you ever run?" "No, I don't like running." "Well, why would you sit that?
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.400]   Why would you set out an Ironman triathlon?" Because that's the big goal. Same thing financially.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.040]   It's not a matter of, "I just want to be comfortable. I want to be rich. I want to
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.520]   make a million bucks a year." "Well, do you need to make a million bucks a year?" "No, I don't."
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.440]   "So why do you want to make a million bucks a year?" Because that's a big number. That's the
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.560]   number that to me sounds like I'm doing well. But the problem is this. Getting rich requires a lot
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:17.760]   of work. It really does. For every goal, for every reward, there's a price. There's a cost.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.840]   And you have to pay the price before you get the reward. So if you're going to go after a goal,
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:31.600]   it better be worth the price. Really. My wife and I watched this last week, the movie,
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.160]   what was it called? It was called Don't Stop Believing, I think. And it was a movie about the
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:47.680]   Filipino singer that Journey, the band Journey, found on YouTube, the Filipino singer that they
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.560]   found to replace their lead singer after the previous singer wasn't able to continue working
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:58.000]   with them. They found this guy on YouTube. It's one of those really amazing stories. Here he is.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.240]   He's from the Philippines. He grew up extremely poor. He was a street child. His mother died when
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.120]   he was 13 years old and he took off on his own and he was living just on the streets of the
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.520]   Philippines. I've been to the Philippines and I promise you living on the streets of the Philippines
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:20.720]   is not, it's a challenge. It's nothing like living on the streets of the United States.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.920]   And he's just hand to mouth beggar, but he had a talent for singing. And so he sang and he built
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800]   this career and he built this over time. But I was struck by watching the interviews with these
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.640]   rock stars. And here you have mega rich, mega famous rock stars, the entire band Journey.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   But they were talking very transparently about the price that they paid to achieve their success.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:52.560]   Even Arnel was his name, the new band member. He talked about the price that he had paid to
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.080]   achieve his success. And in the documentary, I don't think the documentary was unfair,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:02.160]   but it certainly made it seem like more of a, I got the impression from the documentary
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.520]   that this guy was just singing in some random hotel bar and barely making it, had never
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.880]   been discovered as a singer. And they find his YouTube video and he's transported to stardom.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.280]   I went later and I researched, I just read his Wikipedia entry, and it was clear that he had
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.520]   been honing his craft for 25 years prior to the time that he was discovered. And he had gone through
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:31.120]   all kinds of work honing and developing his ability and his stage ability, and that was
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   when he got his break. And I've found with most of the overnight success stories, as a kind of a
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.760]   sidebar, most of the overnight success stories I've ever researched, they're not overnight
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.520]   successes at all. It's that somebody was working, working, working, working away at their craft,
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:50.320]   and then they had a break. There was something that happened and they were found and they had
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   a break. So back on track, the point is that for every effect that you want to have, you have to
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.880]   put in the cause. So if you want to get rich, getting rich is going to require a lot of work.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:09.920]   It's going to require earning money, saving money, deferring savings, deferring spending,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.600]   deferring gratification. There's a cost that you have to pay. And the higher you push that number,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   the bigger the cost. There is a much bigger cost. Let's use my running example.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.960]   If I'm going to decide I'm going to go out and run a 5K, I could do that today. There's not a very
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.240]   high cost, but there are a gazillion runners that run a 5K. If I decide, however, I'm going to go and
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.000]   run an ultra marathon, a 100-mile ultra marathon, that's a very small club, and there's going to be
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.200]   a dramatic cost that I have to pay to be able to achieve that. Well, the same thing with finance.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.680]   Getting rich is a lot of work. So let's make sure that the rewards are going to be worth making
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.080]   the sacrifice and paying the price. I think one of the most important steps on our
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.280]   list of goals should be to make a shopping list. So as we're developing our financial goals,
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.400]   which is where everything starts, what are the financial goals that are important to each of us?
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.640]   We really need to start by making a shopping list. What do you actually want to buy?
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:15.760]   On Friday, I did a show that was a Q&A, and the reader was talking about developing a certain
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.440]   level of retirement income. Or excuse me, the listener was talking about developing a certain
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.080]   level of retirement income. I'm constantly struck by how few people have any idea, when I've done
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.920]   retirement planning, how few people have any idea of an actual realistic budget of what they want to
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.720]   do in retirement. It was where I worked with all of my clients. The very first exercise of
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.280]   retirement planning is to sit down and create a budget, create a current. And what we would do,
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.240]   just I'll give this to you as a freebie, especially if you are close to retirement,
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:52.960]   this will be useful to you. What we would do is create basically four budgets. We have a current
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.120]   budget, and then we have a retirement budget. And then we have a minimum budget and an ideal budget.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.760]   And this is very important for retirement planning. So the current budget is,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:09.200]   here's what I'm currently doing. This is, excuse me, I misspoke. This would be usually three
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.360]   budgets, because it would be a current budget, and then it would be a retirement minimum budget,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.000]   and a retirement ideal budget. Although you can do minimum and ideal for now as well.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.920]   But usually most people are not that detail-oriented with their finance, with their
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.760]   personal finances. So I would start by saying, well, what's the minimum? What level of lifestyle
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.040]   is the minimum that you're willing to accept? You know, for example, do you eat out? Do you like to
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.640]   eat out at TGI Fridays, or do you like to eat out at Morton Steakhouse? There's a difference.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.400]   An Outback steak and a Morton Steakhouse is going to be a major difference. Do you want to eat out
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.080]   one time a week, or do you want to eat out four times a week? Do you want to, what would be an
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.080]   example, do you want to travel to Europe, or do you want to travel to South America? South America
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.440]   is a lot cheaper to get to than Europe. So we would start by making these budgets of what you
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.960]   would actually want. And then you would figure out, well, are we anywhere close? But the thing
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.120]   is, is that it's hard for people, especially if they're not tracking their money, to be able to
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.680]   know what those are. But usually what you would find is if you eliminated a lot of expenses,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.000]   that their budgets are actually fairly modest. This was a key takeaway if you've ever read the
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.560]   book "Your Money or Your Life," which is a highly recommended financial book. It's a key takeaway,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.560]   as they point out, that if you take away most of the expenses associated with working,
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.280]   in general, a lot of our goals are fairly modest. So the very first thing to do is to start with
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.120]   writing down your financial goals. On Friday's show, I mentioned John T. Reed's book, "How to
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.320]   Get Started in Real Estate Investment." And when I went and dug it off my bookshelf
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.640]   to answer that question, because I wanted to read that list of real estate strategies,
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:57.520]   I was flipping through it, and I was reminded of how I really had benefited from this book,
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:05.600]   and how he starts. Now, most get-rich books usually start with all the reasons why you should,
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:11.840]   you know, they're generally motivation. They're generally a pep talk about how great it is to be
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.760]   rich, and how you should just want a huge amount of money. One of the reasons why I have a huge
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:23.040]   degree of respect for John Reed is he starts his real estate book with this exact thing that I'm
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.160]   talking about. And I had forgotten he put it in here, and it was part of the genesis of my deciding
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.920]   to talk about this today, because this is where he starts. He says, "Start by setting your goals."
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.440]   And he tries really hard to talk you down from setting your goals too high.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.760]   He talks about what are the things that you're actually going to want to buy.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:50.080]   Make a shopping list is his thing. You can know that your finance author is actually probably
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.640]   someone worth reading if they'll start with trying to talk you out of wanting to be mega rich.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.680]   He starts with a shopping list, and he tells you what he thinks you should put on it. You know,
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.560]   he says, "You invest to make money. Wanting money implies that you have some shopping list of things
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.000]   that you cannot acquire until you get more money. Money is simply a means to an end. So exactly what
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.800]   is it that you want to buy?" And he goes on, he says, "You should want a nice house." He talks
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.560]   about how much that costs. "You should want an education for your kids." How much that costs,
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.520]   talks about college, talks about retirement, about what you should want versus not want,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.640]   and I'll skip that. But he makes some good points that I have made, and I had forgotten how much
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.800]   he and I were aligned with. I need to see if I can get him on the show. I'd forgotten how much
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.440]   he and I were aligned philosophically and how much I had learned from him in the past about
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.240]   that retirement is really just a dumb concept that, let me see here, he actually says, "People
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.680]   who are," he says, "I'm not interested in lying in a hammock. Generally, the only people who are
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.720]   are those who have not tried it. Absent some extraordinary luck, you would have to bust your
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.120]   butt for a long time to achieve the sort of net worth that would allow you to do so, to quit
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.200]   working. As a general rule, those who are capable of such butt-busting are incapable of such leisure."
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:14.240]   Much more eloquent way of saying it. But let me read one, these are the about five paragraphs,
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.440]   about eight paragraphs here that I wanted to read from this book. And there's two sections here.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.080]   And this is one of the points that I very have rarely have ever seen somebody talk about,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:30.160]   but I think is so important. Section is handled, "There are costs and risks to becoming rich."
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:36.640]   This is John T. Reed, "One reason I am trying to get you to have a realistic view of being rich
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.880]   is that getting there will require you to give up some important things, and it will require you to
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:49.040]   take risks. You should think twice before you give up those things and before you take significant
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.160]   risks. Another way in which millionaires and average people are the same is the number of
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:01.200]   hours in their day. Everybody gets only 24. Making extraordinary amounts of money requires spending
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.760]   extraordinary amounts of time. If you spend more time making money, you must spend less time on
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.520]   other things. To maintain your health, which is worth more than money, you must get a full night
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:20.560]   sleep, take time to eat healthy meals, and set aside some time to exercise. To maintain healthy
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.440]   family and friend relationships, which are also worth more than money, you must spend time with
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.960]   your family and friends. Every dollar you add to your financial goals takes more time away from
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:37.840]   important things like health, family, and friends. So I want you to set the lowest possible financial
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.760]   goal so you leave the maximum amount of time for things that are more important than making money.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.160]   I think it's good to want a good home and education for your kids. I believe you should sacrifice for
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.720]   those goals, but I cannot see sacrificing your health, family, or friends for goals like flashy
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:03.760]   cars, horses, boats, or private planes. If only I were rich, life would be a dream.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.360]   One mindset that disturbs me about beginning real estate investors is a naive belief that
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.160]   getting rich transports you to a state of nirvana. It does not. Those of us who have acquired the
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.360]   million are almost uniformly disappointed to find that money has a very limited ability to
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.440]   improve your life. I once had supper with billionaire Ross Perot in my capacity as co-president
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   of the New Enterprise Club at Harvard Business School. One of my friends told me to ask him,
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:40.480]   "Yes, but are you happy?" I did. His answer was, "Yes, I am happy, but I am not any happier than
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.240]   I was when my wife and I were newlyweds living in cramped, Navy-based quarters shortly after
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.680]   I graduated from Annapolis." He went on to say that being famously rich had some serious
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   disadvantages. For example, he had to train his children in kidnapping avoidance. He said if you
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.880]   asked his daughter if she were Cindy Perot or whatever her first name was, she would answer,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.400]   "No, she just left a few minutes ago." I also reject the notion that the rich are less happy
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.880]   than the average person. Money can buy happiness to an extent. The unhappiness of the rich that
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.000]   is related to their wealth comes from such things as getting divorced because one spouse spent too
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.320]   much time pursuing financial success and neglected family life. Also, many men tend to marry,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.120]   get rich, then conclude that not only do their first car and house need to be replaced with
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.040]   better models, so does their first wife. Although I have not experienced divorce firsthand,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.760]   it is clear to me from what I saw as a coach of divorced children that divorce provides a
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.440]   lifetime of agonizing unhappiness to those it touches. To the extent that the rich engage in
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.360]   dangerous hobbies, they may increase their family's unhappiness if they are seriously injured (e.g.,
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.040]   Christopher Reeve jumping horses) or killed (e.g., John Denver flying his own experimental
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.080]   plane that was purchased to enable him to travel more easily to visit his divorced children).
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.640]   Maybe it's a distortion caused by disproportionate media coverage,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.800]   but the children of the rich seem to turn out worse than the children of the middle class on
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.240]   average. The rich have more ability to spoil their children, and in that case the word "spoil"
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.440]   reflects not only the way the adults behave toward the children, but also the way many of
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.960]   those children turn out as adults. I know a number of rich people whose adult children are dependent,
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.080]   divorced, and living with and off their elderly parents. The children of the middle class may
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.920]   want to do likewise, but it is not an option. Extraordinary wealth can beget extraordinary
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.800]   laziness and lack of ambition in the children of the wealthy. What a horrible turn of events
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.840]   if the parents sacrificed their whole lives to give their children a better life than they had,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.040]   only to see those children respond by becoming leeches.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:00.800]   That's an excerpt from about three-quarters of a page of John Reed's book here, and
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.960]   hopefully that'll give you a sense of the whole book. It's well worth reading. Highly
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.520]   recommended buying it. But he goes on and he talks about his experience in real estate,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:15.280]   and he talks about how one of his goals as a young man was to have a $5 million net worth
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.680]   and to own 100 residential real estate units. And so he traded up. He says, "In pursuit of those
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.560]   goals, I became a millionaire, then a former millionaire." He traded up from 20 units to 37,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.920]   then from 37 to 58, and then he got sunk by the values of his properties being destroyed by the
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:39.280]   Tax Reform Act of 1986, the oil glut, and the overbuilding caused by the savings and loan
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.920]   debacle, and he lost three-quarters of a million dollars. He just talks about if he'd stopped when
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:49.680]   he had got his first 20 units in New Jersey, he would have been set for life. But he continued
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:55.360]   pursuing a higher number, and his wealth was destroyed. "Thinking back on it, all I can figure
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.640]   is that I picked the 5 million and 100 unit goals because they were impressive round numbers. I
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.280]   guess I figured that I would impress my friends and relatives and make my enemies envious."
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:20.160]   You've never read that in a success book, have you? Or heard that in a financial podcast. But
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.320]   he makes a good point, and he's coming from a position far beyond where I'm at. I'm just at the
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.840]   very beginning stages of my wealth building. But I've seen this, and I've noticed that this happens
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:37.040]   often. If you just moderate your goals a little bit, you lower your risk substantially. So a good
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.480]   place to start is make a shopping list and figure out what do you actually want. So example, like
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.960]   he said, you probably want a nice house. So sit down and figure out what does that mean? What
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.240]   kind of house is a nice house? Do you want it where you are? Education costs. I've got a whole
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:59.760]   series of shows planned on education, but how much does the education that you envision for your
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.240]   children cost? Incidentally, my opinion is you could probably get far better results if you'll
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.040]   free up your time and you spend time educating your children and not hiring it done, and it'll
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.520]   be better all around. But that's a rabbit trail for another day. Do you want to go out to eat? Do
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.200]   you want to drive fancy cars? I mean, what do you want? I would encourage you, in addition to
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.880]   the book that I just referenced, and all these books will be in the show notes,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.680]   I would encourage you to read the book, "Stop Acting Rich" by Tom Stanley. And Tom Stanley is
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.800]   one of my favorite researchers because he actually has quantitative data to pull from with regards to
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:47.600]   the wealthy and what they actually do and how they actually live their lives. I'm going to read an
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.640]   excerpt from the book here, and this is from his chapter called "The Road to Happiness," where he
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:26:02.000]   talks about what the wealthy drive, and he gives a little bit of a story. But consider this very
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.640]   practical way of thinking, and remember the fact that this is by someone who has made his life's
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.200]   work the study of the affluent and their habits and their lifestyles. Incidentally, one of the
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.600]   reasons why I like this book so much is because he talks about the affluent and what he labels
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:28.880]   the "glittering rich," and it really helps, those words really help me a lot to specify the
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.920]   difference between those people who are actually rich but seem like the millionaire next door,
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.680]   which was one of his books, and those adults who are just glittering rich, who are so rich that
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.720]   they can't possibly overspend their money. And I'll come to an example of that in a moment when
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.240]   I read an excerpt from another book as to what your budgets would look like if you had varying
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.800]   levels of wealth. Here's from chapter 7 of Tom Stanley's book. This chapter is called "The Road
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.560]   to Happiness." Tony D. of the Washington Speakers Bureau called me shortly after my first book,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.920]   "Marketing to the Affluent," was selected by the Best of Business as a top 10 business book.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.680]   He had two questions for me. First, would I speak at two of BMW's North American dealers'
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:22.960]   conferences? And second, if I preferred to be paid in BMW currency, the use of a BMW for a year,
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   or in U.S. dollars? No doubt BMW thought, or hoped, that I would be thrilled to drive a BMW.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:36.240]   Perhaps they were surprised when I opted to be paid in cash. Why did I go for the dollars and
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:43.680]   not the barter deal? Several reasons. Driving a BMW would make me uneasy. It is at odds with my
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.640]   family's consumption patterns and beliefs. It could also have proven a slippery slope.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.840]   Drive a car for a year, and the next thing you know I just have to have one that I would have
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:28:00.000]   to pay for, which would be harmful to my wealth. Most important, I know what a car can and cannot
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.240]   do for a person. You can't drive your way to happiness. Yet some people believe otherwise.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.840]   They may see some fellow driving a fully accessorized BMW, Corvette, or Cadillac,
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:17.600]   and assume something about him. They whisper to themselves, "There goes a happy guy. If I had that
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:23.440]   car instead of my Toyota, I would be off the far end of the happy scale." But just what is the
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.720]   relationship between the car you drive and your level of satisfaction with life? Well, according
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   to my research, there is no significant correlation between the make, or brand, of the motor vehicle
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.040]   you drive and your level of happiness with life. People who live below their means understand this.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.800]   The data tell the story. Consider the results from my most recent national survey of high-income
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:55.760]   producing households. Each of the 1,594 respondents was asked about the make of motor vehicles he had
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.400]   acquired over the prior ten years, as well as his most recent acquisitions. Guess what? Not one
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.200]   significant correlation was found between the make of motor vehicle acquired and overall
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   satisfaction with life. That's right. Not one of the 46 makes studied had any measurable effect
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:21.040]   on satisfaction with life overall. It did not matter what measure of motor vehicle acquisition
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.640]   habit was studied. The results were the same. For example, those who bought and/or leased one,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:32.640]   two, three, four, five, or more BMWs over a ten-year period were not significantly more
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.560]   satisfied with life than those who did not acquire any BMWs at all. And the same applies
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.760]   to all the other makes studied. Independent of make, what is the relationship between the price
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:50.000]   paid for an automobile and overall satisfaction with life? There is a positive, but not
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.080]   statistically significant correlation. I have my own personal version of the happy story.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:04.560]   An ABC 2020 program producer called to ask me a number of questions in preparation for my
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:11.840]   appearance on the show. She asked, "Why does a best-selling author drive a 2005 Toyota 4Runner
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.200]   and not a new BMW?" The answer to this question is simple. My son bought my '97 4Runner, so I had to
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.520]   get a newer car. More to the point, I would not be any happier driving a BMW. In fact, I would
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.640]   probably be less content if it cost $10,000 or $20,000 more than the $30,000 I paid for my
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   four-wheel-drive, sports-edition 4Runner. And then there are the additional carry costs. It costs more
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:46.640]   to insure a BMW than a Toyota. After the 2020 interview was over, I did some additional
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.480]   calculations. From my survey data of high-income producers, I computed the average level of
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:58.000]   satisfaction with life overall by the make of motor vehicle most recently acquired. Those
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   currently driving BMWs had an average level of satisfaction of 4.25 on a 5-point scale,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.840]   5 being the highest. Those driving Toyotas had an average of 4.20. While there is a difference,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.560]   1/20 of 1 point on the happy scale, it is not statistically significant.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:23.840]   Yet some difference was expected, given the fact that 71% of the BMW drivers who were surveyed had
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:30.160]   household annual incomes of $200,000 or more. In contrast, only 46% of the Toyota drivers
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.920]   generated this much income. My surveys indicate that there is a significant correlation between
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.680]   income and satisfaction with life. In other words, earning more money may make you somewhat happier,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.080]   but spending that money, particularly on cars, won't. If we make the appropriate statistical
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.040]   adjustments for income differences in life satisfaction, then we find that the average
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.720]   life satisfaction among Toyota drivers is higher. But surely I could afford to drive the dressed-up
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:06.000]   version of my Toyota 4Runner, a GX470 Lexus. Yes, I can afford a Lexus. However, I prefer
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   to allocate the extra $20,000 to conducting another survey of millionaires, rather than to
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:16.560]   ride around with the money in traffic. Is anyone happy in traffic, irrespective of the price and
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.560]   make of the wheel they are gripping? Not only is the V6 engine in my Toyota 100 pounds lighter and
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.480]   more efficient, and provides superior acceleration than the V8 in the gilded version, by allocating
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:34.720]   the $20,000 to the car, the money is lost forever, but by allocating it to a survey, it will generate
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:41.600]   more income for me. The Lexus does have better paint, my Toyota has orange peel, a superior
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.360]   transmission, and a higher quality interior, but are those attributes worth the extra $20,000?
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   Not to me. Most of all, the people who are an important part of my life do not care if I drive
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.520]   a Toyota. Nor does my choice of motor vehicle have any influence on the number of people
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.120]   who respond to my surveys or buy my books. Most people who are economically successful
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:11.360]   in objective terms do not need status brands to convince themselves or others in their social
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:17.200]   circles of this fact. Nor is their high level of satisfaction in life based on the make of
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:27.920]   vehicle they drive. To me, I think it's a good example of a rational way of thinking through
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:38.640]   a buying decision. And here's the key. You're a fool if you're caught up in the game of impressing
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:45.280]   other people. Now, I thought carefully about saying you're a fool, and maybe that's a little
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:53.440]   judgmental. Maybe I should say it is foolish, but really, it's--I guess I should temper it a little
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:34:00.080]   bit. It's completely foolish to be caught up in the game of impressing other people. Get your ego
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:08.480]   out of your finances. Seriously. Now, there is a place to consider something like image. There is
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.600]   a place to consider something like signaling theory, where the car that you drive needs to
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.880]   signal something as an aspect of our modern life. There is a place for that. But be careful.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:30.480]   Because the majority of times, those signals come into play. People are trying to signal
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:41.680]   something that's a complete lie. Don't be foolish. Get your ego out of your financial decisions,
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:47.280]   especially in the realm of cars. So my major point is though--with this is not to get off on that
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:56.720]   tangent--but my major point is that planning to buy a BMW adds--let's assume that you plan to buy
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.480]   a BMW. And let's say that you're carrying costs of buying a BMW versus a Toyota are an extra,
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.360]   conservatively, let's say $5,000 a year. Well, if we were to--let's use the--and
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.040]   where I'm bringing that number from is I'm assuming that you're driving a standard amount.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.520]   Now with a BMW, you're using premium fuel instead of regular fuel. You're paying a higher insurance
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.000]   cost. You're paying higher money because now you've got to put on high-performance tires
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.280]   instead of standard automobile tires. An extra cost. I'm making that number completely up.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.520]   Just--it could be certainly valuable--extra depreciation for the additional cost of the
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.680]   vehicle, et cetera. I made the number up off the top of my head. My point is that there could be
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.720]   a number of reasons why that number is accurate or it could not be. So don't get hung up on the
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:52.320]   number. So you're paying an extra $5,000 a year for the BMW. Well, in order to support an extra
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.160]   $5,000 per year, if we just use the 4% rule as a reasonable proxy for how much capital we would
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.720]   need to accumulate towards a retirement goal or a financial independence goal, we need to
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:14.160]   accumulate $125,000 of additional capital. So then stop and figure out, "Well, how long does it take
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.440]   me to save $125,000 or how would I have to invest to earn that $125,000?"
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:29.600]   It's probably easier just to adjust your tastes and lower the risk and simply choose that the
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:36.560]   BMW is not as important than just to choose the Toyota. It will remove a lot of risk out of your
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:45.040]   life. Even the whole retirement plan, frankly, as I've discussed in detail on the show many times,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:51.280]   there's a big difference between being prudent and saying, "I'm going to plan for a point in my old
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:59.760]   age and a point in my time at which I'm too infirm to work versus I'm going to plan to save a bunch
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   of money to retire at 65 to live the good life." There are so many problems with that plan. I mean,
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.360]   they're just all over the place. The majority of people, A, are never getting there, as I've
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.920]   proven in the past. The majority of people, B, don't want to get there. And the amount of work
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:20.560]   it takes to accumulate that much money in savings is massive as compared to so many of the other
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   options that are available. I suggest to you that you consider if money is really going to solve the
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:39.280]   problem or not. I'm going to read another excerpt here. This is again from the 4-Hour Workweek,
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.800]   Tim Ferriss' book. This is a page and a half here. "Money alone is not the solution. There is much to
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   be said for the power of money as currency. I'm a fan myself. But adding more of it just isn't the
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:59.440]   answer as often as we'd like to think. In part, it's laziness. If only I had more money is the
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:05.680]   easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:13.600]   enjoyment now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming routine,
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.760]   we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise."
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.920]   Well, John, I'd love to talk about the gaping void I feel in my life,
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.560]   the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start my computer in the morning,
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:31.280]   but I have so much work to do. I've got at least three hours of unimportant email to reply to
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:37.360]   before calling the prospects who said no yesterday. Gotta run! "Busy yourself with the routine of the
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:43.760]   money wheel. Pretend it's the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:50.160]   that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it's all an illusion,
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.960]   but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it's easy to forget.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:02.720]   The problem is more than money. Relative income is more important than absolute income.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.920]   Among dieticians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:13.760]   Is a calorie a calorie, much like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.040]   calories than you consume, or is the source of those calories important? Based on work with
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:25.120]   top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter. What about income? Is a dollar a dollar? Is a
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.720]   dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The new rich don't think so. Let's look at this like a fifth-grade
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.080]   math problem. Two hard-working chaps are headed toward each other, chap A moving at 80 hours per
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:41.920]   week and chap B moving at 10 hours per week. They both make $50,000 per year. Who will be richer
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.600]   when they pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would be correct. And this is
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   the difference between absolute and relative income. Absolute income is measured using one
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:02.480]   holy and inalterable variable, the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:09.360]   year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year. Relative income uses two
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:16.320]   variables, the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole per-year concept is arbitrary and makes it
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:25.360]   easy to trick yourself. Let's look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:32.160]   for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.640]   In relative income, John is four times richer. Of course, relative income has to add up to the
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I make $100 per hour but only work one hour
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:49.520]   per week, it's going to be hard for me to run amok like a superstar. Assuming that the total
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.640]   absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams, not an arbitrary point of comparison
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:58.960]   with the Joneses, relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the new rich.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:05.520]   So Tim goes on and he makes some good points about that, but the key that I'd just like to
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.800]   point at is many people, in my observation, and consider if this is applying to you,
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.800]   are working towards this huge number, this huge goal, thinking that somehow money is going to
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:22.720]   make them happier, thinking that somehow money is going to solve all of their problems. Money
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:30.560]   doesn't solve all of your problems. Money creates a lot of problems of its own. As part of planning,
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:37.680]   consider what Tim Ferriss calls his dreamlining program. And again, you'll have to read the book
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.160]   for details. I'm just going to read one paragraph from it. But basically what he talks about is
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.400]   figuring out what your dreams are and then determining the exact cost of those dreams,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.320]   and then calculating your target monthly income for your dreams based upon various timelines.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   But the key example that really -- let's see, I read this book, May of 2007, my notes in the front
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.600]   say May of 2007. And I've never forgotten, seven years ago, I've never forgotten about this. To me,
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.760]   it's a powerful concept. I'm going to read this one paragraph. And it struck me because I was
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.600]   always this finance nerd that said, "Don't ever finance anything. Don't lease cars. Don't rent
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.200]   stuff. Buy stuff. You've got to be rich." If financeable, what is the cost per month for each
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:25.040]   of the four dreams? Rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, et cetera. Start thinking of income
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:30.640]   and expenses in terms of monthly cash flow, dollars in and dollars out, instead of grand
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:38.000]   totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:47.600]   Spider, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:57.520]   personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it through eBay for $136,000, or $2,003.10
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.960]   per month. And he goes on and gives more examples. But the point is that if you figure out what
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.200]   exactly it is, if you have a shopping list, and this is how these things tie together, if you have
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.840]   an actual shopping list, you can sit down and set an actual price tag and figure out how much money
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:17.680]   you have. I don't have any interest in owning a Lamborghini. But if that's important and I want
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   to go rent one or I want to lease one for a couple of years, whatever it is, if I have it, then I can
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:28.480]   figure it out. So it's not up to me to tell you what you should spend your money on. But consider
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:36.320]   them. Consider really choosing your hobbies carefully. I had an example with a prospective
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   financial planning client many years ago. And I was sitting down with him and the guy was telling
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.920]   me about his assets. And he's like, I think I got a lot of money. I think I got some money here,
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.040]   money there, money here, money there. And he starts telling me. And I'm writing them down
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.440]   dutifully. And at the end of it, we calculate out his balance sheet and the guy's a millionaire.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.280]   And it totally surprised him. He's like, I didn't know that. I didn't know he was a millionaire.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:03.920]   But what I found is by looking into him, he lived in a normal middle class house. He lived in a,
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:10.160]   you know, this guy was in Boca. He was in Boca Raton or Fort Lauderdale, Florida, not exactly
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.960]   inexpensive places to live. But his primary hobby was mountain biking. He loved to go mountain
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.280]   biking. And so for him, tossing his mountain bike on the back of the car and going away for the
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:26.560]   weekend, it wasn't an expensive thing. It didn't cost a lot of money. Now, I'm going to read
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.880]   another section here. And this is from a book. Doing a lot of reading today. But these are just
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:38.240]   things as I was preparing the outline, I said, why should I reinvent the wheel if an author has
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.000]   already done a good job of getting my point across? So I'm going to read a section here on
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.280]   budgets from a book called Seven Years to Seven Figures, the Fast Track Plan to Becoming a
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.760]   Millionaire. The author here is Michael Masterson. That's actually a pen name for a man named Mark
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.920]   Ford. He actually lives here in Delray Beach near me. And he published for years the online website
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:08.160]   and newsletter called Early to Rise. He writes a lot about money. So one of the things that is
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.600]   interesting about this is in this book, he's talking about plans, how to become a millionaire
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:22.240]   in seven years. And this is really good stuff. He points out how to do it. And it's not scammy.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:29.200]   It's really legitimate. It's very legitimate. So in the beginning, though, he's trying to say,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:36.080]   how do you figure out how big your goal is? Seven figures can mean anything from $1 million to $9,999,000.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.120]   That's all seven figures. And so he talks through what some budgets would be. I'm going to read
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.440]   these. There are four budgets. And I'm going to read some budget categories. I've pulled out a
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:54.640]   good bit of the text, and I'm just to shorten it. But just consider this. And the point of reading
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.720]   this is to talk about, could you actually spend millions of dollars? Because most of the time,
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.040]   when people tell me how much money you want, $5 million, $10 million, when they ask me. Or I want
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.600]   to spend $100,000 a year if they're not spending that. Now, where I live, there's lots of people
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.200]   spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. We'll set that aside for a moment. Because
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.320]   generally, if they're already doing that, they're earning a certain income. And it's a different
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:23.360]   planning situation. I'm talking just in a generalized view. And just figure out, could
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:29.200]   you actually spend this much money, coping with a mere million? To begin at the beginning, ask
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.520]   yourself, would a net worth of $1 million be enough for me? A million dollars earning 10%
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:41.040]   yields $100,000 in annual income. Set aside the whole earning 10% thing for now. Just get the
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:47.760]   point. Take away about $35,000 for federal, state, and local taxes. That leaves you with $65,000 in
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:54.400]   cash. What kind of lifestyle would $65,000 buy? Well, let's start with housing. You could spend
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:02.240]   a lot, but I've made it a rule to never spend more than 25% of my income on housing. 25% of $65,000
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:12.320]   is $16,250, or about $1,350 a month. What kind of housing would that give you? In figuring housing
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.720]   costs, I always think in terms of rental costs, because the rental market is tied to what people
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:22.160]   can actually afford. So think about where you'd like to live once you achieve financial independence,
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:28.400]   and then ask yourself, what kind of home could I rent in that neighborhood for $1,350 a month?
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:36.720]   If you did spend $1,350 a month on rent, you'd have about $4,000 left over to pay for other
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:41.840]   expenses. Utilities, upkeep, and routine maintenance on your home might be as much as
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:49.040]   30% of your rental costs. That's $405. And you could expect to pay another $900 a month for food
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:55.840]   and household supplies. Transportation would be your next biggest expense. Figure $600 a month for
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:01.920]   two medium-sized Toyotas. Those are your major expenses. Do the math, and you'll see that you
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.600]   are left with about $2,000 for things like travel, entertainment, dinners out, and other non-essentials.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:13.040]   Those expenses can vary greatly depending on your personal preferences. If you can be happy with a
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.760]   good meal at a local restaurant, you may be able to budget meals for two people at $80.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.880]   If you prefer fancier places, you'll have to figure on spending two or three times that amount.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.680]   I'm in the fortunate position of being able to pay whatever I want for restaurant meals,
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   and I'm happy to tell you that, although I do enjoy the occasional $500 meal, I'm usually just
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.880]   as happy eating meatballs and spaghetti at my local trattoria. Developing a plebeian palate
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.440]   will do a lot for your future happiness if your goal is to achieve a net worth of only $1,000,000.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.960]   The $2.5 Million Lifestyle
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.320]   Living on a nest egg of a million dollars could be completely satisfying,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.600]   so long as you are content with modest choices. If you have a family that is larger than two people,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.760]   or if you want to be able to live on a somewhat higher level, you may want to target your net
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:07.440]   worth at $2 or $3 million. For the purposes of this discussion, let's pick a number in between,
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:14.560]   $2.5 million. What will a net worth of $2.5 million buy you? Again, assuming a 10%
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:22.560]   ROI and a tax burden of 35%, you'd end up with disposable after-tax income of about $160,000 a
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:29.440]   year. And again, figuring that 25% of that $160,000 will go into housing, ask yourself if
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.760]   you could be satisfied living in a house or apartment in your chosen neighborhood that
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:42.000]   would rent for about $40,000 a year, or $3,300 a month. In my neck of the woods, near the ocean in
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.440]   southeast Florida, that would get you a nice, older, two or three bedroom house within walking
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.560]   distance of town. If you want to live in Minneapolis, you'll do much better than that on
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:58.000]   the same budget. Don't laugh, it's a great city. On that kind of income, you can live there in a
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.680]   modern, spacious, six bedroom house with all the bells and whistles. Figuring, again, that you'd
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:10.240]   spend 30% of your housing budget on associated living expenses, you'd budget about $12,000 a
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:17.120]   year for utilities, repairs, maintenance, and upkeep. Other associated expenses, food, clothing,
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:25.520]   and so on, might account for another $13,000 a year for a total of $25,000. That may seem a bit
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:31.360]   high percentage-wise as compared to the $1 million budget, but it's a financial fact of life that the
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:38.240]   more you pay for your home, the more you'll pay for living expenses. By the way, interrupt myself,
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   notice that one, and it's absolutely true. The research shows it out, Tom Stanley's research,
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.360]   without question. The more you pay for your home, the more you'll pay for living expenses,
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:53.600]   just simply due to the associated lifestyle costs. Subtract the cost of housing, $40,000 a year,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:51:00.640]   and associated living expenses, $25,000 a year, and you are left with about $95,000 to spend on
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.960]   luxuries. $95,000 after tax dollars a year will provide two people with a lot of extras.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.720]   Just for fun, let's look at what a $95,000 lifestyle budget might buy.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:18.400]   10-day Hawaiian vacation for two, $11,000. 10-day London vacation for two, $11,000.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:29.200]   52 semi-fancy dinners at $200 each, $10,400. 52 dinners at a local place at $100 each, $5,200.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:38.400]   Lease upgrade on two Mercedes, $14,400. Overboard holiday party for 50 friends, $7,500.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:44.960]   Extravagant Christmas gifts, $3,000. Golf club membership for two, $5,000.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:52.480]   Spoil and presents for eight grandchildren, $4,000. 52 spa treatments, $5,200.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:52:03.520]   10% charity church tithing, $9,500. Where did that money go? Money, $8,800. Total, $95,000.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.760]   I'm going to pause for a moment here. Notice how difficult it is to spend $95,000
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:16.720]   after you've taken care of housing, associated living expenses with housing, and food.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.840]   It's not easy to spend $95,000. You've got to work at it.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.600]   Now, I would say there are many people, again, depending on where you're at in the country,
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:31.120]   this may be a normal lifestyle or this may be extravagantly rich. To me, this is not that,
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.200]   just based upon where I live, this is not that out of sight. This is a fairly normal,
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:41.120]   it's not normal. Our median income is not, the median income is not $250,000.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:49.520]   And then the after-tax income is not $160,000 a year as far as the median wage. But that's,
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.600]   I would say that for a financial planner, that's probably an average client base of clients that
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:01.920]   are making $250,000 a year. So notice that it's fairly difficult to spend that money.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:09.360]   You have to work hard at it. Again, some of these expenditures are arbitrary. You might not,
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.760]   for example, enjoy traveling abroad, or you might find your grandchildren deplorable.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.320]   In reviewing this list, make whatever substitutions you like, so long as they are in the same expense
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.360]   categories. Overall, this is a very luxurious lifestyle, wouldn't you say?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:32.320]   So it's a good example because there was $2.5 million on his numbers. You figure out it's a
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:36.480]   little bit challenging. Well, let's go on and let's look at two other budgets. And I apologize
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:40.560]   if these lists are long, but I just think it's kind of funny. Because most people say, "Hey,
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.040]   I want to have a," many people say, I shouldn't say most, many people say, "I want to have a $5
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:52.240]   million net worth," but the reality is that they have never sat down and figured out,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:57.040]   "How much money would I spend if I had $5 million?" So let's look at the next level,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:05.840]   living on a $5.5 million nest egg. A $5.5 million net worth returning 10% is $550,000 a year,
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:14.320]   or $357,500 after paying 35% in taxes. Deduct $90,000 for your housing expense,
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:23.600]   another $30,000 for upkeep and utilities, $27,500 for food, clothing, and miscellaneous.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.480]   I don't know how you spend $27,500 on food and clothing and miscellaneous, but then again,
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:34.560]   I don't shop. And you'd end up with... I guess I do shop, but I don't shop for consumption clothing
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:40.400]   items. And you'd end up with $210,000 a year to spend on discretionary items. Let's see how
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:47.600]   $210,000 pans out. 10-day Hawaiian vacation for two, 10 grand. 10-day London vacation for two,
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:54.400]   10 grand. 10-day Istanbul trip for two, 15 grand. Two four-day weekends in New York City, 12,000.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:06.800]   52 very fancy meals at $500 each, $26,000. 52 semi-fancy meals at $200 each, $10,400.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:17.680]   104 meals at the local place at $100 each, $10,400. Lease upgrade on two Mercedes, $14,400.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:26.560]   Overboard holiday party for 100 friends, $14,000. Extravagant Christmas gifts, $5,400.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   Golf club membership for two, $5,000. Spoilum presents for eight grandchildren, $4,000.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:42.400]   100 spa treatments, $10,000. 10% charity or church tithing, $21,000.
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:50.160]   Where did that money go? Money, $15,000. Two season tickets for an NBA team, $8,000.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:58.320]   Tennis club membership, lessons for two, $5,000. Slightly used ski-do snowmobile, $3,000.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:05.680]   120 sessions with a personal trainer, $11,400. Total, $210,000.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:11.760]   Living like this takes a lot of effort. Spending this much money requires diligence,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:17.520]   determination, and imagination. For one thing, you must be willing to eat out four nights a week.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:22.720]   You must devote nearly all your spare time to golfing, tennis, spa treatments, and professional
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:28.320]   basketball games. You would have to eschew low-cost leisure activities like reading, hiking, and
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:35.920]   fishing, except for deep-sea fishing in luxury spots. And you'd have to...okay, I'm kidding,
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:41.440]   or at least half-kidding to make a point. You don't need $5 or $6 million in the bank
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.240]   to enjoy a very good lifestyle. Good point, huh? Let's look at the last one,
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.840]   and then we'll be done with these budgets. The ultimate lifestyle. Again, $9 million at 10%
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.920]   will yield an income of $900,000. After paying 35% of that to Uncle Sam, you'd have $585,000
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:11.040]   to spend on yourself and your spouse. If you spent 25% of that, or $146,250 a year on housing,
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   you'd be living in luxury, even in California, Florida, or Manhattan.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:24.080]   Figure $45,000 a year for upkeep and utilities, a whopping $50,000 a year for food and clothing.
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:30.000]   Let's stick to Italian designers, please. And you're left with about $345,000 a year.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.960]   How could you get rid of $345,000 a year? 10-day Hawaiian vacation for $2,000.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.920]   10 grand. 10-day London vacation for $2,000. 10 grand. 10-day Istanbul trip for $2,000.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.480]   15 grand. 4 four-day weekends in New York City, $24,000.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:57.280]   52 very fancy meals at $500 each, $26,000. 52 semi-fancy meals at $200 each, $10,400.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:08.000]   104 meals at the local place at $100 each, $10,400. Lease upgrade on two Mercedes, $14,400.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:16.880]   Way overboard holiday party for 100 friends, $20,000. Ultra extravagant Christmas gifts, $10,000.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:24.480]   Golf club membership for two, $5,000. Really spoil 'em presents for eight grandchildren, $8,000.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:31.600]   104 spa treatments, $10,400. Charity church tithing, $40,000.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:38.240]   Where did that money go? Money, $24,000. Two season tickets for an NBA team, $8,000.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:44.880]   Tennis club membership for two, $5,000. 120 sessions with a personal trainer, $11,400.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:51.600]   Bose home theater system, $4,100. Sony VAIO notebook computers for you,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:58.720]   your spouse, and all eight grandchildren, $22,000. High definition mini-cam quarter, $3,600.
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:05.040]   Matching diamond and platinum ring earrings and pendant from Tiffany, $16,250.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:14.560]   52 weeks of fresh flower delivery, $4,450. Three widescreen plasma TV sets, $15,000.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.800]   Stereo systems for two cars, $4,000. Digital cameras for you, your spouse,
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.960]   and all eight grandchildren, $13,600. Total, $345,000.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.880]   As you can see, you can live reasonably well without working on a net worth of $1,000,000.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:39.920]   Having $2,000,000 or $3,000,000 in the bank makes life easy. If you target the $5-$9,000,000 range,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:44.960]   you'll be able to enjoy all the luxuries you have ever imagined, and still have money left over that
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.000]   you won't know what to do with. Of course, if you decide to target the higher end of the seven
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   figure range, you'll have to expect to work harder and take more risk to achieve your goal.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.240]   Interesting, huh? Hopefully you enjoy that. I know it's easy to get lost in the columns of
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.520]   numbers. This book was published... Let's see here. When did I get it? I don't have a note as
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:20.160]   far as when I got it, but the copyright date is 2006. It's funny. 2006, notice this. Sony VAIO
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:29.200]   notebook computers, 10 of them for $22,000. High definition mini camcorder, $3,600. Three widescreen
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:36.160]   plasma TV sets, $15,000. Consider 2006 to 2014 as eight years, and consider how much cheaper those
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.800]   things are today. He puts in here, "Digital cameras for you, your spouse, and all eight
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:47.200]   grandchildren, $13,600." Just think of how much cheaper those things are. The point is, have you
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.360]   ever actually sat down and made a budget? If you're targeting a net worth of $5,000,000, have you ever
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.600]   sat down and figured out, "Do I need to target that, or am I just targeting that for some stupid
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:05.120]   ego reason?" I challenge you to see if you can figure out how to spend that much money. It also
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:13.280]   illustrates why. Think about that lifestyle that he went through of $9,000,000, of a $9,000,000 net
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:19.200]   worth. Why, when Tom Stanley talks about the glittering rich, who can walk in and buy a brand
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.240]   new Mercedes and not pay any attention to it, who can spend money lavishly without even paying
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.600]   attention to it? That's one of many reasons why the rich continually get richer. Because once you
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:35.520]   reach a certain point of mass, it's hard to spend the money. You can't possibly spend the money.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:40.400]   And so because you can't possibly spend the money, you either give it away, or it grows over time,
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.320]   or you become very imaginative at spending the money. I shouldn't say you can't possibly, because
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:55.200]   the financial newspapers are rife with examples of people who have blown through massive fortunes.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:03.120]   How I'm always perplexed, but they do. It's so easy in today's world, and in the United States
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.600]   of America. I want to be specific about that. The rest of the world is not the same. But in the
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:14.560]   United States of America, or in any well-developed economy, I don't know what the politically correct
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.160]   term or even the right term is. Western world, I'm not sure. In today's modern rich economies,
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:27.120]   it's so easy to live rich. The poorest person, I guarantee, the poorest person listening to this
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   show right now lives better than John D. Rockefeller lived in many ways. I'm reading a
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:43.040]   biography of Rockefeller right now, and it's just, I mean, the poorest person lives better than he
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.120]   does. So what is wealth? Is wealth the number of dollars in the bank? Or is wealth the amount of
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:55.280]   time and the energy that you have? A billionaire doesn't get more than 24 hours in a day.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:02.320]   Where do you spend your 24 hours? I think it makes all the sense in the world to focus on living
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.800]   rich. If we spend eight hours a day in bed, make sure it's a really great bed. If we spend eight
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.600]   hours a day in an office, make sure it's a really awesome office that you like being in. And make
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.800]   sure if you're going to spend eight hours a day doing something that it's something that you want
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:25.200]   to do. A rich person really can't get that much better coffee than what you can get for a few
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:33.360]   bucks. If you want a bottle of wine, you can't drink more than a bottle a day. You could afford,
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:40.640]   on a fairly modest income, you can afford that. A brand new, what are these things cost? $8,000,
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.800]   $9,000? A brand new $9,000, let's call it $10,000 because I can't remember what the actual number
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:54.960]   is. A brand new $10,000 Kia Rio is an amazing car compared to a 1990 Cadillac. Which would you
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.280]   rather go in? The Cadillac that's kind of flying down the highway, the springs up and down? It's
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:05.680]   better than a 1990 Mercedes. The Kia Rio will drive all day long at 75, 80 miles an hour, has
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:12.720]   air conditioning, it'll get 40 miles a gallon. And it'll be more comfortable, safer than the
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.360]   1990 Cadillac. Now, maybe there's exceptions to that. Maybe a 1990 Rolls Royce would be better.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:23.760]   But the point is that things are cheaper now than they've ever been. A millionaire can't eat more
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:30.240]   food than you can. The rich, the glittering rich, if they want to stop for a hamburger, they're
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.160]   still going to stop at the same fast food restaurants that you are. They're going to fly in
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.680]   the same airplanes, unless it's a private plane, but they're going to get there as fast as you are.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:46.160]   They're going to drive on the same road, whether or not you're sitting in a $300,000 car or not,
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.440]   if you're sitting in traffic, you're still sitting in traffic. You know, it's interesting, I live
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.760]   very close to Palm Beach Island and also to Jupiter Island, which are two of the
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.600]   enclaves of the rich. And I'll tell you, there is a very sharp
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:11.280]   culture difference between the old rich and the new rich, the nouveau riche, you know,
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.200]   if you were going to go with the way that you usually see it written. And that culture, I think,
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:22.000]   is the nouveau riche is the guy who struck it big in acting, or who struck it big in, you know, in
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.880]   sports or something. And it's just, how can I spend on everything that glitters? The old money,
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.320]   you know, frankly, the other reason by my best guess, why people live on Palm Beach Island,
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   they live there for privacy, and they live there to have a community of people who are like them.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:44.000]   It's hard if, you know, it's hard if you're if you are mega wealthy, it's hard to be rich with,
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.720]   excuse me, hard to be friends with people who aren't, because it's difficult for people to
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.920]   understand each other's lifestyles. It's not that they're not friends, but it's that it's just hard.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:01.200]   So the money pays for a certain level of privacy, and it pays for a certain level of social club,
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.520]   people understanding you. My major point is there are costs to achieving your goals, and it takes
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:12.480]   time to make money. So is your wealth measured in money? Or is your wealth measured in time?
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:20.320]   Is it measured in energy? Physical financial wealth is a burden. It really is. You have to
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.840]   give up something to get it. At the very beginning, you have to give up hours of your time, you may
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.680]   then later have to give up energy, you may have to give up focus. Having multiple houses is a burden,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.960]   now you have to manage these multiple houses. Wealth is a burden. People quickly say, well,
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.360]   it's a burden that I'm ready to take. True. And I think a certain level of it is valuable,
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:49.520]   but it really is a burden. The key is that if you see yourself as constantly being able to just buy
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:57.600]   more, buy more, buy more, you're being manipulated. The idea of conspicuous consumption is pure
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:04.240]   manipulation, it's pure propaganda that has been fed to our culture intentionally by the marketing
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:12.800]   industry. You're being manipulated. Get rid of your ego, shut off the manipulation,
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.440]   turn off the TV, stop paying attention to the ads, and think about what you actually want.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:24.080]   It's all marketing. It's amazing how if you'll cut some of that influence out of your mind,
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.280]   if you'll cut the commercials off, if you cut yourself off from the Madison Avenues and the
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.800]   magazines, the ads in the back of the magazines and all that stuff, if you just cut all that off,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:43.040]   your desire over time will die. I learned this myself with traveling. When I was in college,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:47.920]   I lived in Costa Rica for a semester and studied abroad. When I was there, I didn't have a car,
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:52.320]   and I was living in Costa Rica, which is not a poor country, but it's also not one of the
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:59.760]   mega-rich countries. One of the things that I learned while being there is that I really wished
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:07.600]   I had a car, but many people didn't have cars because they're very expensive in Costa Rica.
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:14.400]   After I got back from that trip and I got back to the States, I was just so excited about
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:22.960]   simply having a car. I didn't care what it looked like. I was just excited about the pure having of
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:29.680]   a car being valuable. If you cut off the influence and you cut off the input, you can make some
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:37.200]   substantial progress toward your goals. I'm going to close by reading an excerpt from
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:45.120]   the end of Tom Stanley's book where he has a letter. This is how he finished his book. He has
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:53.200]   a letter that somebody wrote to him and then his response, which really illustrates my point.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:01.280]   I think he's done such a great job of writing this. This chapter is entitled, "All that glitters
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:07.760]   is not the millionaire's goal." It opens with a quote, "That man is richest whose pleasures are
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:14.000]   cheapest." Henry David Thoreau. There is something else about wealthy people that sets them apart
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.920]   from others. Most wealthy people have a wide variety of interests and activities. In fact,
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.560]   there is a substantial correlation between the number of interests and activities that people
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.720]   are involved in and their level of financial wealth. Some wealthy people feel that owning
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:36.320]   a vacation home, for instance, would restrict them, obligate them to spend a lot of time there,
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.720]   and if they do not spend much time there, they feel guilty for allocating lots of dollars on
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.080]   something that is underutilized. Most millionaires came to this realization without first having to
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.400]   make the mistake of purchasing a vacation home. Many respondents have told me about the emotions
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.880]   associated with owning vacation homes. First, joy and euphoria, shortly followed by a loss of
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.480]   interest, and then resentment at having to pay for something that is rarely used but drains financial
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:11.360]   resources. Many rich people, however, rank high on the cosmopolitan scale. They like variety and
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:18.080]   change in their lives. Being tied down to a vacation home is just so parochial. They say
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.160]   the same thing about owning a boat. So if millionaires don't own vacation homes, what do
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.160]   they do? I asked the DECA millionaires I surveyed about some of the activities that they engaged in
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:34.960]   during the prior 12 months. Here are some of the more popular activities reported.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:44.000]   Visiting museums, 83%. Raising funds for charities, 75%. Consulting tax experts, 75%.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:52.240]   Attending fundraising balls, 75%. Participating in civic activities, 69%.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:11:01.840]   Attending major league sporting events, 69%. Vacationing overseas, 69%. Attending Broadway
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:08.000]   plays, 67%. Participating in trade or professional association activities, 56%.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:16.960]   Shopping for original art, 56%. Gardening, 55%. Attending antique fairs or sales, 55%.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:26.080]   Fishing, 33%. Skiing in the Rockies, 33%. Vacationing in Paris, 28%.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:32.240]   Popular activities that DECA millionaires listed in their diaries over a 30-day period included
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:40.480]   socializing with children or grandchildren, 95%. Pay attention to this one. Planning investments,
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:48.720]   94%. 94% of DECA millionaires in the last 30 days have spent time planning investments.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:56.560]   Entertaining close friends, 87%. Watching their children or grandchildren playing sports, 66%.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:05.280]   Studying art, 63%. Playing golf, 60%. Attending religious services, 52%.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:16.000]   Jogging, 48%. Praying, 47%. Attending lectures, 44%. Caring for elderly relatives, 44%.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.520]   Playing tennis, 30%. What do these wealthy people know that many vacation homeowners,
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:31.040]   boat owners, and seekers of prestige brands have overlooked? You cannot be in two places at one
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:39.600]   time. Mostly what they know is that it is life activities that give pleasure and satisfaction,
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:46.160]   not the watch on your wrist. The following letter exchange is a reminder that we should all take
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.240]   time to stop and smell the roses. Dear Dr. Stanley, I have finished your book,
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:57.440]   The Millionaire Next Door. I have some experience with some millionaires, and I'd say you have them
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:04.320]   down real well. They know who they are. Frugal. Cheap. I sure don't believe in living beyond my
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   means and never have. It is a great idea to invest in your own business, or in stocks, or real estate.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:16.320]   The only error I see in your book is that this is the end-all and be-all of life.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.200]   Owning cars. The expensive model looks better, lasts longer, runs faster, needs less repairs,
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.760]   has better resale value, and is generally a lot nicer to own. I've owned both types of cars. A
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:36.800]   nice Mercedes costs more than a Ford because it's a better car. A number one Oxford or Hickey Freeman
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.000]   man's suit is better than a seer's off-the-rack suit. The material is better, the workmanship is
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.400]   better, the style is better, and it lasts at least five times longer. I've had both. A cheap
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.360]   golf shirt from Walmart costing $6-10 will last about one or two years with proper care. A $50
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.560]   Ralph Lauren golf shirt is a lot better quality and with good care will last about 20 years.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:07.440]   I know. I've had both. A Casio $20 watch from Walmart will keep just as good time as a Gubelin
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:12.880]   watch from Switzerland, but I hope you don't think it's just as good a watch. I've got both,
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:20.000]   and I don't think so. A vacation in Emporia, Kansas, Athens, Georgia, or going through the
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.080]   south of France or to Athens, Greece. I don't think they are all equal vacation spots, and I've been
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.080]   to all of them. Shopping at Walmart or Sears is not quite the experience as shopping at Neiman
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:38.160]   Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue is. It is great to make money and save money, but if these types
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:43.040]   don't let up after a while and smell the roses, they are a little bit nutty, aren't they?
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:48.400]   As I recall it, Mr. Sam Walton lived a life pretty much like you seem to feel is great.
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.760]   Unfortunately for Mr. Walton, I seem to recall him getting some terrible form of cancer
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:59.120]   and meeting an early death. I wonder if he said to his doctors and close ones on his deathbed,
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.640]   "Gee, I wish I would have spent more time at the store." What do you think?
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.800]   Sincerely yours, Mr. H. Affluent, Florida
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:16.160]   Dear Mr. H., Accumulating wealth is not the end-all and be-all of life. Yet it is considerably
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:22.640]   easier to accumulate wealth if you get great satisfaction from elements in your life that do
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.480]   not require hyper-spending. Far too many people believe that in order to smell the roses,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.800]   in essence to enjoy life, they must purchase prestige brands. Yet the data indicates that
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.920]   there is little correlation between this type of spending and happiness. But those who spend with
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:47.120]   the hope that happiness will result will be disappointed. Basic to happiness are factors
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:54.400]   such as health, family, job, and values. If you have good health, a loving family,
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.640]   are surrounded by a network of caring friends, have a job you enjoy, doing without certain luxury
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:06.560]   items is not painful. But what if your work pays well but is not satisfying? You may think that
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.680]   loading up on luxury goods will cure your discontent, but hyper-spending will only make
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:19.040]   things worse. Displaying luxury brands may or may not impress your neighbors, but it will not
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.240]   transform an unhappy person into a happy one. Or as many millionaires have told me,
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:32.000]   money makes life easier, not better. Most millionaires were happy even before they
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.160]   became financially independent. They set goals and achieved them. One of their goals was to
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:43.920]   accumulate wealth. They built their wealth slowly but steadily and controlled their spending instead
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.520]   of the other way around. These are confident people, people in control of their lives.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:57.120]   Products and houses do not control them. Certainly, smelling the roses has something
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:05.280]   to do with being married to a wonderful spouse. Most millionaires, 91%, are married, on average,
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:12.480]   for 36 years to the same spouse. Fully two-thirds have never been divorced. I have often said that
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:18.880]   if you want to live forever, marry the wrong spouse. Do so and every day will be an eternity.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.360]   No amount of luxury goods will make you happy if each day is an eternity. But marry the right
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.680]   person and every day will be a joy. Millionaires are not misers, especially when it comes to
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.320]   funding the educations of their children and grandchildren, and even nieces and nephews,
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.720]   or donating to noble causes. Certainly, part of smelling the roses is the realization that
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:48.400]   you helped finance your son or daughter's business school, medical school, or law school education.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:54.640]   This variety of rose has an aroma superior to owning even dozens of expensive cars,
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:01.680]   watches, suits, boats, or even vacation homes. Those who are frugal in spending tend to be the
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:08.720]   most generous in terms of donating to charity and other so-called "good causes." But those who are
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.520]   hyper-spenders, including many high-income, low-net-worth types, have few dollars, if any,
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.760]   to give. Generous givers smell the aroma that emanates from the flowers produced by helping
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:26.160]   others who are not so fortunate. You mentioned that the founder of Walmart, Sam Walton, may have
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.840]   not smelled the roses. I never had the honor of meeting Mr. Walton, but from my reading I have a
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:37.200]   different view of the man. I have come across his profile and picture more often in sports
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.880]   periodicals than in the business press. From his profile, I can only surmise that Mr. Walton was
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.440]   not an all-work, no-play type. Often, he was depicted on a bird-shooting hunt, along with
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:56.320]   his pickup truck, Remington shotgun, and favorite hunting dog, Ol' Roy. In honor of Ol' Roy, you
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:02.720]   might note the brand name on Walmart's private label, Dog Food. Yes, it is the Ol' Roy brand,
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.800]   in a wide variety of sizes and textures. It was not only Mr. Walton's choice of motor vehicle,
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:14.160]   a Ford pickup truck, that impressed me. His shotgun was a Remington 870 Wingmaster pump.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.040]   I purchased the same gun because I figured that if it were good enough for a billionaire,
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   it was certainly good enough for me. I do not know how much he paid for his Wingmaster,
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:34.720]   but I paid $449.92 for mine at a Walmart store. You can pay $2,000, $5,000, $10,000, or even
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.680]   $50,000 for a shotgun. But you can't buy a better shotgun than an 870 Remington. To date, they have
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:48.080]   sold more than 10 million 870s. It is strong and extraordinarily reliable. It gives me all the
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:55.120]   rows I need, and I have a feeling that Mr. Walton felt the same way. Yet the aspirationals at my
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   gun club, a small minority, refer to my shotgun as obsolete, an iron boat anchor. They own Gilded
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.640]   Shotguns, European brands of the four- and five-figure variety. Their comments about my
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:15.440]   Remington never bother me in the least. In fact, I think of them as humorous. Plus, they provide
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.560]   input for my research. The clay pigeons that I shoot at do not seem to care how much I paid
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.720]   for my shotgun. It shoots straight and has never jammed. I bought mine to shoot, and not in an
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.400]   effort to display status among my fellow club members. My status comes from my score, not the
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:38.720]   gun. Plus, being around my good friends, all are frugal, when shooting, is much more important
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:44.480]   than the price of the gun. This is in sharp contrast to those people who feel the need to own
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:50.800]   the Gilded variety of every gun they shoot, every suit they wear, and every car they drive.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.600]   These types of people think that anyone with means who acts otherwise is suffering,
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:03.280]   never smelling the roses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, even some billionaires and
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:09.200]   maybe many deca-millionaires prefer to drive pickup trucks. And there are plenty of wealthy
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:14.560]   people who shoot Remingtons. In contrast, I recently read an article that mentioned the
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:22.880]   sale of a shotgun for $287,500. It was originally made for Tsar Nicholas of Russia. The gun not only
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.480]   had a lot of history, but it also had hand engraving all over it. To me, it looked really
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:35.840]   ugly, like the gilding of gildings. I understand that most things that the Tsar owned were top-of-the-line
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:42.160]   brands. He used these "things" to tell his subjects and himself that he was superior.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:48.560]   Well, we know what happened to him. In contrast, most of the self-made rich in America do not have
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.560]   the same urgent need to document their superiority via the display of prestige brands.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:00.240]   What does this tell us about people who try to act rich by spending and displaying but are not?
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:07.360]   While searching for roses to smell, they overdress, overdrive, and overact. No, they are not Walmart
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:12.800]   type shoppers, but they would enhance the probability of actually becoming rich if they
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:19.600]   would patronize stores of this type. America is a nation of excesses, and these excesses,
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.240]   especially when it comes to consumption, have a profound influence upon our young.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.280]   They are constantly told that spending is the American way. Often, their role models are highly
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:36.960]   compensated professional athletes and entertainers. Day after day, the public relations machinery
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.760]   keeps cranking out stories about the multi-million dollar mansions that this athlete has purchased
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.600]   or the fleet of exotic cars that this movie star owns. By sensationalizing and glorifying these
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.920]   powerful role models, the press sends a message. It says that happiness is obtained by spending
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.600]   freely on cars, homes, and parties. But in reality, spending will not make people happy,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.480]   and very few people grow up to become star athletes or movie celebrities.
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.400]   Recently, our local newspaper published an article that featured in glowing terms
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.040]   the home of a professional baseball player. The article mentioned that the interior space
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:21.440]   of the highly decorated nine-bedroom home was 25,000 square feet. Apparently, this fellow is
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:27.600]   an all-star in terms of spending. What else is so interesting about this home? Nationwide,
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:32.960]   only 3% of America's deca-millionaires live in a home that has nine or more bedrooms.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.240]   The square footage of this baseball player's home is four and one-half times larger than the
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:44.480]   medium square feet (5,600) of the primary homes owned by the chief executive officers of Standard
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:51.440]   & Poor's 500 firms. These are America's Major League caliber business leaders who run companies
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.600]   that generate billions in sales revenue and employ millions of Americas. Could it be that many of
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.800]   these CEOs do not feel the same need as the baseball player to display their success and
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.200]   supposedly enhance their status via homes, car, and accessories? Perhaps just being the head of
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:15.120]   a major corporation has a lot of status attached to it all by itself. And, in terms of making a
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.720]   real contribution to our economy, these CEOs have a much higher batting average than the baseball
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.080]   player. In fact, in this regard, he probably belongs in the minor leagues. Nonetheless,
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.680]   he is still a role model, a poster child for the "Smell the Roses" society of hyper-consumers in
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:38.320]   America. We cannot count on the press to paint an accurate picture of how carefully most achievers
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:44.000]   allocate their dollars. Yet most achievers are very satisfied with their lives. Their satisfaction
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.200]   has little to do with the brands that they own. We would do well to adopt the values of the
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.720]   majority of the real achievers in America, and not those who are of the "star" variety.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:00.720]   The big house baseball player, a one-in-a-million young phenom, was born with his extraordinary
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:06.800]   talent. But most achievers know that their type of success was not predetermined. Often it takes
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.120]   twenty or thirty years before they break into their own version of the really big league.
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:19.520]   What happens when owning the better brands takes priority over achieving? When it's about having
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:26.240]   money just to spend, people can't survive. It is one thing to enjoy an increased standard of living.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:32.560]   It is another when it is all about money for spending on prestige brands. Individual
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:38.560]   achievement, small and large, today and tomorrow, is what leads to an increased standard of living.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.600]   It is about the Bill Gates of the world creating firms that make products that make our lives
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:49.200]   better and more productive. It is about the teacher who labors to teach a class of fifth
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:56.080]   graders math. These are the things and activities that lead to improvements in life. In short,
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.880]   when it becomes about brand, less energy and money is spent on things and activities that
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.960]   will actually benefit people, which may explain why America has to import its engineers from India,
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.840]   a place where academic achievement is highly valued. It is not easy to break bad habits,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:17.600]   but doing so will make us happier and ultimately lead to richer lives for all,
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.960]   now and tomorrow. Sincerely, Thomas J. Stanley.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:27.040]   Get his book.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:35.600]   The nice things are toys, and it is fine to accumulate them, but accumulate them after
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:43.040]   you build wealth. Don't increase the risk you take with your financial plan just to accumulate
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:50.160]   some nice things. Money makes life easier, but there are lots of things that it cannot buy you.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:56.800]   It may make it easier to achieve many things, and there is a certain amount of money that
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:09.680]   is necessary. Being poor is not fun, but money can't buy you everything. As the saying goes,
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.200]   money can buy you a house, but it can't buy you a love-filled home.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.480]   Money can buy you a clock or a fancy watch, but it can't buy you more time.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:27.040]   Money can buy you an amazing bed, but it can't buy you a good night's sleep.
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:36.160]   Money can buy you a book or even an entire library, but it can't buy you knowledge or wisdom.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   Money can buy you a diploma, but you can't buy an education.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:50.400]   Money can buy a doctor, but it can't buy you good health or energy or vitality.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.240]   Money can buy you food, but it can't buy you an appetite.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:04.240]   Money can buy a position, but not respect. Money can buy blood, but not more life.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.880]   Money can buy sex, but not love or a joyful marriage.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:21.120]   Money can buy insurance, but not safety. Money can buy a companion, but it can't buy you a friend.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.320]   Money is not everything.
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.800]   Consider what you actually are trying to buy
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.600]   with money and consider figuring out that shopping list.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:46.640]   Consider the importance of actually describing exactly what you want and exactly how much you
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:53.760]   need and making an actual realistic budget. Whatever your target level of wealth is,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.680]   sit down and figure out, "Okay, if I had to spend that much money, how much money,
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:05.040]   you know, what would I buy? What could I spend?" The research is fairly conclusive when you study
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:11.440]   it. Again, read all of Tom Stanley's books. Those who accumulate money, it is important,
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:16.400]   but it is not the most important. You do have to pay a price to accumulate money.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.680]   Whatever that price is, it's important to make sure
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.600]   that it's worth it, that the juice is worth the squeeze, as they say.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:31.840]   Money can buy power, but it can't buy respect. Money can't buy sleep, but it can buy a bed.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:37.600]   Money can't buy you love, but it can buy sex. You possess money, you buy money, and you possess.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.280]   Money can buy a house, but it can't buy a home. So even with money, you still feel all alone.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:48.480]   Money can buy you friends, but it can't buy family. Money can't make you happy, that's just a
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:54.880]   fallacy. It can buy a bath, but it can't buy purity. It can buy bodyguards, but it can't buy security.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:00.640]   You all people around the world start by eight, because money can buy war, but it can't buy peace.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:05.120]   Some do everything and anything to get the peas. The society we're living in,
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.280]   it's a necessity. It's got the power to turn your best friends to enemies.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:12.080]   It's funny, but money doesn't follow us to the beach.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:21.040]   If you think something you don't need, you keep it. Then you're stolen from somebody else who's hungry.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:32.960]   Everything that you do is everything you are. Everything that I am is everything you ever need.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   Does happiness live in a mansion with a swimming pool? I know people with plenty of money that are miserable.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:46.960]   We all need to earn in this world we live. Most work for it, some steal, but many worship it.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   Some self-raise and for it, some seek employment for it. We need it to survive, so some clean the toilets for it.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.960]   I need things to live, but never will I live for peace. Abolish the queen, I don't want to see that witch's face.
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:02.960]   I'm not for it, no, not me. Some will try to tell you that it doesn't grow on trees.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.960]   I heard the saying said many a time, but they were wrong. 'Cause if it doesn't tell me, then where do you get the paper from?
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   Most think they'd be happy if they only had more of it. Some waste it, some feel more important 'cause they're born with it.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.960]   Some have got the nerve to say a portion of a fortune if the truth is you don't need a fortune to be fortunate.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   Say you don't need and keep it, then you're stolen from somebody else who's hungry.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:42.960]   Everything that you do is everything you are. Everything that I am is everything you'll ever be.
