[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.720]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.920]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.200]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.840]   My guest today is Dr. Cal Newport.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.720]   Dr. Cal Newport is a professor of computer science
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.520]   at Georgetown University.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.600]   He did his training at MIT,
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600]   and he is currently both a professor
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.680]   and the author of many best-selling books
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.320]   focused on productivity, focus,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.000]   and how to access the specific states of mind
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.080]   to bring out your best in terms of cognitive performance
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.680]   and indeed in terms of performance in all endeavors.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.640]   One of his more notable books is entitled "Deep Work,
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640]   "Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World."
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   "Deep Work" is a book that has had
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.400]   tremendous positive influence on my work life
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.440]   and indeed my life in general,
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.960]   because it spells out how exactly
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.040]   to go about doing one's best possible work.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.080]   For me, that's in the context of science and podcasting,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.120]   but it includes tools that I and many others have extended
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   to other aspects of their life as well,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.440]   and it's a book that I highly,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.400]   highly recommend everybody read.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.260]   Cal also has a new book out now,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.960]   it's one that I'm currently reading,
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.000]   entitled "Slow Productivity,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.840]   "The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout."
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   And as the title suggests,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.320]   it gets into specific protocols to avoid burnout
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.800]   and to bring about one's highest quality work
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.760]   over the greatest amount of time.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.440]   Today's discussion starts off with extremely practical steps
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.200]   that any and all of us can use
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.780]   in order to enhance our level of focus,
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.040]   productivity, and creativity.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.680]   Cal shares much of his specific practices
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.480]   and also offers some alternative practices
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.320]   for those of you that perhaps do not want to disengage
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.480]   with social media or with smartphones or with email
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   to the extent that he does.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   I found the conversation to be extremely useful
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.560]   in the sense that I indeed am on social media,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400]   I use email, I use my phone and texting quite often,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.880]   so I'm not somebody who's willing
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.960]   to completely disengage from those tools,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.280]   but I share in the sentiment that those tools
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.600]   can often be an impediment to doing one's best work.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.800]   So today's discussion gets into not hard and fast rules
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.760]   for enhancing focus and productivity,
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.600]   but a variety of different tools that you can select from
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   in sort of a buffet to suit your particular needs.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640]   We also, of course, discuss the specific research studies
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.280]   around focus and distraction,
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.760]   task switching and context switching,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.200]   all of which support the specific protocols that Cal offers.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.600]   So whether you're somebody who has issues
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.240]   with attention and focus,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.760]   or whether you're somebody that's just feeling
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.960]   overly distracted by the number of things
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.040]   in your email inbox or the number of texts
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   or what's happening out in the world,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.620]   by the end of today's episode,
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.320]   I'm confident that you will be armed
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   with the best science supported tools, that is protocols,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.120]   in order to access the states of mind
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.480]   that will enable you to do your best possible work.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.140]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.000]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.120]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.740]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.560]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.680]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.840]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.940]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.240]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.200]   I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.740]   about the fact that quality sleep is the foundation
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.000]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.760]   And to get the best possible night's sleep,
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.520]   it's absolutely key that your sleeping surface,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.560]   that is your mattress, suit your specific needs.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.000]   Helix understands this,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   and they developed a brief two minute quiz
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   in which you can match your body type and sleep preferences.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.660]   That is whether or not you sleep on your back,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.560]   your side, or your stomach,
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.140]   whether or not you tend to run hot or cold
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.980]   in the middle of the night.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.800]   Perhaps you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.640]   That's okay.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   You answer the questions in that brief two minute quiz,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.000]   and they match you to the specific mattress
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.320]   ideal for your sleep needs.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.600]   In my case, that was the Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.040]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.360]   well over three years ago,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.800]   and it has significantly improved my sleep.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.200]   And as a consequence, I feel more focused and alert.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.240]   I'm better able to do all the things that I need to
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.480]   cognitively, physically, throughout the day.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.440]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   simply go to helixsleep.com/huberman.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.200]   Take that brief two minute quiz,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.080]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.360]   ideal for you.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.040]   You'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.620]   and two free pillows.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.520]   Again, go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.840]   for up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Maui Nui Venison.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.120]   Maui Nui Venison is the most nutrient dense
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.120]   and delicious red meat available.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.920]   I've spoken before on this podcast,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.500]   and there's general consensus
[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.440]   that most people should strive to consume
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.720]   approximately one gram of protein per pound of body weight.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.480]   Now, when one strives to do that,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.120]   it's important to maximize the quality of that protein
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.100]   intake to the calorie ratio,
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.720]   because you don't want to consume an excess of calories
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.740]   when trying to get that one gram of protein
[00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.220]   per pound of body weight.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.900]   Maui Nui Venison has an extremely high quality protein
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.860]   to calorie ratio.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.820]   So it makes getting that one gram of protein
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.940]   per pound of body weight extremely easy.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.180]   It's also delicious.
[00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.700]   Personally, I like the ground venison.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.260]   I also like the venison steaks.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.860]   And then for convenience, when I'm on the road,
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.940]   I like the jerky.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.000]   The jerky is a very high protein to calorie ratio.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.220]   So it has as much as 10 grams of protein per jerky stick,
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.580]   and it has something like only like 55 calories.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.980]   So again, making it very easy to get enough protein
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.860]   without consuming excess calories.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.060]   If you would like to try Maui Nui Venison,
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.540]   you can go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.340]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.860]   Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.340]   to get 20% off.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.100]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Juve.
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.260]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.740]   Now, if there's one theme that I've consistently put forward
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.200]   on this podcast, it's the powerful role that light has
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.640]   on our mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.360]   Juve makes medical grade devices
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.440]   that emit both red and near infrared light.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.000]   Red and near infrared light
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.520]   is so-called long wavelength light,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.000]   and it's able to penetrate deeper into tissues
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.520]   than shorter wavelength light, like blue and green lights.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.160]   Those red and near infrared long wavelength lights
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.080]   have been shown to be beneficial for everything
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.880]   from skin health, to wound healing, to eye health,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.140]   and even for mitochondrial health.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.480]   What sets Juve apart from other red light
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.200]   and near infrared light devices
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.500]   is that they are clinically proven
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.400]   to emit the specific wavelengths
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.000]   at the specific intensities required
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   to achieve specific biological effects.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.600]   Personally, I use the Juve handheld light,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.080]   both at home and when I travel.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.460]   It's only about the size of a sandwich.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.100]   It's very convenient to use.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.160]   I also have a Juve whole body panel,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.880]   and I use that about three or four times a week.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.000]   If you would like to try Juve,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.160]   you can go to joovv.com/huberman.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.920]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.640]   to all Huberman Lab listeners
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.160]   with up to $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.240]   Again, that's Juve, joovv.com/huberman
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   to get $400 off select Juve products.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.840]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Cal Newport.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.800]   Dr. Cal Newport, welcome.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.720]   - Dr. Huberman, it's good to see you.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.960]   - I'm a huge fan.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.920]   I've been a huge fan ever since I read "Deep Work."
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.040]   I can't say that I've adopted all the principles,
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.540]   but that's on me, not you.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.960]   You provide incredible incentive
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.480]   for why one ought to pursue deep work
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.100]   and slow productivity in service to high quality,
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.580]   true productivity, et cetera.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.080]   Some of the protocols, as we'll call them,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.840]   are incredibly easy to implement.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.040]   Others take some discipline.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.120]   So I'd like to talk about both sets today.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.160]   But the first question I have is, do you own a smartphone?
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.400]   - I do have a smartphone.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.480]   - Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.280]   I don't use social media.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.840]   So it turns out smartphones aren't that interesting
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.640]   if you don't have any social media apps on it.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.000]   - Yeah, what's that like?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   - So there's nothing, if you have nothing that is engineered
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.200]   that try to grab your attention,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   the smartphone actually goes back
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.200]   to 2007 Steve Jobs keynote address smartphone,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.760]   which is, this is a really nice phone.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.040]   And your music, you can listen to things on it.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.880]   And the phone interface is really good.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.200]   And look, there's a Maps app
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.000]   and you can like look at Maps on it.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.760]   Like it's actually a useful piece of technology
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   that you're happy to have, but you don't use it that much.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.000]   - What about text messaging?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.920]   Do you text message?
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.360]   And if so, do you get into conversations by text
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   or is it more of a plan and meet type tool?
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.160]   - I try, right?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.360]   So I try, I do use text messaging.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.240]   I mean, this is how like my wife gets in touch with me.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.960]   But I'm notorious somewhat among my friends
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.320]   of the ability to capture my attention
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.840]   with text message is really hit or miss
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.160]   because I'll go hours without looking at my phone.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.920]   So it's not this default appendage.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.200]   I think for a lot of people, if you know someone,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.480]   you can basically assume like, look, if I text them,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.080]   they're gonna get right back to me.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.560]   My problem is I'll go two, three, four hours
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.840]   without looking at my phone.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.920]   And then there'll be text messages on there
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.040]   from conversations that people were trying to start.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.120]   And I typically just have to declare text bankruptcy
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.240]   a few times a day.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.400]   Like if they really needed me,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.560]   I guess they would have called.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   So I do text, but I'm not considered to be very good at it.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.160]   - A few other questions about your phone practices.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.440]   - This makes me nervous.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.600]   - Is your phone in a drawer or on the desktop
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.720]   while you're working?
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.960]   Is it face down, face up?
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.800]   Is the ringer on?
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.880]   Is it off?
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.640]   - Oh, you mean if I'm writing or, it's nowhere near me.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.320]   I mean, it could be anywhere.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.600]   It's just not gonna be anywhere near me.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.840]   So I have in my house two different offices basically.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.880]   Right, so there's a home office.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.840]   The printer's there.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.080]   The filing cabinets are there.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.240]   Like the nice big monitors there.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   You can pay taxes, that type of thing.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.640]   Then I have a library.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.360]   And there's no permanent technology in the library.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.120]   No computer in there, no monitor, no printers,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.960]   nothing like this.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.840]   I have this sort of custom built desk I had made
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   by a company from Maine
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.160]   that makes desks for college libraries.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.200]   Like that's what they do.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.040]   So I have this like custom fit desk to fit into,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.720]   it's not that big of a space.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.000]   That's where I go to write.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.040]   I'm surrounded by books
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.240]   that I've really carefully curated what's where,
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.360]   each shelf, like what type of book it has on it.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.160]   So I can look different ways for different inspirations.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.640]   I got a fireplace.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.120]   So I can just turn on a fire if I need it.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920]   I'll bring my laptop in there to write
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.640]   if I'm gonna write on a computer.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.480]   And my phone doesn't come in there.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.760]   Yeah, you don't look at a phone in that room.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.600]   And it just helps you.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.640]   It's a ritual, right?
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.400]   If I'm in there, I'm thinking.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.080]   I'm creating with the sort of same patterns of cogitation
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   that we would have been using for hundreds of years
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.840]   when people have been thinking professionally.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   If I wanna be near a printer
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.560]   and I wanna go onto a web browser
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.400]   and pay my taxes or whatever,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.720]   I have a different place for that.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.360]   - I'm curious about the fireplace.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.800]   I have this theory
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.880]   based on my understanding of visual neuroscience
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.400]   and the fact that when we're looking at visual scenes
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.800]   that have some degree of predictability to them,
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.080]   we get into a mode of anticipation.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.360]   Our thinking is at least somewhat linear and so forth.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.440]   When we are looking at say ocean waves
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.320]   or in a skyscraper,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.440]   we're staring down at the street of say New York City
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.360]   and the cars are moving in obviously not random fashion,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.200]   but at least to our visual perception, pseudo random,
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.760]   you're not tracking any one thing.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.320]   The mind goes into this sort of state
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.620]   where our thoughts become non-linear.
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.840]   They're not anchored to any kind of if then
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.160]   kind of what I call DPO,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.880]   duration path outcome kind of trajectory.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.260]   There's not a lot of neuroscience on this,
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.100]   but there's a little bit.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.960]   Same thing happens when you're looking in an aquarium,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.800]   by the way.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.360]   So I wonder whether or not staring at the fire,
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.200]   which is something that humans have been doing
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.620]   for many, many, many thousands of years,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.620]   because it has that random aspect to it,
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.840]   does it tend to spark creativity, linear thinking?
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.200]   At what point in your writing do you turn to the fire
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.680]   and stare at it?
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.960]   - That's interesting actually
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.120]   that there's a neurological explanation.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.760]   When I use the fire is actually when I read, right?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.260]   So I have chairs by the fire,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.620]   but I think for exactly this reason, right?
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.740]   Because when I'm reading, I'm looking to spark ideas, right?
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.900]   Like, okay, what's my takeaway from this?
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.100]   What's the connection you're making
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.660]   between this thing you're reading here
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.860]   and this idea over there?
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.420]   That type of connection making is a lot of my brainstorming.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.380]   I read by the fire when the weather allows it.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.960]   I also walk a lot.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.660]   So I wonder if there's something similar going on.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.340]   Like when I'm trying to work through an idea
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.760]   for an article or a math proof or something like this,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.100]   almost always I'm gonna do that on foot.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.480]   And there might be something similar going on there
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.160]   where you're encountering,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.400]   it's not entirely exotic stimuli, right?
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.120]   So it's not, oh my God, my attention's being drawn,
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.400]   but it's you don't quite know what you're gonna see.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.040]   And you also have that circuit quieting effect
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.180]   of the walk-ins, your motor neurons are going.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.560]   You can tell me if I'm getting this right or not.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.400]   - You are, yeah, absolutely.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.360]   - The motor neurons are going
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.640]   and you get some inhibition going on
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.000]   in some of these key networks,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.140]   which allows you to actually maintain the internal focus
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.840]   on a concept a little bit better.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.260]   So I do a lot of my original focused ideating on foot,
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.300]   but a lot of my serendipitous ideating
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.060]   will be with the fire going, right?
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.460]   It's the way I read by the fire.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.340]   It's when I read that I get a lot of my original ideas.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.060]   - I have this theory that the two opposite states of mind
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.860]   that both facilitate creativity and productivity
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.940]   look something like this.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.540]   And you can tell me whether or not this maps
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.420]   to anything that you know.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.620]   One is just as you described, our body is in motion.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.700]   It could be running, walking,
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.960]   might even be in the shower or something of that sort.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.040]   But we aren't trying to direct our mind
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.740]   toward a specific linear trajectory or outcome.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.320]   It's not like working out an equation or a theorem
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.800]   the same way we would if we were at a piece of paper
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.540]   or writing out a sentence, a structured paragraph.
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.040]   So it's body in motion, mind not channeled
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.460]   toward one specific target.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.460]   The opposite extreme to me is body still, mind very active,
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.540]   which resembles rapid eye movement,
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.420]   sleep when we learn a lot
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.220]   and neural rewiring occurs and dreaming,
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.300]   but for which there's also a lot of examples
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.860]   of very accomplished creatives using that sort of thing
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.500]   of meditative like approaches,
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   forcing oneself to be still and thinking.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.500]   So it sounds like you incorporate both.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.660]   And I'm curious as a computer scientist
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.260]   who writes code, does theorems, does a lot of math
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.180]   where you can't just kind of wing it,
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.860]   there's a right and wrong answer involved.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.260]   What is your mode for sitting down
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.500]   and working through something that's linear and hard?
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.740]   - Yeah, it's interesting the way you talk about it, right?
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.300]   Because when I'm walking,
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.660]   and this is actually something you can train,
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.420]   and I talked about this in one of my books once,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.500]   that you can actually train yourself
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.100]   to maintain your internal eye of focus
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.660]   more stably while you're walking, right?
[00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.540]   So I call this productive meditation
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.880]   and deep work actually.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.820]   And I practiced this in grad school, right?
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.580]   Okay, so I'm going to work on a particular problem
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.340]   while I walk, and then you actually practice
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.620]   bringing your attention back to the central problem.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.340]   And I don't know exactly what's happening,
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.580]   but you get a little bit more facility
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:12.900]   working with your working memory,
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.180]   a little bit more efficiency with bringing stuff
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.620]   in and out of the working memory.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.940]   And so I trained myself that I could actually
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940]   write a couple paragraphs in my head,
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.100]   maybe not word for, but basically word for word,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.360]   like figure out how I'm going to do it,
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.420]   or figure out enough steps of a math proof
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.740]   to capture like a key insight.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.420]   Like, okay, now I'm going to get around this.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.380]   Then you have to sit down
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.500]   and actually formally capture that.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.300]   And yeah, for me, that's still working with notebooks.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.780]   Though when I was coming up in grad school,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.700]   and I was just excavating these thoughts recently,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.820]   we were talking for the, we recorded that, you know,
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.900]   I just wrote this essay about what I learned
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.020]   as a grad student that impacted all my writing.
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.340]   As a grad student in the theory group at MIT,
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.980]   which was just purified concentration,
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.980]   this is where all the deep work ideas come from, right?
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.900]   I mean, it was just world-class concentrators.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.180]   There, the method was very still,
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.220]   more than one person, whiteboard.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.500]   So if you have two or three people
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.180]   staring at the same whiteboard,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.380]   you're actually going to up the level
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.840]   of concentration you achieve,
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.700]   because if you let your attention wander,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.420]   you disengage that attention,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.020]   there's a social capital cost.
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.460]   'Cause now I've fallen out
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.580]   of the whiteboard effect discussion,
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.780]   that's going to be a problem.
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.180]   So you actually maintain your focus at a higher level.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.500]   And then when someone else is making their move,
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.220]   okay, you know, what about this?
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.740]   And they're working math, it's all math on the board.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.900]   You're giving that the highest attention you're capable of
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.540]   because you want to keep up, right?
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.660]   You don't want to fall behind.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.340]   So it was like this hack that was figured out
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.020]   in the theory group, that if you put two or three people
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.540]   at the same whiteboard to try to alchemize these insights
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.020]   into actual mathematically precise proofs,
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:50.020]   you get a 20, 30% boost in your concentration level.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.380]   And that could make all the difference, right?
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.860]   If you're working on a very hard proof,
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.540]   20, 30% boost could be the difference
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.100]   between solving it or not.
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.340]   - In one of these situations
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.580]   where you're at the whiteboard or chalkboard
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.460]   and there are two other individuals facing it,
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.540]   are they interrupting you?
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.060]   Or is the etiquette in that scenario
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.820]   to just let the person go until their natural inclination
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.060]   to raise a hand and scream help?
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.300]   - Whoever has the marker on the board,
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.540]   they're the ones talking.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.020]   So you go, "Okay, what about this?" you say.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.460]   And now you're working, you're writing down equations
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.260]   or drawing your diagram and everyone is just watching.
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.260]   And then when they're done,
[00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.100]   then everyone steps back and looks at it.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.940]   Then you can step forward.
[00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.980]   "Okay, but what if we did this?"
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.140]   And then you still work on it.
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.900]   So when I got built some offices
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.660]   or worked out some offices near my house,
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.380]   like one of the first things we put in there
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.460]   was a whiteboard.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.620]   So they could have computer science collaborators come
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.340]   because we can't work on theory otherwise.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.860]   Like it is the thing we need is a whiteboard, right?
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.680]   When I started grad school,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.540]   they had just built this new $300 million
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.620]   Frank Gehry design building for the computer science,
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.820]   artificial intelligence laboratory and the linguistics.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.620]   Half of it was computer science.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.820]   - I know those buildings 'cause the P. Cower
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.900]   and the McGovern Neuroscience Center.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.340]   And those buildings are very interesting.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.100]   People should check them out if they're ever in Cambridge.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.420]   - Yeah, the-- - Kendall Square Stop.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.480]   - The Stata Center, yeah.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.500]   Right down the street from the Kendall Square Stop, yeah.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.340]   So the sixth floor was where the theoreticians were.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.700]   This is where I was.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.940]   So I, you know, they opened that building
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.460]   the year I started the doctoral program.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.740]   And what did they wanna show me
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.100]   when they brought me to this $300 million building?
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.500]   Look at our whiteboards.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.460]   And that's what they were proud of.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.580]   They had filled the common space on the sixth floor,
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.300]   the theory floor with these freestanding,
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.700]   double-sided whiteboards.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.140]   It was like a maze of whiteboards.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.500]   And this is what everyone was so excited about
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.800]   was, yeah, look at our whiteboard coverage.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.780]   Surrounded by a $300 million building.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.140]   I was trying to explain this to someone recently.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.460]   Having good whiteboards to us is like an astronomer
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.500]   saying, look, we got this great radio telescope.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.980]   Like, this is gonna allow us to get data to work on
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.620]   that we wouldn't otherwise have access to.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.500]   I think to a theoretician,
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.860]   that's why you see a whiteboard.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.420]   Because, you know, if you wanna think
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.220]   at the very highest level,
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.580]   you need two or three people staring at the same thing,
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.040]   taking turns with the marker,
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.620]   pushing each other past where they're comfortable.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.140]   - I love this 'cause I often think about visual maps
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.800]   that represent our internal memory stores and plans,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.580]   et cetera, for productivity.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.720]   I've always relied heavily on the whiteboard.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.900]   Getting one for home, I have one here in the podcast studio.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.000]   All of my podcast notes for my solo episodes
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.420]   are distilled down to four eight and a half by 11 notes,
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.220]   which are photographs of the whiteboard.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.220]   And I don't use a teleprompter.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.940]   That's why I've been accused of using one before.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.620]   I don't even know how that would work.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.980]   But it's extremely useful to use the whiteboard.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.340]   And I think because ideas are so easily put up there
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.340]   and removed, there's something about writing on things
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.360]   that are vertical as opposed to on a flat surface.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.280]   Because that's actually the way
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.960]   our visual perception casts things.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.400]   We don't cast visual perception onto the ground.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.840]   We experience the visual world mostly in front of us.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.120]   I think the cognitive map and the visual map
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.000]   are inextricably linked, at least for sighted folks.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.200]   So I think there's really something there.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.660]   - So in the absence of colleagues to sit there
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.660]   and boost our attention by 25 to 30%, what could one do?
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.140]   Do you have a, you said you have a whiteboard at home.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.160]   I certainly use the whiteboard.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.960]   Do you work on it the same way you would
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.080]   in those early days,
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.040]   just with in the absence of colleagues looking on?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:25.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.940]   So you work on it just like someone's there.
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.360]   The other hack is using really good notebooks.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.420]   That's always made a big difference for me.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.480]   - Paper notebooks. - Paper notebooks, yeah.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.320]   Though recently I've been messing around with a Remarkable,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.960]   which is one of these digital notebooks
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.640]   where it's e-ink technology.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   So it's like a Kindle, but you can write on it,
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.920]   but you have endless pages on it.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.100]   So I've been messing around with that recently.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.820]   But I remembered when I was a postdoc, for example,
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.080]   I found it recently.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.240]   I went and bought a lab notebook
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.280]   because those are expensive, at least for a postdoc, right?
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.560]   They're like $70 because a lab notebook
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.240]   has to have archival quality paper.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.600]   - It's bound. - It's bound.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.640]   - Yeah, people might not realize this.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.800]   Lab notebooks need to be kept for many years.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.640]   - Yes.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.040]   - So you're not supposed to tear pages out of them.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.520]   And so they tend to be bound.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.480]   So if you have terrible handwriting like I do,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.600]   you just have to deal with it.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.800]   - Yes, you can't rip it out.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.880]   And it's thick paper, acid-free archival paper,
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.720]   big, sturdy covers.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   But I bought this because I thought,
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.560]   "Okay, look, I'm gonna take it more seriously."
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.280]   Because I think that's also part of what goes on
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.480]   with the whiteboard is your mind thinks about writing
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.200]   on the big vertical space
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.720]   as a public crystallization of thoughts.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.480]   I'm putting this up for people to see,
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.200]   even if there's no one actually there to see it.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.120]   And so you take it more seriously, right?
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.440]   If I'm writing on a whiteboard in class,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.640]   I'm not just gonna put up nonsense.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   Like I'm gonna be very careful about what I'm writing
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.280]   because you imagine there's an audience.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   This is something for other people to see.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.040]   And so you get a little bit of a similar effect
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.280]   if you have a very nice notebook.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.440]   You think, "Look, I don't wanna waste pages."
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.880]   And somehow that helps with the thinking.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.360]   So then I found this notebook
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.480]   because I store my old notebooks in my closet.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.520]   So I found it when I was working on a recent book.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.640]   I found it, I went through it, right?
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.960]   And then I started ticking off,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.760]   this turned into a paper, this turned into a grant.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.800]   This notebook, I used it for maybe two years,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.240]   only used maybe about half the pages.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.840]   It's all very careful, neat script and diagrams.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.600]   I think I found seven different peer-reviewed papers
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.560]   or funded grants where the core ideas were in this notebook.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.360]   So it's like that $70 was an incredible investment
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.240]   because when I got to work in that notebook,
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.000]   it must have been pushing my thinking to a new level
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.760]   because it was an incredible concentration
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.960]   of actual publishable results
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.880]   were coming out of his pages.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.320]   - Yeah, it seems like we would all do well,
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.480]   regardless of our field,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.360]   to have some very low bar method of capture,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   where if we just have an idea
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.720]   that spontaneously comes to mind,
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.560]   that we can capture that in a voice memo
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.080]   or dare I say, in a phone notes segment.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.080]   But then something, as you're suggesting,
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.640]   like a whiteboard, like a bound notebook,
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.840]   where the moment we look at it,
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.400]   it brings about a level of seriousness
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.080]   to our thinking and to our actions.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.960]   Sort of like this is different than just texting.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.560]   I mean, what we're really talking about
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.880]   are kind of layers of sophistication,
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.200]   but not in a snobby way,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.880]   in terms of highest productivity and quality
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.480]   to kind of, I don't know, bubble gum wrapper
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   on the floor type levels of quote unquote productivity.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.120]   - Well, I mean, I've become a fan of this idea
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.480]   of having specialized capture for specific type of work.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.200]   So for example, I'm a big believer
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.760]   in pretty quickly you wanna capture ideas
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.160]   in the tool you use to do that work.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.320]   So when I have ideas for an article or a book,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.760]   I'm gonna go write the Scrivener,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.920]   which is a specialty,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   this is a specialty software writers use to write, right?
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.920]   I'm gonna go write to a Scrivener project
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.400]   and start putting these in the research section
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.800]   of that Scrivener project.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.920]   When I'm working on a math or computer science thing,
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.080]   I might work out proof ideas on paper,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.480]   but I pretty quickly wanna get that into a LaTeX document.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.680]   So the markup language that you use
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.440]   for doing sort of like applied math papers, right?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.680]   The tool we use to actually write papers.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.000]   I'm gonna move an idea into there as soon as I can.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.360]   I'm gonna move proofs out of a notebook
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.440]   and into formally marked up like you would for a paper,
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.200]   you know, as soon as I would.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.520]   So this idea, this is something I've been leaning to more
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.720]   is capture the notes in the tool you're gonna use,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.400]   take out the middleman in some sense, right?
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.560]   So it's reducing friction,
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.240]   but also puts you in the right mind space.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   Like, okay, this idea, I'm gonna put it
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.880]   where I'm gonna need it later,
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   as opposed to a more elaborate third-party system
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.200]   that you construct
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.920]   that you then later pull everything out of as needed.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.080]   This is what I've been doing more recently.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.280]   Let's just get straight to the tool
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.440]   I'm eventually gonna use
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.080]   with maybe a high quality notebook intermediary
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.600]   if I'm actually literally working out thoughts.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   So math, you have to work out thoughts,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   but I'll get that into an actual paper format
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.440]   pretty quickly.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.560]   - Tell me what you think of this,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.680]   what I always call protocol.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   If I wanna learn something from a manuscript I read
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.720]   or a book chapter, I used to highlight things.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.400]   And I had a very elaborate,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.200]   extracted from my university days,
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.720]   system of stars and exclamation marks and underline
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.680]   that mean a lot to me that can, yes,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.560]   bring me back to a given segment within the chapter.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.740]   But a few years ago, I was teaching a course
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.740]   in the biology department at Stanford.
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.920]   And for some reason, we had them read a study
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.840]   about information retention.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.880]   And I learned from that study
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.520]   that one of the best things we can do is read information
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.440]   in whatever form, a magazine, research article, et cetera,
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.720]   book, and then to take some time away from that material,
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.200]   maybe walk, maybe close one's eyes,
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.600]   maybe leave them open, doesn't matter.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.760]   And just try and remember specific elements.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.120]   How much does one remember?
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.880]   Then go back to the material and look at it.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.200]   And I've just been positively astonished
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.120]   at how much more information I can learn
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.200]   when I'm not simply going through motor commands
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.800]   of just underlining things and highlighting them,
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.700]   but stepping away and thinking, okay,
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.240]   yeah, I don't remember how many subjects there were.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.960]   I'll go back and check that, maybe make a note.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.240]   And okay, they did this, then they did that.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.480]   And then it's crystallized.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.000]   And when, as I say this,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.840]   I realize of course this should work.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.800]   This is the way that the brain learns,
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.000]   but somehow that's not the way we are taught to learn.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.480]   - Yeah, well, I'm smiling because when I was 22,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.280]   I wrote this book called "How to Become a Straight A Student."
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.240]   And the whole premise of the book was
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.760]   I'm gonna talk to actual college students
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.640]   who have straight A's and who don't seem
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.360]   completely ground out, like not burnt out.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.800]   And I'm just gonna interview them.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.880]   And the protocol was how did you study
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.100]   for the last test did you study for?
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.200]   How did you take notes for the last?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.760]   So I was just asking them to walk through their methodology.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.880]   The core idea of that book was active recall.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.320]   That was the core idea, that replicating ideas,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.480]   ways to say is replicating the information from scratch
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.000]   as if teaching a class without looking at your notes.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.920]   That is the only way to learn.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.400]   And the thing about it was it's a trade-off.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.600]   It doesn't take, it's efficient, doesn't take much time,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.720]   but it's incredibly mentally taxing, right?
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.000]   This is why students often avoid it.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.460]   It is difficult to sit there and try to replicate
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.900]   and pull forth, okay, what did I read here?
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:17.740]   How did that work?
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:21.180]   It's mentally very taxing, but it's very time-efficient.
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.560]   If you're willing to essentially put up with that pain,
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.460]   you learn very quickly.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.700]   And not only do you learn very quickly, you don't forget.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.940]   It's almost like you have a pseudo-photographic memory
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.780]   when you study this way.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.740]   You sit down to do a test and you're replicating
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:36.940]   whole lines from what you studied.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.500]   The ideas sort of come out fully formed
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.720]   'cause it's such a fantastic way to actually learn.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   It was my key.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.240]   Like the whole premise that got me writing that book
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.680]   is I went through this period as a college student
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.840]   where I came in freshman year, was like a fine student.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.540]   Not a great student, but a fine student.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:57.960]   And I was rowing crew and I was sort of like
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.280]   excited to do that.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.440]   And then I developed a heart condition
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   and had to stop congenital wiring in the heart,
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.840]   atrial flutter thing.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.040]   It meant I couldn't row crew anymore.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.520]   - Is that prolapse of some sort?
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.840]   - It was a circuitry issue that would lead
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.720]   to an extremely rapid heartbeat.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.240]   It's like a really rapid, like tachardia, right?
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.260]   You get 250 beats a minute just,
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.180]   and it could be exercise induced, right?
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.560]   Which is not optimal.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.400]   You could take beta blockers,
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.160]   which would moderate the electrical timing,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.000]   but beta blockers reduce your max heart rate.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.860]   And if you're an athlete where the entire thing
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.400]   that matters is your max heart rate,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.000]   so you're doing something like 2,000 meter rows,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.600]   your performance on beta blockers just goes down.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.440]   It makes no sense.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.280]   It's like being a basketball player
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.340]   that wears weighted shoes.
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.180]   It's too frustrating.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.060]   - Right, it also makes you super mellow.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.500]   - I was pretty mellow, but I was a worse rower.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.100]   So I stopped that.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.120]   I was like, okay, I want to get serious about my studies.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.380]   I started to get serious about my studies in writing, right?
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:56.060]   That's when I actually made the decisions
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:59.620]   that I'd been stuck with for the next 25 years after that.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.040]   But one of the things I did to get serious about my studies
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.340]   is I said, I'm going to systematically experiment
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.100]   with how to study for tests and how to write papers.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.580]   And I would try this.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.420]   How did it go?
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.340]   Deconstruct experiment.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.180]   Try this.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.000]   How did it go?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.840]   Deconstruct experiment.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.580]   And active recall was the thing to turn me all around.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.160]   And so I went from a pretty good student
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.580]   to 4.0 every single quarter,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.900]   sophomore year, junior year, senior year.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.620]   I got one A minus between my sophomore year
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.580]   through my senior year.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.260]   It was like this miraculous transformation.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.420]   It was active recall.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:31.900]   I rebuilt all of my studies.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.880]   So if it was for a humanities class,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.220]   I had a whole way of taking notes.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.980]   It was all built around doing active recall.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.340]   For math classes, my main study tool
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.260]   was a stack of white paper.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.700]   All right, do this proof, white piece of paper.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.680]   And just, can I do it from scratch?
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.180]   If I could, I know that technique.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.700]   If I don't, all right, I'm going to come back
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.540]   and try it again later.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.060]   Completely transformed.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.220]   I did so well academically,
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.100]   that's why I ended up writing that book
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.900]   that basically spread that message to other people.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.380]   So I'm a huge advocate for active recall.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.940]   It's really hard, but it is the way to learn new things.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.300]   - I'd like to take a brief moment
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.580]   and thank one of our sponsors,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.220]   and that's AG1.
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.860]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.140]   that also contains adaptogens.
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.260]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.500]   The reason I started taking it
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.300]   and the reason I still take it every day
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.680]   is that it ensures that I meet all of my quotas
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.460]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.320]   And it ensures that I get enough prebiotic and probiotic
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.840]   to support gut health.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.300]   Now, gut health is something that over the last 10 years,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.280]   we realized is not just important
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.940]   for the health of our gut,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.100]   but also for our immune system
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.260]   and for the production of neurotransmitters
[00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.820]   and neuromodulators, things like dopamine and serotonin.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.780]   In other words, gut health is critical
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.660]   for proper brain functioning.
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.340]   Now, of course I strive to consume healthy whole foods
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.780]   for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day,
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.740]   but there are a number of things in AG1
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.420]   including specific micronutrients
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.980]   that are hard to get from whole foods
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.860]   or at least in sufficient quantities.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.280]   So AG1 allows me to get the vitamins and minerals
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.060]   that I need, probiotics, prebiotics, the adaptogens
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.060]   and critical micronutrients.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.620]   So anytime somebody asks me
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.780]   if they were to take just one supplement,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.900]   what that supplement should be, I tell them AG1
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.220]   because AG1 supports so many different systems
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.400]   within the body that are involved in mental health,
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.020]   physical health and performance.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.920]   To try AG1, go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.060]   and you'll get a year supply of vitamin D3K2
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.180]   and five free travel packs of AG1.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.140]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.180]   - And as you pointed out, it is very time efficient.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.300]   - Oh yeah.
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.700]   I mean, it was a problem.
[00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.780]   It was a social problem for me
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.780]   that I would have to pretend during finals period
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.860]   that I was going to the library to study
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.380]   because I would be done studying.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.940]   This active recall, it's brutal,
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.100]   but it's incredibly efficient.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.020]   You sit down there, I would have my cards.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.860]   I would mark it.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.300]   Okay, I struggled with this.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.700]   I'd put it in this pile.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.660]   I got it done, I'd put it in this pile.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.120]   And so then you would just go back
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.900]   to the I struggled with it pile and work on that
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.380]   and then make a new I struggled with a pile.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.460]   And these would exponentially decay.
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.300]   And so in like a few hours, you could really master,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.860]   you know, with a few other tricks that worked,
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.660]   you could really master the material pretty quickly.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.620]   And then what am I supposed to do?
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.060]   I didn't do all-nighters.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.900]   You don't want to make any sense.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.460]   Like active recall is how you prepare.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.580]   It's going to take four hours and it's going to be tough.
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.060]   So do it in the morning when you have energy
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.700]   and then you're done.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.540]   - I love it.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.460]   I learned essentially all of neuroanatomy
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.260]   looking down the microscope at tissue samples.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.020]   And then I would try and take photographs with my eyes.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.460]   I do not have a photographic memory,
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.300]   but then I would get home in the evening,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.480]   look through the neuroanatomy textbook,
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.580]   lie down and try and fly through
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.260]   the different circuits in my mind.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.440]   And then if I arrived at a structure in the brain
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.140]   that I couldn't identify,
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.660]   I would then go check my notes and go back.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.700]   So basically I learned neuroanatomy, which I, you know,
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.180]   I'm poor at a great many things in life,
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.600]   but neuroanatomy I'm solid at.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.700]   And then some, if I may say so.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.660]   And it's because there's a mental map.
[00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.020]   You can't move through it, you know,
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:02.260]   fly through it dynamically and that it's the same process.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.160]   Not all things lend themselves to that approach.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.860]   I'm guessing maybe we could think of a few that don't.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.820]   I guess if people were learning music,
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.060]   that might be tricky.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.660]   Maybe they need the sheet music in front of them.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.100]   I don't know, I'm not a musician.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:16.940]   - Yeah.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.900]   I mean, I studied a professional guitar player at one point.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:20.740]   - You were a professional guitar player?
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.060]   - No, I studied one.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:22.900]   - Oh.
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.620]   - So for a book, everything's from some book.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.460]   I've written a lot of books.
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.540]   So I wrote a book 10 years ago
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:29.100]   where I was trying to figure out as part of it,
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.460]   how do people get better at things?
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.460]   And so I spent time with a professional guitar player
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.120]   that said, I just wanted to see how he practiced.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.540]   Like, what does this actually look like?
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.860]   And what I learned from them is like,
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.100]   what they do is, yeah,
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.340]   they have the music in front of them,
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.260]   but for them it's all speed.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.780]   So they take a piece, he was working on licks for,
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.580]   he was a new acoustic style player
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.980]   and they had these kind of bluegrassy type licks.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.940]   And he probably had it memorized
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:52.820]   and he knew how fast he could comfortably play it.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.500]   For them, it's all about adding 20%
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.100]   to what they're comfortably doing.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.500]   And then that push passed where they're comfortable.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500]   And the thing I remember writing about him
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.380]   was he was concentrating so hard
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.660]   to try to hit this lick 20% faster than he was used to it,
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.100]   is that he'd forget to breathe.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.420]   So he'd be like going, going, going,
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.820]   and then just gasp, you know?
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:12.980]   Like, 'cause his body would, you know,
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.660]   force him to breathe.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.620]   So yeah, there it seemed to be all about deliberate practice.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.500]   So like, how do you,
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.860]   they don't waste any time, professional musicians
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.500]   waste no time doing things they're comfortable doing.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.060]   Every time they spend practicing,
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.620]   and this is also incredibly difficult,
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.940]   but every time they spend practicing
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.380]   is almost entirely in a state of,
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.660]   I'm not comfortable with this.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.500]   But if I focus as hard as I can,
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.180]   maybe I'm gonna pull this off.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.940]   Like I'll pull off the sonata
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.320]   at this new speed I'm trying to do.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.920]   Maybe I'll pull it off.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.620]   It's like the maximal growth stimulating state.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.660]   And so I wrote in this chapter,
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.380]   why was he so much better at guitar
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.500]   than I was at the same age?
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.020]   'Cause I played a lot of guitar when I was younger
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.820]   and was in rock bands, right?
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.100]   And this kid was young, right?
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.700]   But really, really good.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.180]   And I said, okay, now I realize it.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.740]   I can recognize me when I look back at my time
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.780]   playing guitar at his age.
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.580]   I played stuff I knew how to play.
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.620]   Like, that's what was fun.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.180]   Like, yeah, I wanna like jam along with the songs I knew,
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.420]   or, you know, rip some pentatonic scales, you know,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.480]   to like a Jimi Hendrix album.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.860]   It was fun.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.980]   And he spent almost no time,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:17.740]   the pro spent no time having fun.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.740]   Practicing was your brain had to be, you know, uncomfortable.
[00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.060]   So I learned a lot from that, you know.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.820]   This actually led to a bit of a battle
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.220]   because of my readers,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:31.660]   there was this battle that emerged
[00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.900]   where people were trying to combine Anders Ericsson
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.420]   and deliberate practice
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.820]   with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and flow.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.980]   And really they were trying to make flow apply everywhere.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.660]   Like it's all about flow, deliberate practices, flow,
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.480]   everything is flow.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.180]   The whole thing is to get into a state of flow.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.780]   And I remember Anders talking about this at some point
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.620]   and saying like, no, no, no.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.040]   Like the state of practice that makes you better.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.100]   It's the opposite of flow, right?
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.020]   In flow, you lose track of time.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.660]   When you're practicing like that professional guitar player,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.900]   you know, every second it passes by
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.720]   because it's like incredibly difficult.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.060]   Like what you're doing, your mind is rebelling.
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.260]   It's not natural.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.540]   You know, it's not fun.
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.740]   It's not the skier going down the hill
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.780]   and it's all instinct.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.120]   It's all you thinking about exactly
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.140]   what you're trying to do.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.980]   And so, you know, I began to push this point out here.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.380]   It's like, it's not all about flow.
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.820]   Like actually getting better at things
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.040]   is really painful sometimes.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.340]   Deliberate practice is not the same as flow.
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.700]   And there was a lot of fights about this for a while.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.400]   I think there was a lot of flow advocates
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.660]   that just wanted life to be flow all the time.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.140]   But I think Anders was right
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.380]   because I watched these professionals practice.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.860]   Like that's what it is.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:37.780]   It's not fun.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.820]   - Well, everything we know about neuroplasticity,
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.620]   which of course is the nervous system's ability
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.900]   to change in response to experience,
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:47.980]   says that there needs to be some neurochemical
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:52.540]   or electrical condition that changes in the nervous system
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.380]   in order to cue up plasticity.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:59.100]   And to my knowledge, one of the most robust of those
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.380]   is the release of the so-called catecholamines,
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.660]   dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.740]   Dopamine, because it's involved in so many things,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.020]   can be a little bit of a distractor.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.060]   So let's just say epinephrine, norepinephrine,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.780]   adrenaline, noradrenaline, create in the body
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.920]   and mind to some extent, a state of alertness
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.900]   and often a state of agitation.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.200]   But if you think about it,
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.580]   in the absence of some neuromodulators like those
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.420]   that change the conditions for wiring of neurons,
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.980]   you know, everyone loves fire together, wire together.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.500]   A beautiful statement by Carla Schatz, not Donald Hebb.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.700]   Dr. Carla Schatz said that, not Donald Hebb.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.780]   But why would neurons need to change
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.000]   their patterns of connectivity
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.820]   if you can complete the operation?
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.900]   The nervous system needs to, it doesn't feel discomfort,
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.300]   it creates discomfort, but the nervous system needs a cue
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.860]   to like, okay, this is different, I'm failing.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.520]   And it's the failures that actually trigger the plasticity.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.260]   It's the discomfort that cues
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.480]   that conditions are different now.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.060]   Otherwise there's simply no reason
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.100]   to devote energetic resources to rewiring neurons.
[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.580]   And I feel like we don't learn this when we're kids.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.480]   We, and I think as kids, we can learn so much
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.300]   without that feeling of agitation.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.220]   We get into these modes of looking for flow
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.820]   and I have respect for the research on flow
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.820]   and the people who are involved in it,
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.220]   but I'd like to talk about flow a little bit.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.980]   The only thing I really know about flow for sure
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.900]   is that backwards it spells wolf.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.020]   So what of flow?
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.540]   It's such an attractive idea, right?
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.500]   It's like Star Wars.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.060]   It's like you have the force and you're kind of,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.940]   you're doing things without thinking and awesome,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.340]   but I can't flow myself through a paper
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.520]   and extract the critical data.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.900]   I can't create a podcast in flow,
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.420]   but when it's done, it feels great,
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.340]   especially if you nail the key metrics.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.980]   So what do you think about flow?
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.100]   I'm not trying to beat up on it.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.740]   I just want to understand how you place it
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.860]   in the framework of learning and deep work,
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:54.900]   if it belongs there at all.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   - It doesn't have a big place in it,
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.020]   in the deep work framework.
[00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.060]   And this was what the controversy was for a while.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.220]   And I knew Mahaley a little bit.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.460]   Like we corresponded some and I knew Anders a little bit,
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:05.340]   like we corresponded some.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.520]   So I sort of felt like I was, you know,
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.080]   and both of them actually tragically have died
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.680]   in the last three or four years, I think.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.300]   - Oh, that's very sad.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.000]   - Yeah, I think both recently.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.560]   Flow doesn't play a big role
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.040]   in the deep work framework, right?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.680]   So when I was trying to justify deep work,
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.960]   so why focusing without distraction was important,
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.320]   I was drawing a lot more for Anders' work, right?
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.920]   Because why is focusing without distraction important?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   Well, you have to quiet the neural circuitry
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.980]   so you can isolate the circuit that's actually relevant
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.800]   to the thing that you're doing, right?
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.700]   You're not gonna get better at something
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.420]   if you have noisy circuitry.
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.020]   And that requires a really intense concentration.
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.560]   So it was one of the big advantages of deep work
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.560]   was if you're used to that cognitive state,
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.620]   you're gonna learn things faster.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.940]   And I think it was all Anders to understand why.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.100]   So if you're not distracted,
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.460]   I'm really focusing hard on what I'm doing,
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.140]   trying to learn this new thing,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.100]   you're giving the right mental conditions.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:39:59.940]   But it's not a flow state.
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:00.780]   And I always used to say,
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.540]   okay, when your deep work is not flow,
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.080]   because of this, like a lot of deep work
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.560]   is you're trying to do something
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.000]   that is beyond your comfort zone,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.120]   and that's gonna be difficult.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.960]   That's a state of deliberate practice.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.160]   And there's a famous paper about this,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.220]   where Anders actually explicitly says,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.720]   "Deliberate practice and flow are very different."
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:21.320]   And I wrote an essay years ago
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.160]   called "The Father of Deliberate Practice Disowns Flow."
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.920]   And again, people are really flow partisans out there.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.760]   It's interesting.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.040]   I think people just like the idea 'cause it feels good.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.700]   But I mean, flow is the feeling of performance
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.540]   is the way I think about it.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.540]   Like it's really hard to train for certain sports.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.100]   But then when you're actually performing,
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.980]   you're in the game, you can fall in the flow, right?
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:43.100]   Because then everything is under,
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.620]   and it's really hard to train guitar,
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.460]   but like when you're performing in front of a big crowd,
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.860]   you probably, maybe you fall in the flow.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.220]   Maybe you don't, but you could, right?
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.120]   But it's the performance state,
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.700]   not the practicing getting better state.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   So to me, flow has like very little role
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.440]   in how I think about what I do as a cognitive professional.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.400]   It's just not something that comes up that often.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.540]   - I agree that we learn through focused work
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.540]   and that flow does manifest itself during performance.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:17.700]   And sometimes so much so that people exhibit virtuosity,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.020]   surprising themselves even at what's in there.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.380]   And that's kind of, I always think of it,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.620]   it's a what is unskilled, skilled mastery virtuosity.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.340]   Virtuosity seems to incorporate some sort of random elements
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.280]   of maybe even the performer has not done that before
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.720]   and they surprised themselves or something like that.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.560]   Who knows?
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.180]   These are words for something
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.000]   that isn't easily quantified in the first place.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.080]   But in terms of deep work and getting a little bit back
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.480]   to kind of practical steps towards deep work,
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.060]   I also have to ask you, 'cause I didn't earlier,
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.400]   when you are on your laptop in your library
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.960]   with your fireplace and these books,
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.280]   it's a beautiful image, actually,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.600]   that you've drawn for us in our minds,
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.040]   is the Wi-Fi connection to your computer activated
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.060]   or are you offline?
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.560]   - It's connected because it doesn't really matter to me,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.340]   because what's drawing my attention?
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.820]   I mean, the most important decision I think I made,
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.340]   technically speaking, to be a cognitive worker
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.560]   is the lack of social media.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.020]   Like, I think we underestimate the degree
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.600]   to which our problem with digital distraction
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.100]   is not the internet, it's not our phones.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.920]   It is specific products and services
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.300]   that are engineered at great expense
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.500]   to pull you back to them.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.340]   When you take that away,
[00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.180]   the internet's not that interesting.
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:36.020]   Like, I don't have a cycle of sites to go to.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.600]   You know, I can check my email,
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.020]   but I don't really know where else to go.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.480]   I mean, I could go to the New York Times, I guess,
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.740]   but then you've seen the articles, right?
[00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.420]   They change it once a day.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.500]   There's just not much.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.840]   I've set things up, so there's not much
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.340]   that's that interesting to me.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:52.560]   - We've all heard of FOMO, fear of missing out.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.640]   I feel like there's the other thing,
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.080]   which is fear of missing something bad, right?
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.200]   That's sort of like an anxiety,
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.880]   a more primitive anxiety within us,
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.240]   that if we are not engaged on social media
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.480]   or looking at our phone often or texting often,
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.260]   that it's not that we'll miss the party,
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.560]   we'll miss the emergency.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.920]   You don't seem to suffer from those kind of everyday ills.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   - Yeah, I mean, it doesn't happen that much.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.800]   I mean, I have a phone, you know.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.000]   - A standard.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   - No, I mean, I have my phone.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.200]   I guess if I'm working away from it,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.240]   yeah, I guess it's true if there was an emergency.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.520]   But this was the case for a very long time, right?
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.440]   We didn't have smartphones till really relatively recently.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.760]   This is, you know, 15 years ago.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.860]   So we were just used to this until yesterday, essentially,
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.520]   that there's just periods of time where you're out of touch.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.600]   Like you're at a restaurant with someone,
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.280]   you're out of touch until you get back to your office.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.200]   Like we were okay.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.100]   You know, we weren't plagued by emergencies
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.440]   that led to disastrous results
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.800]   because we couldn't hear about it, right?
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.540]   Then you go to the movies, like you're out of touch, right?
[00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.560]   And be a couple hours till you're in touch again.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.880]   And so I don't, you know,
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.760]   it's not something that's affected me as much.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.960]   So maybe I'm working without my phone nearby.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.360]   A lot of people have this response.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.880]   They begin sort of catastrophizing.
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.400]   Like what if this happens or this or that?
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.960]   And I'm thinking, you know, I survived before that.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.320]   My parents survived without that.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.320]   My grandparents survived without that.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.160]   I don't worry about it as much, you know.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.080]   And some of this maybe is just,
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.320]   this doesn't upset people as much as it used to.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.120]   The fact I don't use a lot of these apps or have my phone.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.520]   But it really does upset people, right?
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.540]   There's, well, what about this?
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.380]   What about that?
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.200]   What about this?
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.460]   And I don't know how much of this is just maybe
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.860]   I'm oblivious and how much of this
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.980]   is people back sliding explanation
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.340]   for why they do need their phone,
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.660]   why they do need to look at all the time.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:35.140]   But I get a lot of it.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.420]   - Yeah, well, maybe they're upset and you don't know
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.660]   because you're not looking at your phone.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.780]   - That's right.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.500]   Hey, I'll tell you what, that's a blessing.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.300]   Not knowing how upset people are at you.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.260]   Yeah, it's a blessing as a semi-public figure.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.340]   I'll tell you that.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.520]   - Yeah, I can comment on that, but I won't.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.120]   I am on social media and I do enjoy it
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.840]   as we've got started posting on Instagram
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.800]   and then expanded to other platforms, including the podcast.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.760]   But there's a threshold beyond which
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.880]   it becomes counterproductive for sure.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.540]   I think there's information there.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.000]   Like questions that people ask are often informative.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.640]   It's sort of like ending a class
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.920]   and asking, are there any questions?
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.700]   Sometimes the comments that people bring back
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.840]   are truly informative towards both where
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.620]   they might have some misunderstanding,
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:19.920]   but also sometimes some really terrific ideas.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.240]   So there's that, but I completely agree
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.540]   that this is a very precarious space.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.920]   And I'll just relay a quick anecdote.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.260]   Years ago, I gave a quick lecture
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.200]   down at Santa Clara University, South of Stanford.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.240]   And I was talking about this issue.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.600]   I recommended your book and a student came up afterwards
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.040]   and he said, "You don't get it."
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.360]   At that time I was in my early forties.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.000]   He said, "You don't get it.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.560]   You grew up without social media and the phone.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.460]   And so you've adopted it into your life."
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.820]   But we grew up with it.
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.900]   And when my phone, he's speaking for himself
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.440]   and the first person, when my phone loses power,
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.680]   I feel a physical drain within my body.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.340]   And when it comes back on, I feel a lift within my body.
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.920]   So I'd love your thoughts on whether or not
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.580]   you think the phone and perhaps social media as well
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.780]   are in some ways an extension of our brain.
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.880]   It's almost like another cortical area
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.460]   that contains all this information.
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.740]   It's a version of us.
[00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:16.180]   This gets into notions of AI that we can talk about as well.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.940]   I know you're involved in AI and writing about AI.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.660]   But to me, when the phone is used in that way,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.340]   it really is almost like a piece
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.700]   of neural machinery of sorts.
[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.140]   - Yeah, I mean, there's two ways of looking at it.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.860]   Yeah, so there is the sort of cyborg image, I suppose, right?
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:39.260]   Like you're extending, you're plugging into this new sphere.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.380]   Like you have this sort of digital network extension
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.300]   of information and what's going on.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.620]   There's also the much more pessimistic view,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:48.020]   which is no, no, that feeling is the feeling
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.340]   of a moderate behavioral addiction, right?
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.780]   So you'll hear the same thing from a gambler.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:57.020]   I really, when I'm away from being able to play, right,
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.340]   to make my bets or do whatever, like I feel really,
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.680]   I feel not myself.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.900]   And then when I'm around it and I can play
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:04.460]   and make some bets, play some poker, whatever it is--
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.300]   - The feeling of the chips.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.180]   - I feel myself, that chips, right?
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.060]   Like they would say, so it could be,
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.880]   both of these things could be true.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.840]   I think the moderate behavioral addiction side
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.160]   is more true than a lot of us want to admit, actually.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.560]   Like it does feel bad because moderate behavioral addictions
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.120]   build these feedback response loops.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.680]   And then you get the dopamine system going,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.520]   when the anticipation.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.920]   Because what's on there is things that have been engineered
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.280]   that you're gonna get this sort of highly engaging stimuli.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.040]   And then you see the deliverance of that stimuli, right?
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.240]   This really nice piece of glass on a piece of metal,
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.680]   I'm gonna press this sort of carefully,
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.000]   this icon whose colors have been chosen
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.680]   because we know it's gonna hit various parts
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.840]   of our neural alert systems to be as engaging as possible.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.600]   And I'm gonna see something in there
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.160]   that's gonna generate some sort of emotional response.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.480]   So of course, when you see that thing sitting there,
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.320]   you wanna use it.
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.620]   And when you can't, it's a stymie dopamine response.
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.320]   You're like, this is not good, I'm uncomfortable.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.920]   And I think that's a big part of it as well.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.460]   Because I've had this argument with some people,
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:07.600]   and by the way, I see both sides of this.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.680]   Like there are great advantages
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.340]   to what people are doing with these tools.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.840]   It's just that it's all mixed up
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.480]   with all these disadvantages.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.120]   And it becomes very difficult.
[00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.920]   It's like the alcohol in the neighborhood bar
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.480]   is too potent, you know?
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.600]   And people are going there to socialize
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.360]   and they're coming home at three in the morning,
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.160]   you know, passing out, you know?
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.440]   It's like the balance is off.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.400]   Not that there's not something good there,
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.300]   but the balance is off.
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.920]   So it becomes pretty difficult to navigate.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.560]   So I think some of that's what's going on,
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.860]   especially with the younger generation
[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.180]   that was raised on it.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.760]   Which is why, by the way,
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.320]   I think the cultural norms are gonna change around this.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.720]   I think we're gonna think about unrestricted internet usage.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.880]   Not as something that we just sort of bequeath on youth
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.320]   as they become 10 years old,
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.680]   but something that we're actually much more careful about.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.080]   Probably something that's gonna be post-pubescent.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.200]   It's gonna make a lot more sense
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.940]   once you've had more brain development.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.680]   Once you've had more social entrenchment,
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:00.200]   you sort of understand your identity, et cetera.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.840]   Because we recognize, you know,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.960]   the flip side of plugging this thing into your brain is,
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.240]   yeah, you have access to more information,
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.880]   but it also pumps that into your brain.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:09.400]   So I don't know.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.000]   I lean a little bit heavier towards the pessimistic read
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   because I know too many people, because of my books,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.200]   who've really reduced the impact
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.480]   of these things in their lives.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.320]   And they don't, on the far side of that transformation,
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.760]   they don't typically report
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.880]   a great impoverishment experience.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.240]   They don't report, I'm less mentally agile,
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.080]   the information at my fingertips is less,
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.120]   I'm missing out on life.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.880]   There's typically this coming out of the fog
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.080]   on the other side of it, where they're like,
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.560]   oh, this is fine.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.080]   So, you know, I'm a little bit suspicious
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.200]   about exactly what this mechanism is.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.040]   - Yeah, I think you're right
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:44.680]   about the moderate behavioral addiction piece.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.720]   Years ago, when I was starting my lab,
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.320]   I had grants to write,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.640]   and I found the phone to be pretty intrusive
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.820]   for that process.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.640]   So I used to give the phone to somebody in my lab
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.880]   and announce to everyone in my lab
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.240]   that if I asked for it back prior to 5 p.m. that day,
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.440]   I would give everyone in the lab,
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:00.540]   I think it was a $100 bill.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.840]   My lab was pretty big at the time.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.000]   As a junior professor, they did not do,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.960]   not, sorry, academic institutions, not to be named,
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.040]   pay us very much, despite what people might think.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.420]   And it was difficult several times
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.260]   throughout the day or more.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.920]   I was like, ah, I really want to look at that thing.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.840]   But at the end of the day, I'll tell you,
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.660]   no one got paid.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.680]   I got my phone back.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.280]   But it's wonderful, the amount of work
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.480]   that you can get done when that thing is out of the room.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.120]   - I mean, it's my superpower, right?
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.600]   I don't work that hard,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.560]   in the sense that I don't do long hours.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.680]   Like, I'm not constitutionally suited for long hours.
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.600]   This was never my thing.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.480]   My brain tires, right?
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.360]   I mean, I'm good for four,
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.460]   four and a half good hours a day
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.320]   of actually producing good stuff with my brain, probably max.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.660]   But, you know, I don't use my phone that much.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.400]   I don't use the internet that much.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:49.840]   And I prioritize it.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:50.760]   And a lot just gets done.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.040]   It just sort of piles up over time, you know?
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:53.860]   And there's this sense of, like,
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.280]   you must be burning the midnight oil,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.420]   and you have all these things going on.
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.160]   But again, people, I think, underestimate.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.840]   And it's not the underestimate, the impact of this.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.100]   It's not just the accumulation of time
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.240]   you spend looking on your phone.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.820]   It's also this network switching cost, right?
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.320]   Because, like, the phone is very good
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.920]   at inducing a network switch.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.880]   And that's an expensive, time-consuming,
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.880]   energy-consuming neuronal operation.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:18.920]   - Task switching. - Yeah.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.660]   I'm gonna switch my focus of attention from this to that.
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.960]   Like, we can't do that in two seconds, right?
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.800]   That's a hard process.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.620]   It takes a while.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.760]   It's why when you sit down to work on something really hard,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   you have that feeling of, for the first 15 minutes,
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.080]   this is terrible, you know?
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.520]   And then after, like, 15 or 20 minutes,
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.080]   you sort of get into the groove.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.920]   I always assumed part of what's going on
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.440]   is it takes a while for your brain
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.640]   to really start marshaling,
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.940]   okay, so what semantic networks
[00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:44.480]   do we need to start activating here?
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.320]   Oh, we don't need this.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.160]   Let's inhibit this.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.000]   We're not doing that anymore.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.340]   It just takes a while.
[00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.160]   So what happens then when you have a lot of these quick checks
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.420]   to social media, you're jumping in on email back and forth,
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:58.060]   is you have this disaster, catastrophic pile-up
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.960]   of aborted task switches happening, right?
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.840]   And so it's not just the total time you're looking at,
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.680]   let's say, email or social media.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.240]   It's the 15-minute window you have to add
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.520]   around each of those checks
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.800]   in which you have this cognitive disorder.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:12.760]   That really adds up.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:16.140]   And then you realize, oh, there was no time during my day
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.480]   in which I was more than 15 minutes away
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.960]   from looking at something that induced a network switch.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.520]   The data I like to cite,
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.960]   which was looking at email and Slack checks
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.800]   and knowledge workers.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.920]   This came from RescueTime, the software company.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   The median average interval between checks was five minutes.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.220]   It's the median, and the mode was one minute
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.060]   in this data set.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.700]   So it was like, we are checking all the time.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.500]   That means you were never in a state then in your day
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.840]   where you don't have a confused cognitive space,
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.900]   where you don't have,
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.180]   partially you were switching to this task,
[00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:49.340]   but then you switch back to this task before that finished.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.020]   But before you could fully lock in on this task,
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.460]   you look back over here.
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.340]   And so you're spending your entire day
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.060]   in this state of cognitive disorder,
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.560]   which is going to be reduced cognitive output, right?
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.040]   So you get rid of that.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.020]   I mean, I always say like one of my advantages
[00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.680]   is not that I'm doing anything smarter.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   I'm just avoiding sometimes the dumb thing,
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.940]   just holding, slowing other people down.
[00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.840]   You get rid of that,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.480]   and you feel like you're on the world's best neurotropic
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.320]   or something like this.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.120]   Like, oh, I'm just doing this thing.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.960]   I'm doing it pretty well.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:15.780]   Now I'm done.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.660]   This didn't even take that long.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:19.000]   So, I mean, I think people underestimate
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.280]   what's going on here.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.440]   - I'd like to take a quick break
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.040]   to acknowledge our sponsor, Element.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.460]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.580]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:28.900]   That means zero sugar
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.300]   and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes,
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.580]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.360]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.500]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.780]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.860]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.380]   So when you're well hydrated
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.240]   and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.080]   in your system,
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.100]   your mental functioning
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.180]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:52.540]   I drink one packet of Element
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.440]   dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.980]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.940]   as well as while I exercise.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.020]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.900]   I often will drink a third Element packet
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.460]   dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.660]   Element comes in a variety of different flavors,
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.580]   all of which I find really tasty.
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.420]   I like the citrus.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.260]   I like the watermelon.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.320]   I like the raspberry.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.180]   Frankly, I can't pick just one.
[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:17.260]   It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint,
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.500]   which I find tastes best
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.520]   if they are put into water, dissolved, and then heated up.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.980]   I tend to do that in the winter months
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:26.580]   because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.020]   and in the summer and spring months,
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.100]   but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:33.100]   and the environment tends to be dry.
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.260]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.540]   you can go to drinkelement spelled lmnt.com/huberman
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:39.760]   to try a free sample pack.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.260]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.860]   Yeah, we'd like to drill into the concept of context
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.560]   and task switching a bit more.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:53.800]   I do think that the brain has something
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.860]   akin to a transmission system
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.200]   where for people that drive and have driven,
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.960]   the amount of energy that needs to be used
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.720]   in order to accelerate a vehicle
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   to get up to a higher gear,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.080]   it's very different than the equal amount
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.640]   of increase in speed at a given gear, right?
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.200]   So it's sort of the, you hear this
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.740]   if you're not familiar with transmission,
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.080]   so that it sounds like, [imitates engine revving]
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.740]   it sounds as if it's more facile at higher speeds.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.340]   Well, how could it be that you're burning less fuel
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:23.180]   at a higher speed?
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.020]   It's not exactly that way,
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:27.200]   but I think the brain has these sort of transmission systems
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.940]   and what you're describing with people switching back
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.060]   and forth and checking email and phone, et cetera,
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:35.180]   and back to the work that should be at hand
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:37.060]   is sort of akin to going up and down
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:39.260]   the gear system constantly,
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:40.820]   trying to arrive at a given destination.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.740]   And sure, you might arrive,
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.900]   but you're going to burn far more fuel.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.960]   It's the least efficient way to go about it.
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.940]   You want to get into that deep groove.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:51.380]   And I think when we hear about flow,
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.900]   I feel like at least for me,
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.140]   that's the sort of notion of flow that I'm looking for,
[00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.640]   dropping into that deep groove,
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.460]   even if there's some friction within that groove
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.940]   of the challenge of the work that I'm doing,
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.780]   it's about not thinking about anything else.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.900]   It's really about focus, right?
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.940]   And the word flow is just a wonderfully attractive word
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:12.420]   that I think gives us the false impression
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.060]   that we can just drop into things
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.080]   like a square wave function.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.300]   Sit down, pen and paper, go.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:19.260]   And there's no possible way
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.540]   that neural circuits could work that way.
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.980]   - No, let's invent a term.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.740]   And you told me the term makes sense.
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:24.660]   I'm inventing this on the fly,
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:27.580]   but neurosemantic coherence.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.860]   This is going to be my alternative term for flow
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.980]   when you're working on something hard.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.540]   It's not that you're in an actual flow state
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.500]   where you lose track of what you're doing.
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.780]   You're concentrating really hard,
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.940]   but why I'm saying neurosemantic coherence
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.020]   is you get to this place
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.180]   where the sort of relevant semantic neural networks
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:45.360]   are all those that are activated
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.200]   are all relevant to what you're doing.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.680]   And you've over time inhibited
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.600]   most of the unrelated networks that were fired up before.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.620]   And so you get in this sense of it's hard.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:57.280]   Maybe I'm not losing track of time,
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.560]   but like I'm all focused on this.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.480]   I'm grappling with the bear here,
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.800]   the math equation, the book chapter, whatever it is.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   And so it's something different than flow,
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.040]   but it's also different than Linda Stone
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.360]   had the term partial continuous attention,
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.340]   which is what you're that cognitive disaster
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.500]   of I'm constantly network switching back and forth.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.180]   So we'll call it neurosemantic coherence.
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.980]   I got to coin that term
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.700]   because you have this coherence
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.060]   of the semantic neural networks on what you're doing.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.860]   And that's the feeling of
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.140]   I'm getting after this hard problem
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.260]   and it might be really hard to do.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.380]   I mean, I know the feeling of trying to solve a math proof
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.900]   for me, for example, it could be so difficult.
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.140]   'Cause I mean, what does it actually feel like in your head
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.380]   when you're solving a math proof?
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.980]   It's a lot of, you hold this here
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.400]   and then you try to get to the next step by doing this
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.240]   and it doesn't work.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   But you have to keep holding this here,
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.200]   which takes a lot of concentration.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.440]   Okay, let me try this.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.440]   That didn't work either, but this looked promising.
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:52.000]   Okay, so now I need to go back
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.480]   and in my mind's eye, update the setup.
[00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.400]   And now let me try this.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.760]   So it's a lot of holding things in your working memory
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.520]   and keeping them loaded while you try an extension
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.200]   and then evaluating how that worked without.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.000]   And so it requires just internal concentration,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.880]   which isn't pleasant, but in neurosemantic coherence,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.720]   it's all this happening in your world.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.740]   Is that in that proof?
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.860]   So maybe that's what we should be pitching,
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.060]   what people should be looking for is yeah, forget flow,
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.140]   but also remember like this default
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:21.700]   where you're like the rescue time dataset participants
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.580]   checking email once every five minutes.
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:25.340]   That's cognitive nonsense.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.520]   That's crazy.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.240]   That's like, you're trying to play football
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.940]   and you're covering over one of your eyes
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.580]   and wearing like a 50 pound rucksack on.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.940]   You're just like handicapping your abilities here
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.220]   for no reason, right?
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.380]   So what's in between is this idea.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.120]   And that requires focus, requires deep work.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.280]   - Yeah, or playing football.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.000]   And then every three downs or so running into the stands
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.920]   and having a conversation,
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.040]   trying to work out something challenging with your spouse
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.000]   or whatever, then going back
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.360]   and trying a totally different play set, right?
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.240]   At risk of throwing too many analogies and stories,
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.120]   I'll just briefly say,
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:00.440]   I went and saw the play in New York
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.880]   with my sister this year.
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.120]   I think it was "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.440]   or something like that.
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.740]   I didn't really enjoy the play that much,
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:08.200]   but the set stuff was amazing.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.680]   And they have this magic library
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.840]   that I think is very, very relevant here
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.760]   where essentially the book that you open
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   has a certain topic.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.640]   I don't know, maybe it's spells
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:18.480]   or something as Harry Potter.
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.360]   Again, a fun show, but great set stuff
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:24.200]   didn't really resonate with me too much in any event.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.020]   And then the books around it change their topic
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.080]   but are related to that central book.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:30.740]   And then if you look at one particular thing,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.560]   like maybe it's potions or something, I'm making this up.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.440]   And then all of a sudden the books around it change.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.880]   They become either more specific.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.960]   There might be a distant but related idea
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.160]   that could lend itself to creativity.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.520]   So that's the way the brain works in cognition
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.580]   is that we get into a frame of a certain discussion
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.800]   or a certain theme and the books on the shelf change
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.760]   according to their relatedness based on memory of past,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.800]   what's going on now and plans for the future.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.160]   I think anytime we look at, we change context
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.680]   and we look at a raccoon video on Instagram
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.320]   or our calendar and oh, there's that thing,
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.640]   the books become very scattered.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.120]   So when we return to it, there's a lot more friction,
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.720]   a lot more work or neural energy required
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.040]   to get back into that, this narrow states of cognition.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.000]   - Just that exactly explains sort of my experience
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:17.840]   and the way I think about it.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.000]   Yeah, yeah, because it takes time to load up
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.960]   the sort of relevant, the secondary
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.520]   and tertiary semantic ideas.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.360]   And now they're there.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.400]   It's like you can pull from them.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.120]   And then as you shift, you have to sort of shift
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.080]   this whole thing around.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.640]   That takes a lot of concentration.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.760]   I mean, I wrote this article once
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.040]   that got me a little bit of trouble,
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.360]   not trouble, but mild trouble,
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.920]   but it was called "The Chronicle of Higher Education."
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.680]   And the title they gave it was,
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.920]   "Is Email Making Professors Stupid?"
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.240]   Which wasn't my title.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.520]   - You basically called every one of your colleagues stupid.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.600]   - I got it. - 'Cause we all check email.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.280]   - The Dean at the time did call me in for lunch,
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.480]   but actually he was, here's the thing.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.400]   He was like, "Hey, this is real, I agree with this."
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.000]   But what I was arguing actually in that article
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.360]   essentially was, what do we do at a university?
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.080]   'Cause partially what we're supposed to be doing
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.400]   is trying to teach what the life of the mind is
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.840]   and how that works.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.160]   And we've kind of forgotten that.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.960]   So we think we should maybe think about,
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.160]   like at universities, we need to be explicitly
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.880]   not just teaching how to think,
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.720]   but also modeling the life of the mind at the highest level.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.440]   And so this idea that we just allow the professesariat
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   to be drowned in emails and tasks and be as distracted,
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.600]   that's the main war that every research professor has
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.760]   is how do I fight the admin overload
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.720]   until I become famous enough to get an assistant, right?
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.920]   Like this is the big problem.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.160]   And I was making this proposal
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.040]   of universities should be these citadels of concentration.
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.520]   I said, if you wanna get the best academics in the world
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.760]   to your university, just tell them,
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.140]   here's at the top of our contract,
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.000]   you will not be assigned an email address.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.240]   Like you're gonna get Nobel laureates
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.720]   coming from all over the country to come to this place.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.360]   And so I was making this argument,
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.480]   we should think a lot more about thinking.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.520]   We should talk more about it.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.280]   We should model it exactly the type of things
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.920]   you're talking about, but we don't,
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.240]   it's much more contents focused,
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.640]   but really this should be something more
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.600]   that we get into specifically.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.620]   Like this is how you actually use the mind
[01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:12.280]   to produce innovative, interesting,
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.240]   high value, new cognitive artifacts.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.960]   This is a very hard thing we're asking you to do,
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.240]   but you can apprentice here because this is what we do
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.600]   and we've mastered, we're gonna teach you how to do it,
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.280]   but we never have that sort of meta conversation,
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.840]   a sort of metacognition conversation.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.000]   I've always thought that'd be important.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.440]   I think you'd have much better outcomes
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.720]   if that's part of what you learned at the university
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:32.800]   was how to take the thing in your head
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.640]   and really put it to work,
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.440]   really extract out of it as capabilities.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.000]   - Or even high school or even elementary school level.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.200]   - I agree.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.260]   - You have kids, do they have smartphones?
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.100]   - No.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.360]   - How do they feel about that?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.460]   - Well, I mean, they're not old enough yet
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.060]   that it's a real problem,
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:56.840]   but they're not gonna be happy with me probably soon.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.000]   - Hate me now, love me later, as my mother used to say.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.840]   - Basically, because I'm convinced
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.880]   having spent some time thinking about this,
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.880]   writing about this, doing some journalism on this,
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.980]   talking to a lot of the experts
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.320]   that like I think where we're gonna end up
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.600]   where all the arrows from the relevant social psych research
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.560]   which I've been following this research since 2017.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.920]   This is 2017 is roughly
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   when you see the first warning signs going up
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.800]   that we need to worry about
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.600]   the potential mental health impacts of these tools,
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.020]   especially social media and smartphones on young people.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.200]   And you can track this, right?
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.200]   I have a talk I actually gave at my kids' school,
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.400]   they're not happy about this,
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.480]   where I tracked how this research evolved
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.320]   and like any literatures, it's contentious at first
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.560]   and then you begin to see a consilience
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.080]   between different lines of evidence.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.600]   And I think where everything now
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.840]   in the last couple of years is starting to come together,
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.160]   this idea of we don't really know if this is bad or not,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.320]   I think that's just an old take,
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.640]   the research has moved past that.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.120]   And I think where we're landing on
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:59.920]   is unrestricted internet use pre-puberty is risky.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.320]   And like the new standard is gonna be
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.200]   post-puberty is probably the right time
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.640]   to be given a device that gives you unrestricted access.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:09.760]   We're talking like 16 is probably the appropriate age.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.360]   So this does not make me popular at the middle school
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.720]   where my oldest son's about to go.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:16.800]   I think in two or three years
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.760]   that's just gonna be common sense.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:21.120]   This is the direction I see the research literature
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.440]   and the advocacy going.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.600]   And I think there's a solid ground for this.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.880]   - Because you're a computer scientist,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.960]   I can ask this question.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.360]   What about video games?
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.200]   I'm not a big consumer of video games.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.240]   It's been years since I've played one, in fact.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:36.040]   But video games are so very different
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.100]   than smartphones and other technologies
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.480]   because they seem to put,
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.200]   at least the kids I've observed playing them,
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.880]   and adults, into a very narrow trench of attention.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.520]   - Yeah, I mean, there are definitely issues with it.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.320]   I mean, look, I'm not a social psychologist.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.120]   I just sort of play one in my articles,
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.000]   but I've looked into this literature a lot.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.400]   There's a bit of a gendered breakdown
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.680]   that has a lot of overlaps,
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.000]   where when they're looking at potential harms
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.820]   of these technologies, young adolescents, right,
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.620]   pre-adolescent, young adolescents,
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.160]   you tend to see social media to be more a signal
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.120]   for cognitive distress for young women and girls,
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.360]   and the video games to actually be the bigger culprit
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.260]   for young men and boys, right?
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.640]   There is a bit of a difference here
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.120]   because with the social media impact,
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.920]   the content of what's happening matters in this picture,
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.340]   right, so what I'm seeing, the engagement I'm having,
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.640]   how this impacts my social life,
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.920]   this is part of the mental distress.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.180]   With video games, it seems to be more an impact
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.560]   of just disharmonious passion and obsession,
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.000]   just the time it takes, right,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.240]   because the games can be incredibly addictive.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.920]   So the problem that young men are having
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.840]   are just they're playing it all the time,
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.160]   that I'm staying up late
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.100]   because I have an iPad in my room and I'm 14,
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.380]   and I'm gonna play "Fortnite" until three in the morning
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.300]   because my brain cannot handle
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.560]   like what you're giving me here, right?
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.360]   So it's less of a content concern
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.540]   than it is just a time concern, right?
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.780]   That seems more solvable to me, you know,
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.060]   like my solution with my own kids,
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.660]   I don't mind video games, I'm a computer scientist,
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.060]   but I said nothing that's online, right,
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.360]   nothing that was free, 'cause if it was free,
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.380]   that means their business model
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.780]   involves getting you to play it all the time
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:19.420]   so you can upcharge or whatever.
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.580]   They have Nintendo Switches.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.860]   Like I like Nintendo, okay, Nintendo Switch,
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.460]   here's a $60 Zelda game
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.840]   that someone spent five years making or whatever.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.740]   You can only play those games so long at a time
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.300]   before, you know, you're tired, you come back to it.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.780]   They don't have an addictive response to it.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.220]   If they get an iPad with a game on it,
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.940]   they'll just like play that 'til their eyes bleed
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.380]   because those are meant to be addictive.
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.980]   So I'm wary about video games,
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.660]   but there it's all just a usage game.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.660]   So you stick away from the more addictive games.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.140]   It's a much easier problem to solve, I think,
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:50.340]   than the social media issue.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.080]   - Earlier, you talked about books.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.300]   I still read hardcover and paperback books.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:59.100]   What are your thoughts on audio books
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.740]   and learning by way of audio book
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.540]   versus paper in front of you,
[01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:06.820]   flipping a physical device or Kindles?
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.840]   I don't know if there's any real research on this.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.700]   I've seen a little bit,
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.180]   but I'm curious what you've encountered
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.420]   and what your thoughts are as well.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   You could speculate.
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.020]   - Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you personally,
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.540]   I can only do fiction and audio books, right?
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.940]   'Cause when I'm in a nonfiction experience,
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.500]   I'm just very used to constantly looking
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.340]   for connections and ideas.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:26.900]   And so I have to be able to slow down and then speed up
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.180]   and then go back to something I just read.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:31.320]   So I really have a distressing experience
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.580]   trying to listen to nonfiction audio books.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.900]   Fiction's fine.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:35.740]   That's great.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.440]   Let me put a thriller on an Audible.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.980]   Great, I'll listen to it.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.620]   And I think some of this might be particular
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.700]   to my engagement with books,
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.500]   which is I'm a writer and a thinker,
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.940]   so I'm constantly looking for ideas.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:48.460]   And so I might have a different engagement
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.260]   with a nonfiction book than someone
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.900]   just listening to one of my books,
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.940]   but I can only do fiction on audio.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:54.780]   - That makes sense.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:58.060]   Thinking about what works for me, what doesn't, I agree.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.800]   I love stories and fiction by audio book,
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:06.780]   ideally consumed on a long drive or a hike,
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.380]   but nonfiction requires that I take notes
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:14.380]   and see things in their kind of respective spatial layout.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:15.220]   And yeah.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.700]   In your most recent book,
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:22.260]   you describe this concept of pseudo productivity.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.420]   Is pseudo productivity a general term
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.540]   to refer to some of the things we've already talked about,
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.140]   this task switching, context switching,
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.660]   or is pseudo productivity something
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.180]   that includes other categories
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.340]   of limiting ourselves as well?
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:38.300]   - I mean, I think it's more specific than that, right?
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:42.140]   So to me, pseudo productivity was the answer
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.020]   that we came up with in knowledge work to a real dilemma,
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:48.380]   which is that's a sector using your brain
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.300]   primarily to create value.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.780]   That's a sector that emerged as a major part of the economy
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:54.860]   in roughly the mid 20th century.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.020]   When that emerged, all the definitions of productivity
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:02.100]   that we had were inspired from agriculture and industry.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.140]   So in agriculture, we can have ratios,
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.140]   bushels of corn per whatever acres of land under cultivation
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.940]   and industrial manufacturing, we have ratios,
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:14.180]   modalities per input labor hour.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.100]   So you could just measure these things.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.220]   We also had clearly defined systems of production.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.060]   So you could then say,
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.180]   if I change this about the system of production,
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.580]   what happens to this number?
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.020]   And you could do gradient descent, right?
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.980]   Okay, I do this, that number goes down.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.820]   Let's not do that.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.740]   If I make this change, it goes up.
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.900]   That's a better way of building it.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.500]   Like this was the dominant way
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.380]   of thinking about productivity since basically Adam Smith.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.780]   The knowledge work arises.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:36.460]   That doesn't work, right?
[01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:38.420]   Because I'm working on whatever, five different things.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.540]   It's different than what you were working on.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.380]   How I'm managing my work is entirely obfuscated, right?
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.980]   In knowledge work, organizational ideas
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.660]   is entirely left up to the individual,
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.700]   how you manage your work
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.100]   and your workload and collaboration.
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:50.940]   That's like up to you.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.340]   That's all obfuscated.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.940]   So there's no number to measure.
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.340]   There's no system to improve.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.580]   So I think it was a real quandary.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.620]   My argument is what essentially
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.020]   the management class came up with is pseudo productivity,
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.420]   which is, okay, in the absence of being able
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.100]   to be quantitative about this,
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:09.460]   we will use visible activity as a proxy for useful effort.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.300]   So that's it.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.860]   Like we see you doing things that's better than not.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.740]   The more we see you doing the better.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.180]   I call that pseudo productivity.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:18.540]   And I think that's implicitly how we've been organizing
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.100]   the management of knowledge, work, labor since the 1950s.
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.020]   - And when you say visibility at people doing things,
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.820]   this is the conflating of busyness with actual productivity.
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.100]   - Yes, and so the problem came
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.460]   when we had this general way of measuring,
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.340]   approximating productive effort,
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.860]   which wasn't very good, but whatever, right?
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.660]   I mean, I want to see you're at the office
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:40.740]   and you're doing things.
[01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.900]   The problem was the front office IT revolution, right?
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.660]   Because I'm essentially a technocritic.
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.820]   I see everything through the lens of technology
[01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:49.180]   in my writing.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.940]   We got computers, we got networks, we got email.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:55.180]   Pseudo productivity can't be sustainable in that context
[01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.620]   because now with something like email
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.420]   and then later tools like Slack,
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.300]   I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain, right?
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.980]   Because I can send an email, respond to this,
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:06.180]   jump onto a Slack conversation.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.900]   I can now do that at a very fine grain level
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.180]   and essentially everywhere and anywhere.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.420]   All throughout my day, I can be demonstrating labor.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.780]   At home, I can be demonstrating labor
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.300]   because we have mobile computing,
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.620]   we get the smartphone revolution.
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.380]   So there's now an ability to constantly be
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.460]   demonstrating effort at all points of our day.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.060]   And that's where I think the wheels came off the bus, right?
[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.620]   And led to this point that got worse and worse
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.860]   starting in the early 2000s
[01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.940]   and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout,
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.740]   knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.100]   of like, what's going on with my job?
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.260]   Like, all I do is Zoom all day, what's happening?
[01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.500]   I think that pseudo productivity
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.340]   plus front office IT revolution,
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.940]   they did not play nice together.
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.900]   And you can see this by the way,
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.860]   if you look even at productivity books,
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.340]   you see this huge shift that happens
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.340]   early '90s versus early 2000s.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.540]   It's like a completely shift in tone, right?
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.420]   Early '90s, it's Stephen Covey is very optimistic.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.180]   It's like, how are we gonna self-actualize
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.220]   and like carefully choose the most meaningful activities
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:07.580]   to fulfill all of our dreams for all of our roles.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.980]   Early 2000s, now we have email, you have David Allen.
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.340]   There's like, oh my God, we're so overwhelmed with tasks.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:15.260]   All we can hope for is like these little moments
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.700]   of Zen in the day.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.740]   If we can just automate
[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.580]   how we're just churning through these widgets,
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.940]   at least we can find some cognitive piece.
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.180]   What happened in those 10 years
[01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:24.940]   was the front office IT revolution.
[01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.180]   And now we just felt like we had to constantly
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.980]   be demonstrating that visual effort.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.860]   So, I think that's where we got into the problem,
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:33.660]   pseudo productivity plus technology.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:37.540]   - Recently, my podcast team was in Australia
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:42.540]   and my producer and close friend here, Rob Moore,
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.380]   instructed all of us to get rid of social media
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.940]   on our phones, except one guy
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.120]   who would post our weekly episodes announcements.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:53.620]   And it was pretty brutal at first.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.420]   And then coming back to social media
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.540]   has actually turned out to be more challenging.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.740]   You really experienced the friction
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.420]   coming back the other way.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.260]   And then one experiences the lack of friction
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.300]   and that's where it gets scary.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.940]   It's so interesting the way that the brain can adapt
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.020]   the friction, leaving something behind,
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.580]   the friction coming back to it.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.540]   And I think for people listening to this,
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.900]   I raise this because I think,
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.060]   of course, many people listening are,
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.580]   have work that they really need to focus on.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.020]   They may be having issues with productivity
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:28.420]   and burnout, et cetera.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.780]   I think a lot of people use the phone and social media
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.900]   because it fills their life.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.380]   It provides some enrichment
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.140]   and they aren't necessarily committed to specific projects.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.460]   But I guess through the lens of the,
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.680]   let's just call it the Cal Newportian lens,
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.180]   one might argue that those people
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:46.360]   almost certainly have untapped creativity,
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.820]   untapped resources within them
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.720]   that they don't yet know about
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.380]   because they're essentially using that energy elsewhere.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:57.220]   - Yeah, I mean, I think for a lot of people,
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:59.180]   it's papering over the void, right?
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.180]   You have this void in your life
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:06.180]   because there's unmet potential, unmet interest,
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.820]   living in misalignment with the things you care about,
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.660]   right?
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:10.480]   I mean, a lot of people,
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.220]   this is the classic sort of catastrophe of life, right?
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.140]   Social media, and there's,
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.700]   before this, it was other things, right?
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:17.700]   There was other intoxicants
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.760]   or other sorts of distractions.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.780]   It's a way for some people
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:24.580]   of essentially putting a screen over that like gaping void.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:27.260]   And it like just makes it bearable enough
[01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.460]   that you can kind of go on with life.
[01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.300]   And so it is true, if you just rip it out,
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.740]   you see the void.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.980]   And that's really difficult, right?
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.180]   I mean, 'cause I did this experiment for one of my books.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:40.060]   I ran an experiment with 1600 people
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:43.300]   and they all turned off all their social media for 30 days.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.660]   - 30 days? - 30 days, right?
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:46.060]   - These are young people, old people?
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.780]   - A whole mix, a whole mix, right?
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.940]   - Not just university students.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:51.500]   - I recruited them from my newsletter readership.
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.660]   So they weren't university students.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.720]   And it wasn't formal research.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.620]   It was, you know, I put out the call, right?
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.140]   So this is not randomly sampled, right?
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.100]   But I put out the call and I said,
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.100]   "Here, I'm gonna walk you through this."
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.620]   And then I got a lot of information back.
[01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:03.820]   So people reported back how it went.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:06.360]   And this was like the number one thing I heard
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.620]   was it's really hard at first, right?
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.400]   And so who were the people that succeeded for 30 days
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.580]   versus those who didn't?
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.340]   The ones who didn't succeed
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.460]   tended to just try to white knuckle it.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.940]   Just be like, "I don't like how much I'm using social media.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:20.560]   "I'm just gonna stop because it's bad
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.520]   "and I don't wanna do a bad thing.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:22.620]   "I'm just gonna like, you know,
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.260]   "hold on the table with white knuckles."
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.820]   They wouldn't make it 30 days.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:28.580]   The people who did succeed followed my advice
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:32.100]   to incredibly aggressively pursue alternatives
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.020]   in those 30 days.
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.660]   So it's like, go learn new hobbies,
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.660]   join things right away,
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.160]   get like really structured about your day,
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.540]   get into exercise again, learn how to knit again.
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.780]   A lot of people said, "Oh, I learned about,
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.820]   "I forgot how fun libraries were."
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:46.020]   Like, you can go into this building
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:47.220]   and like all the books are free
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.900]   and you could just grab whatever
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.220]   and it's okay if you don't like the book
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.020]   because you didn't have to pay for it.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   I'm going out with friends again.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.180]   Okay, every week I'm gonna have, you know,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.780]   we're gonna have drinks with this person
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.060]   and every Thursday morning,
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.700]   I'm gonna go running with this person.
[01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.180]   The people who aggressively tried to put in place
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.500]   a more positive alternative
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.780]   through self-reflection experimentation,
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.360]   they lasted to 30 days and beyond, right?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.660]   And so then I came to realize like,
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.900]   "Oh, I see what's happening here
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.180]   "is you have these unmet needs."
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:17.180]   These tools can give you sort of a simulacrum
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:18.020]   of meeting them.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.220]   I need, I'm a social being,
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.420]   I need to be connected to people.
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.980]   Well, I'm texting and like doing comments on social media.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.100]   It sort of touches that a little bit,
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.000]   just enough that you don't feel hopelessly lonely,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.820]   but it's not really fulfilling that.
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.900]   I have a need to like see my intentions
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:33.420]   made manifest concretely in the world.
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.560]   Humans wanna do this.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.580]   Well, I'm, you know,
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.700]   posting these things and people are responding.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.540]   It's sort of this simulacrum of real creation.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.300]   So it's like kind of satisfying that just enough
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.020]   that it's not just intolerable, right?
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:48.300]   And so what happens is if you remove that,
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:50.500]   you have to actually fill those things the right way.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.100]   So now I'm not socializing on social media,
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.540]   but I'm going out of my way to sacrifice time and attention
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.940]   on behalf of other people.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:59.240]   I'm feeling the social void in the right way.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.260]   Now I don't really feel like I need to go back.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:04.620]   I'm actually build, making my intentions manifest.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.140]   I'm learning skills and building things.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.580]   Now the sort of pseudo construction
[01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.740]   and the collective attention economy of social media,
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:13.680]   I'll post this and you'll like it, I'll like this.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.580]   I don't need that anymore to fill that void.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.540]   So it's like, you have to fill the void first.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.880]   So, you know, five years ago,
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.780]   I wrote a book that was about
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:23.660]   reforming this part of your life.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.460]   And a lot of the book had nothing to do with technology,
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.340]   but about how to actually just rebuild parts of your life.
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.740]   And on my podcast,
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.660]   honestly like one of the big topics we talk about,
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.440]   which is crazy that I'm a technologist
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.780]   and I write about trying to find focus
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.980]   in a distracted world,
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.980]   is this thing we call the deep life,
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.940]   which is just straight up building a meaningful life 101.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:47.500]   And it's like crazy that my podcast is talking about it.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.540]   But on the other hand, it's not
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.160]   because mine's the podcast people go to
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.560]   and they're fed up with the digital world.
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.820]   And it turns out if you don't get the analog world
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:56.420]   working right for you,
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.820]   you need something to avoid staring into that void.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.820]   And the digital world will do that well enough.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.320]   It's like just good enough to keep life tolerable.
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:07.260]   - There's a lot of discussion nowadays about ADHD,
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.220]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
[01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:12.560]   sometimes minus the H, minus the hyperactivity.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:18.000]   A lot of kids have true clinically diagnosed ADHD.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.620]   So we want to be sensitive to that.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:22.100]   It's a real issue for a lot of people.
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:24.900]   A lot of adults have true ADHD,
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.460]   but nowadays people talk about ADHD the same way
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.340]   terms like depression, trauma, gaslighting,
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.660]   and et cetera are discussed in non-clinical territory.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:38.060]   - OCD, people use non-clinically as well.
[01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:38.900]   - Right, right.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:40.800]   And I'm not disparaging that,
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.700]   it's just that we have sort of a dilution
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.780]   of deeper understanding
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.880]   of what these things really are and aren't.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:48.440]   What are your thoughts?
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.680]   I realize you're not a psychiatrist,
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.680]   but what are your thoughts on the idea
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.760]   that many people that think
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.160]   they perhaps have true attention issues
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.840]   have either built those attention issues
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.960]   through neuroplasticity into their system,
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.240]   meaning their system probably worked,
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.120]   nervous system probably worked pretty well to focus,
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.880]   but they engaged in enough task switching
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.360]   that the circuits of the brain involved in cognition
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.280]   became optimized for this very distributed cognition
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.220]   as opposed to narrow focused attention.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.180]   And what are your thoughts
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:27.020]   about the amount of stimulant use on college campuses
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.300]   and in adult populations to try and overcome this?
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.740]   I feel like there's a lot of attempts to use pharmacology
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.780]   to match the level of distraction,
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:39.100]   to try and make the distraction not seem like distraction,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:42.820]   but this is an area I hear a lot about
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.800]   given the nature of the things I cover on the podcast.
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.680]   I think a lot of these issues are phone induced, right?
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.240]   And I think the problem is not solvable as much.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.080]   You don't need pills,
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:53.840]   you need a different phone relationship.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.240]   My optimistic hypothesis is again,
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:02.240]   this non-clinical difficulty with maintaining attention,
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.560]   like in your work or if you're a college student or whatever
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.040]   is not necessarily representing sort of knock on wood,
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.620]   like a wholesale neural rewiring.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.560]   Like I basically rewired my circuits on my brain
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:15.040]   to be a sort of distributed switching processor.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.760]   I think most of this is persisting
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.160]   in that much more malleable area
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.640]   that gets affected by moderate behavioral addictions, right?
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.840]   So we have parts of the brain
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.760]   that are part of these like feedback reward loops
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.500]   that's meant to be malleable, right?
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:29.900]   I mean, this is supposed to be
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.160]   so we can have really rapid learning
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.760]   about what's happening in our environment
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.120]   and how we're supposed to respond to it.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:37.000]   And then this is what gets hijacked
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.960]   when you build up these behavioral addictions.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.320]   And so it's very quick to change,
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.120]   but that malleability means you can change it back, right?
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:47.360]   So I think this drive to I have to keep checking my email
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360]   or my phone is again,
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.040]   you build up a moderate behavioral addiction
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.560]   because of like standard reward cues.
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.520]   And that's a part of the brain that you can't,
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.080]   it's difficult, but it's not your whole brain
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.520]   is now a social media brain.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.720]   And that's just the brain you have
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.240]   because you're exposed to this.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.080]   It's a matter of getting the stimuli out of your life,
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.160]   doing the same type of training you would do,
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.880]   boredom exposure, like get used to the idea
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.420]   of feeling that drive and not actually doing it.
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.720]   You can work with blocking apps,
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.560]   like there's stuff you can do.
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.760]   This is sort of like standard, it's painful,
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.280]   it takes two months and then like you're doing better on it.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.080]   So I do think we have a large stratum
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.920]   of subclinical attention issues
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.400]   that are not representing wholesale neural rewirings,
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.080]   but are like absolutely sort of expected outcomes
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:37.520]   of working with malleable reward cue circuits in the brain.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.640]   We can fix those just like we can,
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.960]   if you're gambling too much
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.300]   or compulsively eating the junk food or something.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.440]   We don't say your whole brain got rewired for junk food.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.720]   It's like, no, you have this particular cue cycle
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:51.560]   that we have to work on.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.120]   So maybe I'm being optimistic there.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.200]   I mean, you know the brain better,
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.240]   but like it would be extraordinary
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.840]   if in like a 10 year period, right,
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:03.000]   your entire brain somehow got rewired in a way
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.600]   that it couldn't sustain focus anymore.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.640]   - I totally agree with that statement,
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.000]   unless you're a young person
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.900]   and you grew up in a distracted world
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.640]   and your brain optimized as the young brain does
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.120]   for the conditions it's in.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.120]   And then I think you have a real issue,
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.040]   which is not to say it can't be rescued
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:24.760]   through the use of discipline, tools, protocols,
[01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.160]   pharmacology, nutrition, great sleep,
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.040]   and if necessary, prescription drugs, right?
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.760]   Because there is a case for prescription drugs
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:34.160]   in certain instances for ADHD.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.720]   And as I understand it, anytime people say,
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.740]   wait, aren't those drugs just meth?
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:40.580]   Isn't it just speed?
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.520]   Yep, they are amphetamines in most cases.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.160]   And the idea is to increase the deployment
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:48.320]   of certain neuromodulators, the ones I mentioned before,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.800]   as a means to induce neuroplasticity
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.640]   so that the focus state becomes more of a default state.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   So I think that young people are in trouble.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.160]   I think that we- - I do worry about young people.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.320]   - I think it's akin to putting them
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.460]   in a kind of a, well, we know this in the visual system.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.000]   If you take an animal or human
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.120]   and you put them into an altered visual environment,
[01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.200]   the visual system changes
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.320]   and your perception of the visual world becomes inaccurate.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.680]   And the way I think of this cognitively
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.960]   with respect to attention, the analogy would be,
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.800]   I think we've been, for the last 10 years or so,
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.040]   10, 15 years, we've been raising kids
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.840]   in a sort of house of funhouse mirror things,
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.760]   which is anything but fun, where you look at yourself
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.960]   and your legs are shorter than your torso is long.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.120]   And so everywhere you turn,
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.920]   you're getting a distorted perception
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.840]   and trying to navigate the world
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:42.640]   through that distorted perception is very, very difficult.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.360]   You can do it, but it's a lot of extra work.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.400]   That's what I feel we've done to young people.
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.120]   - I'm very concerned about that as well.
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:49.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.600]   And I think, I don't know what your take on this,
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:55.280]   but like, do you think at the undergraduate level
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.080]   that we have just been, not explicitly,
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.700]   but just sort of implicitly, professors in general,
[01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:05.360]   we have been just sort of slowly adapting
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:08.360]   the difficulty of what we're teaching, et cetera,
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.720]   because maybe there's a reduced cognitive focus capacity,
[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.080]   which is like the key skill
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:15.560]   for this sort of very artificial thing of learning,
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.240]   complicated college level work.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.600]   I think this would be an interesting experiment to find out
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.000]   is have we been implicitly having to sort of simplify things
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.380]   to keep, roughly speaking, grade distributions
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:27.520]   where normatively we feel comfortable?
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.980]   I mean, do we see the signal yet?
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:29.820]   That's my interest.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.800]   Do we see the signal yet?
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.320]   If we look back a generation 20 years ago versus now.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.160]   - I don't know.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.940]   For courses of the sort that I teach
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.180]   or taught until very recently, I still teach,
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.800]   but I was directing the neuroanatomy course
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.480]   and there's a laboratory module.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.040]   So the students dissect brains,
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.840]   they're holding actual human brains.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:50.180]   That's a real physical contact
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.200]   that cannot be recapitulated digitally.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.560]   You just can't do it.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.080]   You can try, use VR, but it ain't the same.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.080]   I mean, how would you like it
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.920]   if you're a neurosurgeon learned on a virtual brain
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.680]   and then does surgery on a real brain?
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.540]   No, no such thing should happen.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.320]   I think that my experience with this
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:15.320]   is perhaps most relevant with respect to social media
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.200]   where I teach neuroscience.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.040]   And I use a variety of duration of clips,
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.080]   the 90 second reel, the seven minute thing,
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.640]   the two and a half hour podcast.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.560]   We have podcast, solo podcast at a four and a half hours.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.520]   I don't know how many people listen start to finish,
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:35.040]   but I think having a variety of different durations
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:35.880]   really helps.
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.280]   And I'm told by my team, I have a TikTok account,
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.720]   although I've never logged on there.
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.560]   You know, I think TikTok represents the extreme
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.560]   of kind of bubble gum level information/entertainment.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.500]   And they really nailed some circuit
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:57.480]   that can handle information of about 30 to 60 seconds
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   in a format that tickles the brain just right
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:03.780]   to keep swiping, liking, commenting, and sharing.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.920]   And I don't think that's anything
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.280]   like a real understanding or education.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.640]   Yeah, I mean, it's nothing like a real understanding
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.480]   or education.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.760]   - Yeah, I mean, TikTok in particular,
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.120]   like I think something what people get wrong about TikTok
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.920]   is they think that there was a real algorithmic innovation,
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.080]   which is actually not the case.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.240]   Like as far as I understand the machine learning algorithm
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.600]   underneath TikTok is probably like a relatively standard
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.960]   sort of multi-arm bandit, you know,
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.080]   intermittent feedback reinforcements algorithm.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.260]   All they did is they cleared out all the other noise.
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.740]   So, you know, if you're Facebook or something like this,
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.840]   you're trying to use algorithms to curate things,
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.380]   but you have all of these other legacy structures
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.440]   you also have to try to satisfy.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.720]   There's friends and, you know, you wanna show stuff
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720]   that your friends like more than other people,
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.160]   and there's groups you're joining.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.280]   TikTok just got rid of all the noise.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.200]   And so we're just gonna, all we're doing is optimizing
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.400]   watch time to, we think, we don't know,
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.840]   but we think watch time is the main thing
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.640]   that they're optimizing.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.480]   So we'll optimize it, watch time.
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.800]   And everything, all these videos all just exist
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.320]   as multi-dimensional points in this sort of semantic cloud.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.640]   And all we're doing is just showing you things.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.440]   And then you swipe another thing, swipe another thing.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.600]   So when you get rid of all the noise
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.640]   from a machine learning algorithm,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.320]   it doesn't also have to satisfy
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.280]   that I follow this person on Instagram,
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.440]   or this is my friend.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:21.720]   All I have to do is optimize this one number.
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.440]   How long did they watch before they swiped?
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.540]   It just turns out like, oh, it's really easy.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.940]   Like you do that for a couple hours,
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.080]   you're gonna hone in on these sub regions
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.640]   in this massive multi-dimensional space
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.080]   of stuff that just tickles this particular person's brain.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.340]   You know, and it's very cybernetic
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.760]   because now I'm the user of TikTok,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.080]   I'm the content creator.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.400]   I'm getting immediate feedback, what's working, what's not.
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.020]   I really quickly find these particularly rich regions
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.800]   in this sort of cybernetic space.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.280]   And so it's like TikTok just purified something
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.880]   that was simple, basic machine learning,
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.960]   but just like purify what we're doing here.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.560]   And that turned out to be enough to create
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.820]   what's like probably the most addictive force
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.140]   we've seen in the digital world in a long time.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.900]   - So TikTok is optimized for dwell time.
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.540]   - Yeah, that's the thought, right?
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:03.520]   Because it's not public.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.940]   So like we don't exactly know how the algorithm works,
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.460]   but people have been studying it like a Skinner box,
[01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.860]   you know, a hundred phones.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.280]   And we look at all these accounts, look at the variables.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.540]   It seems like that's largely what it's optimizing for
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:20.300]   is how long did you watch before you swiped, right?
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:21.140]   And that's it.
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.660]   I mean, it's not, this was both what was smart about TikTok
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:27.180]   and also why I've been arguing it's destabilized
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:29.780]   the whole traditional social media narrative
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.740]   is because the traditional massive social media players
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:36.100]   of the last decade had this first mover advantage
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.460]   on these giant actual social networks, right?
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:41.940]   So like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:46.860]   had these massive networks of people's preferences
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.780]   of I'm following this person and this person I'm following
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:53.420]   and they could leverage these actual social graphs
[01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.660]   as a huge source of producing interesting content, right?
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.260]   And this was a huge first mover advantage
[01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:01.240]   because you can't, it's hard to get a hundred million people
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.780]   to use something now, right?
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.900]   TikTok got rid of all of that.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.980]   We don't want a social graph.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.980]   You as a user don't have to declare anything.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.480]   You don't have to follow people
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.880]   or say who your friends are.
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:11.420]   We'll just start showing you things.
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.300]   And that was more compelling
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:15.100]   than what you could generate with a social graph.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:17.760]   But now there's no first mover advantage.
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:21.260]   So as the big social media players follow the TikTok model
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.420]   which is much more algorithmic,
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.440]   let's just try to curate based on algorithms,
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.460]   not who you follow or who your friends are,
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:28.300]   they're now much more vulnerable
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.860]   because TikTok could come along and do this
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:31.220]   without having to spend five years
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.500]   getting people to declare their friends.
[01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.260]   And now if someone else could come along and do this.
[01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.660]   So I think the major players are giving away
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.060]   their competitive advantage,
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:39.980]   which is this social graph IP
[01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:41.860]   that no one will ever replicate again.
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:43.340]   They're giving away that advantage.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.900]   And now it's a free for all playing field
[01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:46.620]   of all sources of attention and engagement.
[01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:50.880]   So I don't know, I think TikTok accidentally destabilized
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.200]   the social media decade that had been defining
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.180]   until I think just recently.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.560]   - What I find so interesting about social media platforms
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.040]   like TikTok is that sure,
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.320]   it makes sense that kids and teens would use it.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.000]   They were raised with it, Snapchat, et cetera.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.560]   But when I see my peers who, you know,
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.600]   we call ourselves adults,
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.360]   people in their mid to late forties, fifties,
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:17.980]   essentially like playing kids' games
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.580]   or engaging through these platforms that are,
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.580]   and they're not childlike necessarily,
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.520]   but they just prove that the,
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.740]   or rather that their adherence/addiction to them
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.180]   just proves that this is tapping
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:33.500]   into some core neural circuit that exists in everyone.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.460]   So while it might be shaping the young brain a lot,
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.500]   this is adults basically eating junk food all day,
[01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:41.140]   which raises a question, you know,
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.060]   I think while there are many different ways to eat
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.780]   and that's not a topic we want to get into now,
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:49.100]   Lord knows that's a great way to create
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:50.680]   a lot of social media content,
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:51.800]   debating which diet,
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:54.300]   omnivore, carnivore, vegan, et cetera.
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.040]   The notion of intermittent fasting,
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.040]   limiting one's portion of the day where they eat
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.360]   to whatever, six hours, four hours, 12 hours,
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.040]   is an interesting one
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.080]   that maybe has some applicability here.
[01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.120]   What are your thoughts about
[01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:12.700]   simply not turning on the phone,
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.360]   maybe even not turning wifi on
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.400]   if people are not as disciplined as you are
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.520]   with the laptop or tablet
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.800]   for the first two hours of the day
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:21.960]   or four hours of the day,
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:23.560]   or for a portion of the day,
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:27.440]   sort of like you're taking a social media fast
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:28.760]   that isn't 30 days.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.400]   It's, you know, which I think for a lot of people
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.680]   is going to evoke high cortisol release,
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.840]   just the idea of it.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.760]   - Yeah, you know, this is an idea I've written about before.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.600]   You know, in "Deep Work,"
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.020]   I had this chapter called "Embrace Boredom."
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.720]   That was the entire idea, right?
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.420]   So the idea was boredom by itself
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:47.880]   is not, I think, laudable, right?
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.560]   There's a reason why it feels distressing.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.480]   When things feel distressing,
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.920]   that's usually an evolutionary signal
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:53.640]   that there's something going on here.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:55.120]   But what I was arguing in that chapter
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.880]   was exactly what you're talking about.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.680]   You should have some moments every day
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.600]   where you're free from distraction
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.720]   even though you could be accessing distraction
[01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:05.840]   and you want to.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.800]   And like a little bit each day, 20 minutes each day,
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.680]   and then maybe a longer session once a week,
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:11.260]   like a couple hours.
[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:12.780]   My argument for that was
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:15.500]   it's about breaking a Pavlovian connection in this sense,
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.340]   right?
[01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:18.380]   So if it's every time I feel bored,
[01:32:18.380 --> 01:32:19.860]   I'm lacking novel stimuli,
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:22.180]   I get this release of the phone.
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.100]   Your mind is really gonna make that association
[01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.020]   of like, this is what we always do.
[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.520]   If sometimes you don't,
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.020]   it's a different cognitive landscape, right?
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:32.620]   Your mind is, sometimes we get the distraction,
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.120]   sometimes we don't.
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.500]   That's a much better place to be
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.600]   because now when it comes time
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.940]   to actually focus on something,
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:39.840]   your mind's like, I've been here before,
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.160]   like we don't always get the distraction.
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.240]   So this is going back early 20th century psychology,
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:46.720]   there's probably a more neuroscientific way
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:47.560]   to think about this,
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.120]   but it's like breaking Pavlovian loops.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:52.320]   If like sometimes at the end of the day I'm exhausted,
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.400]   it's Instagram time and it like scratches an itch.
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.160]   But other times I'm bored,
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.960]   I'm in line at the pharmacy and I don't look at the phone.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.340]   My brain learns like, yeah, we don't always do it.
[01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:02.440]   And so the idea is that
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.840]   if you make boredom more tolerable,
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.720]   then you're much more likely to succeed
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.300]   with doing things that are boring, but hard.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:09.500]   And I think deep work, for example,
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.540]   is boring just in the clinical sense
[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.260]   of there's lack of novel stimuli.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.460]   You're just doing the same thing for a long time.
[01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:16.940]   So I've always advocated for that,
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:20.540]   is like, you shouldn't be super uncomfortable with boredom.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:22.580]   Like don't go seeking it, I'm not a big believer of,
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:26.140]   and boredom is where all creative insight comes from.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.580]   I think it's a strong evolutionary cue,
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.640]   like leave this state,
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.740]   but you do have to have some tolerance for it.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.340]   - I wonder if we need a different word than boredom.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.660]   Are you familiar with this notion
[01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:39.100]   of gap effects in learning?
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.980]   These gap effects are similar to the effects
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.240]   of neural processing during sleep.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.860]   Focused attention with some agitation
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.760]   triggers neuroplasticity in learning,
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:50.880]   but it's during sleep in particular, deep sleep,
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.860]   rapid eye movement, sleep, states of depressed,
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.140]   maybe in some forms of meditation,
[01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:56.620]   that the actual rewiring takes place.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.360]   And then there's this literature about gap effects,
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.080]   which have been demonstrated for music, for math,
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:02.520]   for many things in which if people say
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.340]   are practicing new scales on the piano, for instance,
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.460]   but it could be any scale.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:11.220]   And then they intermittently are cued by a buzzer
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.540]   to just stop and do nothing.
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:15.100]   The hippocampus, which is involved in learning memory,
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.260]   replays the action, sometimes in reverse,
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:18.860]   just as it occurs during sleep,
[01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.080]   at a rate of maybe 20 or 30 times faster at the neural level.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.340]   We're not talking about boredom.
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:28.260]   What we're talking about is pauses during which perhaps
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:32.660]   we are obtaining accelerated neuroplasticity.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:35.420]   The gap effects certainly accelerate learning.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.060]   I've talked about these in other podcasts,
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.060]   but I wonder whether or not this thing
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:38.900]   that you're calling boredom.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.480]   So being in line to get some groceries
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:43.040]   and not taking one's phone out
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.460]   while the checker is scanning the groceries through
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.380]   and just not really doing much of anything,
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:49.460]   it's entirely possible that the thing
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.900]   that we were working on earlier that day
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.420]   or the previous day is being processed in the hippocampus
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.820]   at an unconscious level at a much more rapid rate
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.180]   where we to look at our phone,
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:00.060]   we would inhibit those gap effects,
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:01.660]   which are truly beneficial.
[01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.020]   - Yeah, well, I mean, professors feel this all the time,
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.660]   right, at least a lot of ones I've talked to
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.500]   with peer review.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.700]   So I don't know if you've had this experience,
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.400]   but you're like reviewing a paper.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.860]   I often have this experience
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:13.340]   where when I'm first engaging with the paper,
[01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.820]   I feel incredibly frustrated.
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:17.120]   Like I don't quite understand what they're doing here.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.540]   Like this mathematics isn't quite making sense to me.
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.300]   And it'll often be the fact I come back later.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.820]   Like, well, let me just like write up what I have so far.
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:27.580]   And your understanding is like much, much better, right?
[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:28.580]   So there's this sense
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:30.060]   of maybe something's been processing.
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:32.180]   I took that so seriously when I was a,
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:34.260]   especially at postdoc, like when I was at the height
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.580]   of just all I do in my life is produce value with my brain.
[01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.980]   Every day I would do what I call Thoreau walks
[01:35:39.980 --> 01:35:42.900]   because I discovered Thoreau while a grad student,
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:44.020]   I read it down by the Charles,
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:45.580]   like the full sort of, you know,
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.860]   just minus the beret, like pretentious grad student thing.
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:50.380]   But I was really into the Walden,
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:51.740]   real influential book for me.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.620]   So every day when I would walk back,
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.940]   I was living on Beacon Hill, walking from MIT.
[01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:57.540]   So people who know Boston,
[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.740]   it's going across the Longfellow Bridge.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:01.980]   I would say nothing but nature observation.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.180]   Like, that's what I'm doing.
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.100]   I'm just, ooh, the ice is thinner on the Charles today.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.380]   Like, look at this tree or the leaves coming back.
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.140]   Partially, I think what was going on is like,
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.660]   this was right after I'd been whiteboarding it, right?
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:16.660]   I think it was letting stuff process, right?
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:21.220]   So I had this explicitly in my routine a lot of time
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.020]   where I was, okay, I can't think about work at all.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.060]   I can't do anything else.
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.780]   But, you know, I'm thinking about the tree.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:28.620]   I'm thinking about the water,
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.500]   like really sort of minimal cognitive lifts.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.900]   And I wonder if that's what was going on there.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:32.740]   Like, to me, I mean,
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.940]   that was a very productive period of my life.
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.900]   - Yeah, I feel like in the last five, 10 years,
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:40.500]   thanks largely in part to Matt Walker's book,
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:44.260]   "Why We Sleep" and the advocacy around sleep from others,
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:47.260]   we've come to understand that sleep is essential
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:48.620]   for mental health, physical health,
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:51.100]   and learning, cognitive performance, physical performance.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.540]   So much so that now people devote immense amounts
[01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:56.220]   of attention and resources
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.840]   to trying to get the best possible night's sleep.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.900]   Whereas it was the, I'll sleep when I'm dead mentality
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:01.020]   prior to that.
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:03.140]   And I would love to see a world
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:07.980]   where people embrace not the notion of boredom per se,
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.620]   but the notion of gaps,
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:15.780]   lack of external stimuli coming into our eyes
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:18.460]   and our cognitive system as a means to get smarter,
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.220]   to get more creative, to get better.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:21.980]   We just need a language for this.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:23.060]   And I think it's the, you know,
[01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:25.220]   so often language is a separator
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.660]   when it comes to health and performance tools.
[01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.720]   And that's something I really strive for
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.980]   is to try and create language
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:32.480]   that's not linked to any one person
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.480]   that illustrates what something is for.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:37.080]   So maybe, no small task, Cal,
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.440]   but maybe we'll just have you rename boredom
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.440]   as a neural rewiring epochs or something like that.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:44.760]   - I'll come up with a term.
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:45.840]   My whole writing career, by the way,
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.920]   is based on taking things people already intuitively know
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.760]   in their gut and giving it a two-word name.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:53.440]   Just having the language around that really matters.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:54.840]   Like, oh, deep work.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.600]   Oh, okay, that's like this activity.
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.920]   I kind of knew that was important,
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:58.760]   but I didn't have a name.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.280]   Or digital minimalism.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.680]   Like, oh, yeah, I kind of know what that means.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.920]   Like, it's a different philosophy towards it.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.640]   But there's all, so I do have a name related
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.800]   to the gaps we're talking about,
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.800]   but for one of the other negative effects, right?
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:12.880]   So we have the positive effects you talked about,
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.400]   which is consolidation of learning
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.880]   and acceleration of learning.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:17.400]   We had the one negative effect,
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.780]   which was the Pavlovian connection to distraction.
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.760]   The other one I've written about before
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:25.160]   is solitude deprivation, right?
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.680]   So I'm using a different definition of solitude
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.620]   than the colloquial one.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.200]   Most people think of it as a physical thing.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:32.160]   I'm just isolated.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.600]   But there's a cognitive psychological definition
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.540]   of solitude, which means absence of stimuli
[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:40.640]   created by other human minds, right?
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.820]   So I'm not taking in information
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:45.960]   that's coming directly from another human mind.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.960]   Having no period with this solitude,
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.880]   so having no period in your day
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.760]   where you're free from stimuli created from other minds
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.160]   is solitude deprivation, and it's a real issue.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.520]   And partially it's a real issue
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.960]   because when we're processing input
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.960]   from another human brain, it's all hands on deck, right?
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.640]   I mean, we're very social beings.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.480]   A huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this, right?
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:11.680]   So it's a very cognitively expensive activity
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.080]   when I'm trying to understand another human's,
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.140]   what they're saying.
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:16.720]   I'm simulating their mental state.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:19.600]   I'm trying to understand, like, where do they fall
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.120]   in this sort of social hierarchy?
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.880]   And one of my arguments was,
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.040]   when you spend your entire day in that state,
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.200]   it's exhausting and anxiety producing.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.840]   And like, until we had smartphones
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.480]   and ubiquitous wireless internet,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.560]   the idea that you could banish all solitude from your day
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.240]   is laughable, it's just impossible, right?
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:37.380]   So of course we had a lot of portions of our day
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:39.840]   where our brain was not like ramped up in gear
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.440]   for the sort of social processing mode.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.720]   But smartphones makes it possible
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:46.200]   that you can be in that mode all day long.
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.040]   And so like, one of the things I hypothesize
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.600]   is some of the anxiety rises
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.560]   that goes with the age of smartphones is brain exhaustion.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.760]   So that's another negative effect of the constant.
[01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:58.240]   We have two negative effects now for the constant stimuli
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:39:59.680]   and one positive effect
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:01.800]   for the absence of the constant stimuli.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.520]   So I think we're making a case here
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.320]   for not always being on your device.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:07.320]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.560]   One of my favorite literatures from neurosciences,
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:10.880]   I think most people have heard of the so-called
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.580]   critical period stages of development
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.320]   when the brain is essentially hyperplastic
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.000]   to any input for better or worse.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.280]   This is a stage of life called childhood.
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.560]   And then of course, people throughout the number 25,
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.840]   after age 25, plasticity is possible,
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:26.480]   requires more effort, tension, et cetera,
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.600]   and then sleep, so forth.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.480]   But we know based on really beautiful studies
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:36.320]   that if you deprive someone of sensory input
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.120]   for even a few hours,
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.480]   and we're not talking about sitting
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.340]   in a completely blackened room with no input,
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:46.320]   but you essentially limit the amount of sensory input.
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:47.440]   In the period that follows,
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.120]   you get an opportunity for a hyperplastic response
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:52.480]   to any stimuli.
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:55.120]   And this just makes sense if you understand basics
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.040]   about signal to noise in the visual system
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.720]   and the brain, it just means
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.480]   when there's a lot of background shatter of stuff,
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.000]   it's harder to see the stuff that matters
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.440]   and the stuff that the brain's rewired to.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.560]   Very computer sciencey, neuroengineering type perspective.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.600]   But yes, I would love for you to come up
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.720]   with a two word description of this.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:15.480]   It's not boredom induced plasticity,
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.200]   it's this quiet induced hyperplasticity or something.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.960]   I don't know, maybe we can riff on this together sometime.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.240]   I'm not trying to move into your space,
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.420]   but I have a very practical question.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.840]   And I'd love to get a little more insight
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.000]   into the structure of your days.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.480]   But are you a list maker?
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.960]   Like do you wake up in the morning and make lists
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.760]   and cross things off and then decide
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.440]   what are the key items on that list?
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:37.720]   - No, I'm a time blocker.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.400]   - Time blocker, okay.
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.240]   - Yeah, so I'm not a big believer in to-do list.
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.080]   I like to grapple with the actual available time.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.480]   Like okay, I have a meeting here,
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.360]   I have to pick my kids up from school here.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.560]   Here's the actual hours of the day
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.300]   that are free and where they fall.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:53.280]   All right, what do I want to do with that time?
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.320]   Well, okay, now that I see that there's a lot of gaps
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.980]   in the middle of the day here, they're short,
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:58.380]   maybe there I'm gonna do a lot of small,
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.620]   non-comically demanding thing.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.320]   Oh, this first 90 minutes in the morning
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.320]   is like the main time I have uninterrupted.
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:05.880]   Okay, so this I'm gonna work on writing.
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:08.840]   So I've been a big believer of this since I was an undergrad.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:11.380]   Like you give your time a job
[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.660]   as opposed to having a list,
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:14.520]   which is somewhat orthogonal to what's actually happening
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.360]   in your day.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.480]   And then just as you go through your day saying,
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:17.680]   what do I want to try to do next?
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:20.200]   Which I think is a lot less efficient.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.400]   - I'm gonna try your method.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.200]   I try and structure my days as much as I can,
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:26.740]   but it just never quite works.
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:30.000]   Do you work late into the night or you, no?
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.080]   - No, I'm a 5.30 man.
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:32.920]   - Okay.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.760]   So 5.30 p.m., that's it?
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:35.960]   - Yeah, more or less, that's my cutoff.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.480]   Now the one exception is if I'm writing on deadline,
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:43.100]   I'll sometimes, like if I need to get more writing done,
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.580]   I can do an evening writing session,
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.700]   which I got used to through long experience.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.220]   I used to write my blog post at night
[01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:50.660]   after like my kids went to bed.
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.420]   Now they're older and they don't go to bed as early.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:54.460]   So it's like the one thing I have left
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:56.540]   that I'll do after 5.30 is like every once in a while,
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:59.780]   I'll do like a 90 minute evening writing block.
[01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:01.740]   But I call this, by the way, this whole philosophy,
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:03.340]   I call fixed schedule productivity.
[01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.380]   I've been doing it since I was a grad student.
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:07.340]   Fixed to work hour schedule.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.500]   That's my commitment.
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:10.340]   I work in these hours.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:12.400]   And then work downstream from that for everything else.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.920]   So like this controls like even what you decide
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.760]   to bring into your life
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.060]   because you know I can't go past a schedule.
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:19.680]   And it drives you to be more innovative
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:21.320]   in how you deal with your time and schedule.
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.160]   You have to be efficient
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.520]   because you only have these hours here.
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:27.960]   That's been a signal for my life
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.360]   since I was in my early 20s.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.560]   Fixed to schedule and don't work outside of that schedule.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.880]   Now it's your move to figure out anything you wanna do,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.720]   you have to make that work.
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.560]   You wanna become a professor,
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.800]   figure out how to make that work.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.360]   You wanna write books while you're being a professor,
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.460]   figure out how to make that work.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.660]   You don't have the option of just throwing hours at it.
[01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:44.020]   And you innovate a lot, I think,
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:45.740]   when you have the constraints.
[01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:48.500]   - Where do sleep and exercise fit into your schedule?
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:50.620]   What's your typical to bed time, wake up time?
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.300]   What's your typical exercise routine?
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:55.020]   And the reason I ask about this
[01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:59.060]   is because I think nowadays we hopefully people understand
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.380]   that exercise and cognitive function
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:03.980]   are inextricably linked.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:07.020]   And we're all going to live longer lives
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:10.560]   and be sharper mentally by doing exercise.
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.420]   - Yeah, so I mean, my main, like actual working with weights,
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.100]   I do this pre-dinner, right?
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.900]   And this was an innovation in the last couple of years.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:20.020]   It's fantastic psychologically for me.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:22.140]   This is a transition from work
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.380]   to like family time after work.
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.340]   So I'll do like 45, 50 minutes garage gym,
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:30.060]   you know, that we built during COVID
[01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.020]   after I'm done working before dinner.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.140]   And once you get used to that,
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.380]   like it also forces you, like I gotta finish work
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.100]   'cause I gotta get this in before dinner.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.780]   But then I'll do also quite a bit of walking
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.140]   if it's not a teaching day, so I'm not on campus.
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.580]   I do a lot of thinking on foot, you know,
[01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.820]   walking my kids to the bus stop,
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:46.180]   which isn't particularly close and back.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:48.060]   So I'll do a lot of walking,
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.180]   but that's when my serious exercise now
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.980]   is always pre-dinner.
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.540]   Then I wanna be up, you know, in our room by 10.
[01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:58.040]   And then at that point, I don't track.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.300]   So I have insomnia issues,
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.500]   which actually has been like key driver
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:04.020]   of a lot of the things I think about,
[01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:07.340]   especially with slow productivity is I'm very wary
[01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:10.820]   because I can, without any control on my own,
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.740]   just find myself unable to sleep sometimes.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:13.940]   - Fall asleep or stay asleep.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.140]   - Fall asleep, yeah.
[01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:17.260]   I mean, I used to get it really bad.
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:19.700]   Not so bad now, but you know, it comes and goes.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.460]   That really affected the way I thought about productivity
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:24.140]   because it seemed like to me,
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:28.260]   the definition of just I get after it with a bunch of stuff
[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:29.780]   wasn't really on the table
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.660]   because if my notion of productivity depended on me,
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.620]   like every day being able to just like hammer
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.500]   on a bunch of stuff, I'm very busy,
[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:37.780]   I have lots of commitments,
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:39.900]   what would happen if I couldn't sleep?
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:40.940]   I wouldn't be able to do that.
[01:45:40.940 --> 01:45:44.300]   So I drifted naturally towards a definition of productivity,
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.980]   which was it doesn't really matter if you work tomorrow,
[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:49.940]   but it is important that like this month you work,
[01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:50.780]   like writing a book.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.660]   It doesn't matter if you work on your book chapter
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:54.820]   tomorrow in particular, but like this month,
[01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:56.220]   you have to spend a lot of time working on it.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:59.700]   So it was like an insomnia compatible definition
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:01.020]   of productivity was sort of morphed
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.380]   into this idea of slow productivity,
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.020]   taking your time with it.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:06.500]   So it's interesting, so like sleep issues
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.260]   really shaped the way I thought about work
[01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:10.960]   and put me on these much longer timescales of productivity.
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:14.260]   Try not to be dependent on any particular day
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:15.300]   being critical to what you do.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:17.180]   I don't want the high stress situation.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.620]   I don't want the like, I'm just gonna 10 hours a day
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:22.660]   for the next 10 days, we're gonna make this deal happen.
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.300]   Like I can't operate in that space
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:27.280]   'cause I worry about it anytime my brain could betray me
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.620]   and I could like lose sleep for a couple of days.
[01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:31.660]   - I think it's really important that you're sharing this
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.420]   because while people's challenges differ,
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:37.740]   I think oftentimes people hear the content of my podcast
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:39.220]   or other podcasts and think,
[01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:41.860]   oh gosh, I have to have everything dialed in just right.
[01:46:41.860 --> 01:46:44.500]   When in fact, most all of the tools and protocols
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:47.980]   that have been discussed on the Huberman Lab podcast
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:51.500]   are in response to a particular challenge that I've had
[01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:53.320]   or that others close to me have had.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.460]   And I love this, I'm sorry that you suffer from insomnia.
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:00.580]   We have a series on sleep with Matt Walker
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.820]   in which he lays out some great tools
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.340]   that we haven't yet discussed on the podcast.
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:07.060]   I'll just send you, I'll text you,
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:09.740]   I'll call you with a short list of those
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:10.560]   and hopefully they'll help.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.060]   But as we do cover insomnia in some depth,
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.900]   but I think it's important that people realize
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.380]   that they can be very productive
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:18.660]   with the hours that they have
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.060]   and the moments or hours of high focus clarity
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.520]   that they have, even if they're not sleeping great,
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.140]   even if they're raising small children
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.180]   because that's the real world.
[01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:33.340]   And certainly that's the real world of deadlines
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.340]   and academia, but family and colds and flus
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:41.660]   and travel and jet lag and arguments
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:44.180]   and all the happy stuff too, vacations.
[01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:47.860]   So sounds like you're very good at adapting your day
[01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:49.540]   to what's going on around it,
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:52.420]   but that you have certain sort of committed time.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.500]   Am I correct in assuming that you have
[01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:59.260]   at least one period of say 60 to 90 minutes
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:02.540]   of real, what you would call deep work,
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:04.140]   let's say at least five days a week.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:05.580]   I know that might be an underestimate,
[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:09.380]   but it seems like that's what I'm extracting from this.
[01:48:09.380 --> 01:48:10.240]   - That's the goal, right?
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.860]   So to me, depending on the season
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:14.400]   is how extreme that can get.
[01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.700]   So the busiest season would be like a teaching semester.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:19.740]   Right, but even then I'm gonna make sure
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:21.620]   that five days a week, I'm starting with deep work
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:24.540]   and the non-teaching days are more than the teaching days.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.380]   Compare that to the summer, for example,
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.660]   where like all I do for the most part is deep work.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:30.540]   No meetings on Mondays and Fridays.
[01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:34.140]   All admin stuff is midday to early afternoon,
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.800]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:37.260]   Everything else is deep work.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:39.660]   You know, just locked in hours at a time.
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.500]   But I want, if I'm not getting five days,
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:46.820]   five days of starting the day with deep work, I'm unhappy.
[01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.180]   Right, because I mean, I keep coming back to this is,
[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:51.300]   okay, because I'm not gonna be able to,
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.620]   I mean, fortunately the insomnia doesn't bother me in years,
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.140]   but the threat of it like completely shaped
[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.420]   the way I think about things.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.860]   And because I know I'm never gonna be,
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:02.100]   have sort of like an Elon Musk style energy
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.940]   of like I can just take on seven companies
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:04.860]   and make it happen, right?
[01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:06.920]   I just don't have that ability.
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.540]   I've always focused on the long game.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:10.620]   And to me, the long game plays out with
[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.500]   get your deep work time in.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.740]   You know, just keep working on the stuff you do best
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.820]   and get better at it.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.380]   You know, tomorrow doesn't matter.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.900]   But if you're doing this most days for the next four months,
[01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:22.300]   like that's gonna matter, you know?
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.740]   And so I often think about productivity in my own life
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:26.260]   at the scale of decades.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.900]   Like what do I wanna do in my twenties?
[01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:29.540]   You know, okay, what do I wanna do in my thirties?
[01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.920]   You know, what do I wanna do in my forties?
[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.580]   You know, and that helps.
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.980]   Like in my thirties, I had a lot of young kids.
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:35.620]   Like it's, yeah, I mean, the amount of time
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.500]   I could spend total working is like much less, right?
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:40.420]   But I could still think about
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:42.180]   what do I wanna do in my thirties?
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.460]   How do I make that happen?
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:46.400]   Let me make sure I'm pushing like on those things,
[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:47.780]   then everything else I can adapt to,
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:48.840]   I can give here and there.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.960]   You know, it allows you to be very adaptable
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.620]   when you're thinking about what do I wanna do,
[01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:53.740]   you know, for the next 10 years.
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:57.020]   It also means you're not on a random Tuesday
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:58.580]   chiding yourself because like,
[01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:00.340]   why didn't I get three more hours of work?
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.660]   That becomes sort of a nonsensical question.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:03.620]   And what you care about is like
[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:04.980]   what happens in the next decade?
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:06.300]   Which is, that's the long game.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.580]   It's not about, you know, hustling today.
[01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:13.060]   It's about I came back to deep work day after day after day
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:16.180]   when other people got distracted by TikTok, you know?
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.220]   Like I gotta, you know, whatever.
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.900]   It's that coming back to what matters again and again.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:24.200]   - Years ago, I was in a scientific competition/battle
[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.920]   and one of my tools, it wasn't really the kindest tool,
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:29.800]   was I would just suggest to the competitor
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:33.160]   great television series.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.300]   So "The Wire," you know, which at that time was great.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.680]   We won a few, they won a few.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.920]   But, you know, there's something very addictive
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.680]   about those Netflix shows.
[01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:46.160]   You know, I mean, they're unbelievably addictive.
[01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:50.380]   Just even seeing the slider, next episode slider come up,
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:51.520]   you can skip the intro.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.520]   It's just like, they've just dialed it in.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.720]   - Just let it go, yeah.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.640]   - So I suggest those to competitors all the time.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.360]   Not, no longer, but then who knows what role they played.
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:04.440]   But I just noticed in myself how distracting they could be.
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.200]   They could take me to, when I started watching "Ozark,"
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:08.940]   I found myself waking up in the middle of the night,
[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:10.340]   perhaps to use the restroom or something,
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:12.720]   and then starting another episode of "Ozark."
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:13.880]   It was wild.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:17.740]   And I wonder whether or not a way to reverse engineer
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:20.840]   one's way to productivity, reverse hack,
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.080]   our way to productivity,
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.980]   would be to think about all the ways
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:28.680]   that you would benevolently deploy distraction
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.180]   for a competitor.
[01:51:30.180 --> 01:51:33.600]   And then ask yourself which of those
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:34.780]   you're still engaging in,
[01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:37.120]   and think of yourself as sort of in a competition
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:40.160]   with the highly distracted version of oneself.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.480]   Because I think that one task,
[01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:46.080]   I think for us today is to try and think about,
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.460]   for the person listening to this who's not an academic,
[01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:49.700]   who's hearing about all this distraction
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.420]   that enjoys some social media,
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.560]   how can they bring about the best version of themselves
[01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:57.000]   in terms of productivity, but also presence for family,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.320]   presence with self, et cetera.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.420]   And if one isn't in a competitive environment,
[01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:06.420]   then maybe it's about setting up
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.460]   different mental maps of the self,
[01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:12.100]   and then trying to pit them against one another
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.180]   and be the best version, literally.
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:15.180]   - I think that's interesting, right.
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:17.220]   Like think about what would be,
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:20.380]   yeah, I like this idea of thinking about my competitor.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:22.540]   What would really give me a leg up?
[01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:23.780]   Am I doing this?
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.500]   But I would also add in here,
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:28.300]   this is like a slower productivity type idea.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.900]   You figure out the thing you really care about.
[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:31.380]   You figure out what you would need to do
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:32.980]   to really show up for that thing.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.540]   And then if you're doing that,
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.020]   like give yourself a break on everything else too.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:38.860]   You know what I mean?
[01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:39.900]   It's like I'm this way with,
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:42.420]   if I'm getting in my writing time, I have to write.
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:43.740]   I'm very uncomfortable when I'm not writing.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:45.620]   I just write all the time, articles, books.
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:46.940]   You know, I'm always writing.
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.780]   If I'm getting in my writing time,
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.940]   then it's like, okay, the rest of the day,
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:53.740]   maybe like this week was kind of a loss.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:55.100]   Like the kids were homesick,
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.300]   or there was a crisis at the university or whatever.
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:59.940]   And like I'm just trying to keep that under control
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.940]   and like have good productivity habits
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:03.460]   and like don't context switch too much
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:04.460]   and don't be too distracted,
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:05.980]   but still have your fixed scale of productivity,
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.700]   like end at 5.30 every day and time block
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:10.700]   and try to be reasonable with that time.
[01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:12.180]   Limit the damage.
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:15.020]   But if I'm doing the thing that ultimately really matters,
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.500]   I'm gonna be pretty happy with it.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:19.100]   So it's like moving to the definition of,
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:21.180]   am I happy with what I'm producing
[01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:24.180]   away from a quantity metric and to this more,
[01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.700]   am I aggregating the quality reps, you know?
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:27.860]   And like, I think in weightlifting,
[01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.140]   this would make a lot more sense, right?
[01:53:29.140 --> 01:53:31.420]   It's like, yeah, there's a certain number
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:33.820]   of like a certain amount of time under load
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:35.420]   each muscle group needs to be on.
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.500]   And like, if I'm doing that, I'm happy
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.420]   if I'm weightlifting, right?
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:40.900]   There's no notion of like, why can't I,
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.060]   why didn't I exercise five hours more or this or that?
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:43.980]   And so I sometimes try to think
[01:53:43.980 --> 01:53:46.100]   about my core intellectual work that way.
[01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.940]   Like if I'm getting in the core deep reps
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.140]   and the thing I care most about,
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:51.060]   which for me is almost always writing,
[01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:54.420]   then like the rest I just wanna, it's like damage control.
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:56.120]   Like I wanna like do the other stuff well
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:58.060]   and like not get too stressed out about it.
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:00.580]   And you know, there's the productivity habits
[01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:01.700]   then that are about doing the stuff
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.220]   that matters and protecting it.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:05.460]   And then there's the habits that are all just about,
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.980]   let's not let the other stuff get out of control.
[01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.180]   You know, I find it a little bit easier.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.860]   I go easier on myself when I think about it that way.
[01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:13.420]   - Do you listen to music while you work?
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:14.920]   - No.
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.220]   - Well, the data certainly support not listening to music
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:19.020]   or if you do listen to music,
[01:54:19.020 --> 01:54:20.660]   listening to music without lyrics.
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.140]   - Yeah, you have to train even to get used to it, right?
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:24.740]   I mean, even to get used to music without lyrics,
[01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.620]   you gotta get used to it.
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.180]   I guess your brain's building the filters.
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:31.020]   Some people I have met have trained themselves
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.680]   to work with lyrical music,
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:34.320]   which I think it took them a long time.
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:37.000]   But I met a self-published novelist
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.020]   who does like a million words a year, which is crazy.
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.340]   Then he blasts, because he has four kids,
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:45.700]   he blasts Metallica in NASCAR earphones.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:47.120]   And I was like, how do you possibly write like this?
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:47.960]   I think he just trained,
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.140]   his mind has just like a pure auditory filter
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:54.700]   that is he adapted, I guess.
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:56.740]   Or maybe his books aren't that good, I don't know.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:54:58.020]   (laughing)
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.380]   But I like silence or like background noise.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:01.820]   But even background noise is hard.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.900]   I have a hard time writing at cafes, for example.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.120]   Like I really do like lack of stimuli.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.440]   - Do you use visual blinders?
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.800]   You know, like some people will actually do this.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:11.800]   They'll use like a hoodie
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.960]   and they'll be like really trying to tunnel their vision,
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:14.920]   which makes perfect sense
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.880]   from the perspective of neuroscience.
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:21.240]   I mean, your visual world strongly constrains
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.600]   the narrowness or the broadness of your cognitive maps.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.440]   - Yeah, I mean, I just have my spaces engineered, right?
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.440]   So like where I write in my library at home,
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.060]   all the interesting windows are behind me and over here.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.080]   I'm staring across two windows
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.360]   that just was right next to the neighbors
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.320]   and like just typically blinds down.
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.920]   - Well, as you say this, it just makes me want to shout
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:45.760]   that so many people
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.580]   who think they have attention deficit issues
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.120]   have probably just put themselves
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:52.080]   in compromised environments,
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.600]   which include smartphone apps and things that.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.800]   I mean, like there's absolutely no way
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.640]   that they ought to be able to focus.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.680]   In fact, perhaps the fact that it can focus at all
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.220]   is miraculous given the constraints
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.820]   like trying to run with shackles on.
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.580]   - Yeah, I mean, look, we're used to this
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:09.140]   with physical stuff, right?
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:11.700]   If we analogize to physical fitness,
[01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:13.540]   we're so used to all these details, right?
[01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:15.420]   Like it matters like what you're eating,
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:16.980]   like how you're sleeping,
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.700]   the details of how you train
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:19.900]   and when you train and how much,
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.780]   like we're very used to this idea that that really matters.
[01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:24.340]   We have no intuitions for cognitive development
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:25.260]   or application.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.980]   We like treat our brain,
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:28.820]   I guess because we associate it so much
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:29.780]   with a sense of self.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.560]   It's just this sort of ineffable connection
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.520]   to us as a person.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.040]   We don't think of it as much of an organ
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.680]   as like a muscle or something like this,
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.960]   but we don't have a sophisticated vocabulary at all
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:41.900]   for thinking about how do you do stuff with your brain,
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:43.880]   which is the, if you're in knowledge work,
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.200]   that's the whole game.
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.100]   Like the whole game is this brain takes an information,
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.080]   adds value to it.
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:53.680]   It alchemizes value out of mind stuff.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:57.640]   And people who alchemize value out of muscles,
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:59.280]   I'm a relief pitcher in baseball.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:02.280]   I know like my whole job is like to take a certain muscles
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.240]   on my kinetic chain and use them to move a ball very fast.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.800]   And if I really am very careful about this,
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.660]   I can have a multimillion dollar deal.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.640]   Those of us who do this with our brain
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:13.520]   don't have any of these intuitions.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:16.960]   It's just like, you know, you have to work hard, you know,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.160]   and we're on our phone all day.
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.320]   I mean, this has to be the physical equivalent
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:21.680]   if you had like an endurance athlete
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.140]   who was smoking all the time.
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:23.980]   Like this is crazy.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:27.040]   Like this is directly contra-indicating
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.320]   or indicating what you need to do.
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.080]   What matters, like what the actual activity is
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.680]   that matters for your value production.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:36.000]   But with cognitive stuff, we have no intuition like this.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.320]   - Yeah, when I was a junior professor,
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.020]   this was down in San Diego, not Stanford.
[01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:41.040]   My girlfriend at the time, she said to me,
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.320]   she said, "You're like a professional athlete."
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:45.600]   That was before I got tenure.
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.840]   And she was like, "And you're trying to go
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.960]   "from like minor leagues to major to go from, you know,
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.320]   "you're like second string to starter."
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:53.900]   It's like, you have to treat what you're doing
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:56.720]   like a professional athlete with their game,
[01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:59.040]   like prioritize sleep, prioritize food,
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:01.200]   prioritize time, prioritize, you know, it's.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.600]   And we, as you point out, we don't do that with the mind.
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.360]   We tend for cognitive stuff,
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.220]   we tend to assume that we could just flip a switch
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.400]   and like focus time.
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.280]   And I think that's in part
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:14.120]   because there are certain things such as social media,
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.640]   such as a great movie,
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.240]   such as certain social interactions
[01:58:17.240 --> 01:58:20.480]   that can immediately and completely harness our attention.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.040]   Unlike a marathon or where,
[01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:24.040]   sure, I could probably finish the 26 miles
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:27.360]   or wherever it is, 26.23, I forget what it is,
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:29.560]   if I had to do it right now to save my life.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:32.360]   But it's not like I can just hit a switch.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.760]   And I think that's the kind of caveat here
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.280]   is that the kid that loves video games
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:41.440]   can definitely focus.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.000]   Give him or her a video game they love
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.520]   and boom, they're focused.
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:47.920]   So it seems as if there's a problem when they can't,
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.040]   but they know they can, right?
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:52.760]   Stuff's obvious when one states it,
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.560]   but I think it's worth pointing out
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:57.440]   that this stuff needs attention.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.840]   It needs work.
[01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:00.840]   - Yeah, which means, and it starts with vocabulary,
[01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:03.200]   it starts with intention, it starts with examples.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.240]   I mean, there should be a book like "How to Think"
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:07.200]   that we just give to everyone.
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.040]   - How to think and learn.
[01:59:08.040 --> 01:59:08.860]   - And learn, right?
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:11.160]   Yeah, like how to use your brain, like the user manual.
[01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:13.360]   Like that would be a very useful user manual.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.000]   And I think in like elite cognitive professions,
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.560]   this gets handed down as lore and people figure it out.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:21.760]   I mean, like this was like my experience training at MIT.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.360]   In the theory group is that, you know,
[01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.520]   everything was focused on getting the most out of your mind.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:28.400]   And so it's being passed down from person to person.
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:29.520]   It was also in the culture.
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.360]   It was in the way that people acted,
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:33.080]   but most places that do cognitive work
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.600]   don't have these cultures.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:37.360]   Yeah, but here's the advantage though.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.120]   Like here's the silver lining, right?
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.560]   If you're one of the few who cares about it,
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.520]   it's a huge advantage right now.
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.560]   Like it's a big part of like my success.
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.440]   I don't think I have the highest horsepower brain,
[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:49.600]   but like I care a lot about trying to, you know,
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:50.480]   get the most out of it.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.480]   Like to push it to like the edges of like the reps,
[01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:56.120]   I can actually, RPMs, I can actually get out of it,
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:56.960]   you know?
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.280]   So it's an advantage as, you know,
[01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.760]   someone who's listening to this,
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:02.040]   you start caring about your brain, how it works,
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.200]   how you wanna take care of it,
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.480]   what you wanna get out of it.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.800]   You start caring about this,
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.080]   you're gonna get advantages compared
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.440]   to the person right next to you.
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:11.200]   Like suddenly in your office or, you know,
[02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.920]   in your grad program, it's gonna be like,
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.000]   well, what's going on here?
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:14.840]   - Yeah. - You know,
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:15.680]   a little superpower.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.680]   - And sometimes there's a bit of a social cost upfront.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:18.520]   - Yeah.
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.840]   I had to make the shift from being a,
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.800]   let's just call it a not serious student
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:23.520]   to a serious student in college.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:24.640]   And I was coming from behind,
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:26.120]   I had to put so many more hours in.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.640]   And so partying was something that happened fairly seldom.
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.320]   I still did it, but, and it was isolating.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:34.160]   - Yeah. - I actually lived alone
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.140]   in a studio apartment.
[02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.400]   I mean, it's isolating.
[02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.400]   You're gonna miss out on certain things.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:39.680]   There's some deprivation there,
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.720]   but you eventually end up in a position
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:44.200]   to do far more with your life.
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.560]   - Yeah. - Of course.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.120]   What you said a moment ago also reminds me,
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.300]   David Goggins, the David Goggins, no introduction needed,
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:54.920]   has been quoted as saying,
[02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.200]   it's easy nowadays to be exceptional
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:00:58.880]   because so many people are just distracted
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.120]   and wasting their time.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:04.160]   So you put in 20% more effort to being more focused
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:06.560]   or toward your fitness program,
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:09.520]   and you're gonna surpass many, many people.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.760]   - Yeah. - So it's not that
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:11.840]   hard to accelerate.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.680]   It's just, it takes some practices
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:17.040]   that are socially challenging to implement.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.120]   - It's funny, I had that same experience
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.760]   as an undergrad that you had.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.660]   Yeah, because I cared.
[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:25.040]   I was impatient to be done with college
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.560]   and to do things with my brain.
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:27.720]   I wanted to be a writer.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:28.720]   I wanted to be an academic,
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.100]   but that takes a lot of work,
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:32.560]   and I really cared a lot about it.
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:35.360]   So I was a fraternity brother for one day,
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.040]   and I went to the first meeting where they're doing,
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.400]   he was held up pledging or whatever.
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.120]   And I remember, I said, "This is not for me."
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:43.960]   And I walked away.
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:44.780]   I was like, "I'm not gonna,"
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.080]   because this is gonna be distracting.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:47.800]   Like the hangovers and this and that,
[02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.020]   and I wanna focus on writing.
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:50.860]   I wanna learn how to do this.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:52.380]   It is pretty isolating.
[02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:53.880]   - Yeah, and I know some people
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:55.320]   that were in the Greek system
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.440]   that also benefited tremendously from that.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.240]   I wasn't one of them,
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:03.000]   but I definitely resonate with it.
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.480]   - Yeah, yeah, so not everyone, yeah.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.580]   I mean, the good way of saying it is like,
[02:02:05.580 --> 02:02:09.080]   they don't all have to be as intense as you and I were,
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:13.040]   but caring about your brain, it gives you a lot of options.
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:14.700]   - And if you're playing catch up,
[02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:17.320]   there's almost always a social cost associated with it,
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:19.280]   but you eventually are joined by many other people.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.440]   You find the other nerds.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:22.680]   - There's a lot of nerds out there.
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:23.960]   - The other nerds, misfits,
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.040]   and people who are seeking something,
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.680]   they come around, you find them.
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:33.400]   I'm interested in this concept of burnout.
[02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.600]   We hear about burnout.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:39.540]   We associate with it too much adrenaline,
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:43.720]   lack of sleep, tired and wired, feeling disengaged.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:46.280]   The poet David White has a beautiful poem,
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.160]   I forget the title, about burnout,
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:52.040]   where he says that I think the cure to burnout
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.060]   is wholeheartedness.
[02:02:54.060 --> 02:02:56.520]   And I always like that, it's a bit more abstract
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:59.480]   than the kinds of things we're talking about today.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:00.320]   But I like that,
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.280]   because there's something about wholeheartedness,
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:06.740]   really leaning into something with the true desire
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.420]   to be there and to explore it, no matter how hard,
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:12.300]   that is the opposite extreme of burnout.
[02:03:12.300 --> 02:03:14.360]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think burnout in,
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:15.200]   if we're thinking knowledge,
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:16.880]   we're talking people with office jobs.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.640]   My diagnosis there, it's not exactly quantity of work
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.020]   that does play a role, it's the kind of work.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.480]   Because I think what's happening,
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:28.240]   what's been deranging, actually,
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:33.240]   for people in these jobs is workloads are getting larger,
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.860]   right, in part because communication is low friction,
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:37.940]   and we always wanna be demonstrating activity
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:39.320]   because of pseudo productivity,
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.760]   and people are always asking us to do things,
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.240]   and we say yes.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.120]   Everything we say yes to
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.760]   brings with it administrative overhead, right,
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.180]   which is talking about the thing,
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:49.020]   but not actually doing it.
[02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:50.760]   So it's like emails about the commitment,
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:53.000]   it's meetings about the commitment.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.200]   Because our workloads are larger,
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.320]   what happens then is more and more of our time
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.120]   has to service this administrative overhead,
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.560]   because everything we say yes to
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.000]   brings with it its own overhead,
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.640]   it adds up, it aggregates, right?
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.040]   So now more and more of our day
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.680]   is spent talking about work,
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.760]   and not actually doing the work,
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:08.760]   and to make it even worse,
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:11.520]   it's not like this overhead is all batched together,
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:14.080]   it's sort of spread out throughout your day,
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.700]   so it's also putting you in that state
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.360]   of constant distraction, which makes it hard to do work.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:19.920]   What I think is burning people out
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.760]   is they're now in this state where they're saying,
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:23.980]   I'm spending most of my day talking about work,
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.960]   sending emails, attending meetings.
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.960]   Very little time is left to actually
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.680]   make progress on the work,
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.840]   and then the workload gets larger and larger.
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.920]   This by itself is deranging, right?
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:37.760]   It feels like you're in some sort of nihilistic experiment.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.620]   Like, what is this?
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:40.080]   Why do I have six hours in meetings?
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.520]   I'm not actually, this can't be the right way to work.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:43.960]   And then what happens, of course,
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.120]   is you have to recover time in the morning and the afternoon,
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.680]   maybe after your kids go to bed,
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.040]   to try to actually make progress.
[02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.880]   So now you also have just a straight work quantity issue.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:54.740]   So you're working more hours, there's an energy drain,
[02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:57.240]   but I think that psychological piece
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.160]   of this can't possibly make sense,
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:02.960]   that like I'm checking email once every two minutes
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.480]   and spent six hours in Zoom,
[02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:06.960]   like doing very little actual high-value work.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.960]   Like, this can't be the right way to work.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.280]   That's what I think the burnout epidemic
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:11.360]   right now is coming from,
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.320]   is that psychological component of,
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.120]   we all know this is stupid,
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.120]   but no one is saying the emperor has no clothes on.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:19.880]   We all know that the amount of email and meetings I'm doing
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:21.640]   is such a waste of my salary.
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.920]   Like, this is a highly trained brain.
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:24.880]   Like, I could be writing these reports or this code
[02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.640]   or creating these business strategies,
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.000]   but we're all just accepting this.
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.960]   So I think the absurdity of the current situation
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.680]   is creating as much of the burnout as it is just,
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:35.360]   we also have to add these extra hours.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:38.720]   There's just like a straight aggregation of work quantity.
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:43.720]   - It's almost analogous to taking professional athletes
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:46.720]   or would-be professional athletes
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:49.040]   and having them do a bunch of other physical labor
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:52.040]   so that they're showing up not fresh for the game
[02:05:52.040 --> 02:05:55.600]   and little micro injuries and distracted.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.440]   - And no one's admitting that this doesn't make sense
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:58.680]   and everyone's just getting injured
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:59.960]   and no one's talking about it.
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:02.040]   So it's the absurdity of it would drive people crazy.
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.600]   And it is driving people crazy.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.360]   - It's so difficult though,
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.760]   because certain things like smartphones
[02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:11.800]   are very useful on the hospital ward.
[02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:13.120]   I mean, doctors can communicate,
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:15.360]   nurses communicate so much faster now.
[02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.960]   Parents and kids can communicate.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:18.920]   Who's going to pick up the kids?
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:20.040]   Nope, got stuck in traffic.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:20.880]   You go this way.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.320]   Alternate route on Google maps and on and on.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:25.440]   So it's all woven in with stuff
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.800]   that's also highly adaptive.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.480]   It makes it tough.
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:32.200]   It's almost like the work of being a selective filter
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:35.320]   is half the work of trying to deload the cognitive systems
[02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:36.880]   that would allow you to do deep work.
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:37.720]   - Yeah.
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:39.960]   Well, in the workplace is even harder than that, right?
[02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.680]   Because part of the issue is email and Slack,
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:45.800]   let's just say digital communication.
[02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:47.880]   I spent a lot of time studying that closely, right?
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:49.840]   From like a technocritic standpoint,
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:53.120]   the introduction of digital communication to the workplace.
[02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:55.240]   And the problem there is the reason
[02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.560]   why we're checking this all the time.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:00.800]   It's not some like individual habit de-optimization.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:02.960]   It's not, oh, I should just check this less often.
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:05.120]   What happened is when we introduced low friction
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.080]   digital communication to the office,
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:11.440]   this emerging consensus came about that said, great,
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.480]   let's just use ad hoc messaging
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.720]   as our major way of collaborating.
[02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.440]   Like we can just figure things out on the fly.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.320]   I can just be like, Andrew, what's going on with the whatever
[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.640]   and you can answer me and I can send it back.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:22.680]   This was very convenient.
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:24.320]   The activation cost was low.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.920]   And so this is how we began actually collaborating on work.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:29.000]   Now what happens is as workloads get higher,
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.040]   we now have many things at the same time.
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.680]   They're all generating these asynchronous
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.400]   back and forth conversations.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:37.040]   Most of these have some sort of time sensitivity, right?
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:38.440]   So if I email you and say like,
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:40.640]   what's going on with like the guests coming later today,
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:44.200]   we have to kind of resolve this before later today.
[02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.840]   So now it's not just that these messages
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:47.880]   are going back and forth with all these different threads,
[02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:49.440]   but I have to keep checking my inbox
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:51.160]   to make sure the gap's not too big.
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.760]   This is not a failure of habits.
[02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:53.840]   It's not a moral failure.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:56.720]   It's necessitated by the fact
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:58.400]   that all these back and forth conversations
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.200]   have to keep moving forward.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.880]   So it is difficult then, if you're in this system,
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:05.680]   to step out by yourself.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.680]   Because this is the way we're collaborating
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:09.480]   is these asynchronous back and forth messages.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:11.800]   And I can't disengage myself from that
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:13.760]   without slowing things down.
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:16.640]   Like from a like a mathematical game theory point of view,
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.840]   it's a suboptimal Nash equilibrium.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:20.200]   It's not the right place,
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.560]   not the right way to run this.
[02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:24.920]   The utility value of this configuration is low,
[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:27.240]   but no one individual can deploy a different strategy
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:28.560]   that's gonna be higher value.
[02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.000]   We're stuck in it, right?
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.040]   And so now it becomes really hard for an individual
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.160]   just to say, I want to check my email less often.
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.040]   It's built in systemically
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:37.920]   into this hyperactive hive mind workflow.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.440]   And the only way to break free
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:41.400]   from the suboptimal configuration
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.360]   is to basically have the organization itself
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.400]   do like a really high cost change to the rules of the game.
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.040]   These are how we're collaborating now.
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:50.280]   We're not using email freely anymore.
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:52.760]   We're gonna use this system instead.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:56.600]   It's a very expensive top-down procedure
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.760]   to free ourselves from the suboptimality.
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:08:59.840]   So like in the world of work,
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:01.960]   that's partially why this is such an intractable problem.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.800]   I mean, I tried to write a book about this recently
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:06.360]   and it was really hard to gain traction
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:07.920]   because it's not easy to solve this.
[02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.720]   Like no individual can move out of this
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:12.720]   and you have to put in a lot of energy as an organization
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:14.560]   to try to change this.
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:15.520]   So it's in some sense,
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.280]   email is a more insidious problem
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.960]   than social media on the phone.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.520]   'Cause at least over here,
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:24.120]   this is my engagement with this.
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.040]   And I might have these moderate behavioral addictions,
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.880]   but I could make differences here.
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:30.240]   In my company, oh, this is much worse.
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:32.120]   This is like a systemic problem.
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:35.400]   It's an emergent deterministic work impact
[02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.800]   on a economic, social, cultural system
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.600]   that was completely dynamical
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.280]   and went in a way we didn't really expect.
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:44.320]   So it's a really tough situation sometimes,
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.080]   especially in the world of work.
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.400]   How do we get out of this constant distraction?
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.360]   It's why, you know, I wrote "Deep Work"
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.000]   and I was like, well, why don't people just do this?
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.360]   That's why they don't just do this
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:56.880]   because it's not so easy to reclaim this time.
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.360]   - Well, it's like when I was a graduate student in postdoc,
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.440]   I was focused on eating pretty well,
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:04.800]   meaning just clean-ish food.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.800]   And people talked less about that at that time.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:13.600]   I was also really committed to exercise since I was 16.
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.440]   People were less committed to that
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.000]   in the academic sector at that time.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.680]   Now, I think it's commonplace for people.
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.720]   Like, I'm going to my yoga class.
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:20.800]   I'm doing my zone two cardio.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.640]   I go to the gym.
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.920]   You know, men and women do this.
[02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.360]   I remember having like this, like sneak off to the gym.
[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.640]   Like, oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.640]   And, you know, you felt like a bit of an oddball
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.600]   if you were the one bringing your lunch
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.960]   to the, you know, the pizza luncheon.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:37.560]   Not that there's any wrong with pizza, I love pizza,
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:38.880]   but I was trying to eat well.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:39.760]   I have for a long time.
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.720]   I feel better when I do.
[02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:42.200]   And I'm grateful that I did.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.560]   But you get some weird looks like,
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:45.520]   oh, do you have an eating disorder or something like that?
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:47.560]   That's what people would say then.
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:49.640]   Now, people would probably look and go,
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:50.920]   that looks better than the pizza.
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.840]   People start to understand.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.880]   So, I think there needs to be a cultural shift.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:55.800]   And I think there has been a cultural shift
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:57.160]   around food and exercise.
[02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.000]   Certainly food, meditation, sleep.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.800]   I think people are far more accepting
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.120]   and actually encouraging of their workers and coworkers
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:08.080]   taking really good care
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:10.960]   in order to function better for longer.
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:12.640]   - Yeah, I think this is gonna be the next revolution.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:14.760]   And it's gonna be a revolution that's gonna unlock,
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:17.440]   we're talking on the scale of like a trillion dollar GDP.
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.680]   When we go through the knowledge work
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.800]   and have this revolution,
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.880]   I call it like the cognitive revolution.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.000]   Let's take really seriously
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.320]   how the brains of our workers work.
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:26.720]   These are our number one assets,
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:28.360]   not to be too mechanistic about it,
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.320]   but what is our main capital asset
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.720]   if we're a knowledge work organization?
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:33.680]   We have some buildings, but it's really these brains
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:35.080]   that we have employment contracts with.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.920]   These brains create value.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:39.320]   Let's take seriously how the brains actually operate.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.520]   And as soon as we do, we'll say, oh my God,
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:44.440]   these brains are checking email once every two minutes.
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:45.600]   What a disaster.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.200]   It's like if we had a car factory
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:51.320]   and we spent $20 million on one of these German robots
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.960]   that can put cars on the doors or whatever,
[02:11:53.960 --> 02:11:55.480]   and we just weren't taking care of it.
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:57.560]   And it was like rusty and it was dropping the doors
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.080]   and the production pipeline was going down.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:00.120]   It was like, this is crazy.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.680]   We gotta take care of this equipment, right?
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:04.320]   When we have the cognitive revolution,
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:06.680]   the sort of cognitive capital revolution in knowledge work,
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.680]   I think it's gonna unlock a trillion dollar GDP.
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:11.960]   I think that's how unproductive we've been.
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:14.400]   If we just think in the pure raw terms
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.560]   of brains producing stuff that's worth money,
[02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:20.320]   like if we're just like super deterministic
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.480]   and kind of inhumane about it,
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.760]   so much is being lost
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.680]   because we're in these suboptimal Nash equilibriums.
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:28.000]   Everyone just email everyone all the time.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.400]   Everyone's just on Slack all the time.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:32.720]   That when we finally have the revolution to get over that,
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:34.640]   it's gonna be a massive economic hit.
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:37.320]   And AI might play a role in this, right?
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.840]   Because maybe AI, once it gets planning capabilities,
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:42.120]   is gonna be able to take the burden
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:43.840]   of some of this back and forth planning.
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.680]   I think it's easier to get there with cultural shifts.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:46.560]   I don't think we have to wait
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:49.480]   to build an email capable chat GPT to do this.
[02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:50.840]   Like you could solve this tomorrow.
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:53.120]   This is cultural as much as it's tool-based.
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:55.080]   But I think it's gonna be a huge revolution
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:55.920]   when we get there,
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:00.800]   akin to like the assembly line in manufacturing,
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:04.080]   which was like a 10X improvement in productivity metrics.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.120]   When we figured out the continuous motion assembly line
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.680]   with interchangeable parts was a massive,
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.080]   it created this productivity engine.
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:13.440]   I'm using the economic sense of productivity now,
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:15.120]   you know, dollars per worker.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.080]   The economic miracle that came
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:20.120]   from this process-based industrial innovations
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:22.640]   in the late 19th, early 20th century,
[02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:24.240]   that the money generated by that,
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:25.240]   the wealth generated by that
[02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:27.280]   was the foundation of the modern West.
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:29.560]   Like the whole world as we know it was built.
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.920]   So there's these huge latent potentials.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:33.760]   And right now I don't think we're there with the brain.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:35.680]   And I think it's gonna be a huge revolution.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:37.560]   It's just difficult, right?
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.120]   It's not an easy revolution to start,
[02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:42.160]   but I think it's gonna change whole industries
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.760]   in ways that it's gonna be hard to even imagine.
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.440]   - And I think as long as there are individuals
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:51.440]   who either by virtue of lack of family or other constraints,
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:53.340]   or by virtue of just having more energy
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:54.440]   and requiring less sleep,
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:57.560]   because these individuals do exist out there,
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:59.260]   there will always be these individuals
[02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:01.840]   that can kind of apply themselves more than others
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:03.520]   in the sense that they can get in earlier
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.780]   and stay in later.
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:10.320]   And that trying to be them is not a good idea,
[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:13.480]   that we all need to optimize for our best balance
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:17.600]   of productivity, deep work and work-life balance
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:19.440]   for lack of a better term.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.980]   When I was a graduate student,
[02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:25.300]   I was really committed to my craft.
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:26.840]   And I remember hearing about a student,
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.720]   he's now a professor, a very accomplished endocrinologist.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:31.560]   I'll just give him a name 'cause he did this thing.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:33.040]   He doesn't know me, but I heard about this guy
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.000]   that had been in the department, Randy Nelson.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.680]   And everyone was like, he used to work 100 hours a week.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680]   So I was like, all right, great.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:40.680]   I'm gonna start logging my work hours silently.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:42.000]   I'm gonna do 102 hours.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:45.020]   And I ended up with a flu and an autoimmune condition.
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.480]   I literally had an autoimmune condition.
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:47.320]   I've never had one since.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:49.400]   And then I stopped working that much,
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:51.640]   started working "smarter" along the lines
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:52.960]   of many of the things you're saying here,
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:54.680]   although I didn't implement
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:56.960]   or know about all these tools at that time.
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:58.880]   And of course the autoimmune thing went away.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:01.260]   It was a fairly minor thing, never had it again.
[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:05.440]   But you can destroy yourself simply by working more,
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:06.580]   even if it's deep work.
[02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:08.880]   So that the solution is not necessarily more,
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.040]   it's just like with exercise.
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:12.640]   I mean, I guess that's obvious,
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:14.140]   but I thought I'd share that anecdote
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:16.680]   because Randy Nelson taught me what I'm capable of
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:18.120]   and what I'm not capable of.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:20.120]   - Yeah, well, the other thing that happens, by the way, too,
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:22.480]   it's not just who's capable of working more
[02:15:22.480 --> 02:15:23.360]   get these advantages.
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:26.200]   There's these other unpredictable inequities.
[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:28.840]   I talked at a law firm once years ago about deep work,
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:31.000]   and I was invited by a group.
[02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.020]   It was actually a group of women lawyers
[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:34.120]   who had a reading group.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.880]   And they said, part of what was happening at this law firm
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:40.720]   is that people who were disagreeable,
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:43.800]   like just sort of gruff and jerks,
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:45.600]   would get asked to do less
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.880]   of what they would call non-promotable activities,
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.480]   or can you organize this or whatever,
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:52.120]   which meant they had more time to do deep work,
[02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:54.840]   which meant they would do better and they would rise faster.
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:55.880]   And then what was happening then
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:57.800]   was you had accidentally built a system that said,
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:00.040]   let's make sure we have a fast track
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:02.480]   for like our most disagreeable employees
[02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:03.960]   to the partnership level,
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:05.920]   where actually you need to be pretty agreeable
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:09.440]   because your client acquisition is really on the partners.
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:13.960]   And so they accidentally had pushed towards this inequity.
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.720]   And these type of inequities happen all the time
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:17.600]   when we leave it like haphazard.
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.440]   And okay, so who's doing less work?
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:21.400]   It's like, well, I just sort of like,
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:22.920]   I'm gruff and people don't like me,
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:24.280]   or I have something going on at my house
[02:16:24.280 --> 02:16:26.560]   that means I don't have the same time to do this.
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:29.040]   And you end up pushing people up these paths
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:30.920]   that might not be who you really wanna select
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:33.000]   because you're selecting for things
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.840]   that are sort of unrelated
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.440]   to their actual underlying talent
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:38.240]   or like how much they can actually produce.
[02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.800]   And so I'm with you on that.
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:42.080]   - Yeah, it's a complex problem,
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.240]   but a tractable one nonetheless.
[02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:46.360]   I'm interested in your thoughts on remote work
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.280]   versus in-person work and the hybrid model.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:53.320]   I've heard about a hybrid model recently,
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.520]   a friend who owns a big record company here in Los Angeles
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.000]   said that they require one in-person day per week
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.140]   unless on sick leave.
[02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:06.800]   They require one at home day per week.
[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:10.160]   And then the other days, it's at your discretion.
[02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:11.760]   It's kind of an interesting model
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:13.160]   for in a five-day-a-week model.
[02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.720]   - Yeah, I mean, my proposals,
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:17.680]   I've thought about this a lot,
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.880]   is, okay, if you're gonna do hybrid work,
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:22.240]   and I proposed this in Atlantic article recently,
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:24.480]   which created some positive, some negative waves.
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:26.320]   I was like, here's the way you should do it.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:27.920]   Synchronize the schedule.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:30.640]   Here's at-home days, here's an office days, but-
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:32.560]   - For everybody. - For everybody.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:33.720]   Or have a few of these schedules,
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:35.560]   but like groups of people who work together
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:36.640]   have the same schedule.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:40.400]   But then make the rule, at-home days, no meetings, no email.
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.240]   Like, that's the way to really get the full benefit
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.080]   out of hybrid work.
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:45.400]   When we're in the office, we have meetings,
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:46.400]   and we can talk about work.
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.840]   And we're at home, we're just doing work,
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:49.120]   and we can do it without distraction,
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:51.400]   and we can just stay deep and really turn through things.
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:52.560]   I think it would really make a big difference
[02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:53.440]   on the overload issue.
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.140]   I think it would be much more sustainable.
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:57.960]   Remote work, 'cause I did a lot of coverage of remote work
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:00.320]   as this was first emerging, the early pandemic.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:02.040]   There, I became convinced.
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.320]   I was doing this twice-a-month column
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:04.240]   for "The New Yorker" back then
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:07.520]   that was just looking at the pandemic transforming work.
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:08.920]   And I came away with the idea
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:13.360]   that remote work can be fantastic, but it's difficult.
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:16.840]   And it can't just be, do the job you were doing in person,
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:18.080]   but just do it at home.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:19.720]   And we have Zoom, and we'll figure it out.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.600]   Like, if you're gonna be fully remote,
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:24.200]   we have to rethink what work means for that.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.240]   And there's a lot of differences it needs to have.
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:28.320]   It needs to be way more structured.
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:31.240]   It probably needs to be, you're working on less things.
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:33.320]   It's very clear what you're working on.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:35.360]   The collaboration is much more defined
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:36.520]   and much less frequent.
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:38.160]   You probably need to be freed
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:40.120]   from the sort of hyperactive hive mind dance
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:41.480]   of we're just emailing each other all day
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:42.800]   and in Zoom meetings all day.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:45.280]   You have to sort of reconstitute
[02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:48.360]   what a remote work job is, I think, before it works.
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:49.200]   And we know this in part
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.840]   because software developers pre-pandemic
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:53.160]   were one of the only knowledge sectors
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:56.760]   to have a really successful track record with remote work.
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:58.640]   That is the only sector within knowledge work
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:01.140]   where we had large companies fully remote.
[02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:03.260]   They did that because their jobs,
[02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:06.040]   they had really structured them
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:09.560]   around these agile workload management systems
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.560]   where, okay, here's when we talk about work.
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:12.760]   Here's how long it takes.
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.080]   Here's how we assign you new work.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.280]   You work on one thing at a time.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.400]   You sprint till it's done.
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:18.440]   They had all this structure around work,
[02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:19.320]   which then it didn't really matter
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.240]   if you were in the office or not.
[02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:21.760]   So the less structured work is,
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:24.120]   the more free-for-all, the more you need,
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.080]   we have to be in the office.
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:27.600]   So like, I'm a huge fan of full-time remote work,
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:29.480]   but I think those jobs have to look very different
[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:32.280]   than like a standard 2019 job.
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:35.920]   - Yeah, I've always done a hybrid of remote work.
[02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:38.620]   I used to take Wednesday mornings at home from the lab,
[02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.700]   but nowadays it's wild
[02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:44.000]   because especially during the pandemic, but still now,
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.100]   I mean, you can do the whole day in pajamas
[02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:47.140]   and getting work done.
[02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:51.940]   And I love this idea of no email
[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:54.080]   and limiting text and social media
[02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:55.220]   while at home doing work
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.220]   to really extract the most out of it.
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:00.340]   Are there any data maybe from the pandemic era
[02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:04.820]   or prior or beyond about Zoom and things like it
[02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:08.100]   in terms of how they enhance or diminish
[02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:10.620]   or perhaps have no effect on productivity?
[02:20:10.620 --> 02:20:13.700]   Like Zoom specifically and meetings.
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:17.020]   We just found ourselves in Zoom all the time for a while.
[02:20:17.020 --> 02:20:18.220]   - That was the bigger problem.
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:19.920]   I mean, so there is data that says,
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:21.820]   for example, a hybrid meeting,
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:23.740]   some people are online, some people aren't.
[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:25.160]   These are less effective meetings.
[02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:26.980]   They don't work as well.
[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:29.820]   But the bigger problem with Zoom, I think, was the quantity.
[02:20:29.820 --> 02:20:33.840]   And part of it was just the technology involved, right?
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:36.260]   So if we're in the office together
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:38.580]   and I have a relatively quick thing to talk to you about,
[02:20:38.580 --> 02:20:40.340]   I can just grab you and we can talk about this.
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:42.140]   And the footprint's gonna be five minutes,
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:43.420]   but it's not just that it's five minutes,
[02:20:43.420 --> 02:20:45.540]   it's five well-allocated minutes,
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:47.700]   'cause I'm probably gonna use the social cues
[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:48.620]   of your door's open
[02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:51.020]   or you're going to get coffee anyways, right?
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.020]   In the Zoom era, instead we would say,
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:54.780]   well, we should set up a meeting, right?
[02:20:54.780 --> 02:20:56.660]   'Cause we have to talk about this.
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:20:58.600]   But if you think about a standard online calendar,
[02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:00.300]   it's difficult to have a meeting
[02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:01.460]   that's less than 30 minutes long.
[02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:02.900]   I mean, you just, you have to drag it, you know?
[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:04.660]   I mean, 30 minutes is like the default
[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:06.660]   smallest length meeting.
[02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:08.580]   So we're taking a lot of informal back and forth
[02:21:08.580 --> 02:21:09.540]   and inflating the time.
[02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:11.060]   I think that was part of it.
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:14.060]   So we just had too much Zoom going on, right?
[02:21:14.060 --> 02:21:16.160]   If it was just, I do one meeting a week,
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:18.260]   now it's on Zoom, it used to be in person.
[02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:20.020]   We were all on Zoom, we used to all be in person.
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:21.140]   That's not that big of a deal.
[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:23.500]   It's maybe like a slightly less effective meeting,
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:25.100]   but it's fine, it's good enough.
[02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:27.780]   But if it's, I have 4X more meetings than I used to
[02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:29.680]   because of the inherent inefficiencies
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:31.200]   of having to go to pre-scheduled virtual
[02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:32.900]   for basically all collaboration,
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:34.600]   that could be a huge problem.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.240]   The data I saw from Microsoft,
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:40.120]   the last data I saw was a 252% increase
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:42.600]   in these meetings from 2020 to now.
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.840]   And it's not a number, it's not like it peaked
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:46.180]   and then it started coming back down again
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:47.840]   once we went to hybrid.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:50.360]   It's just high and it's still creeping up, right?
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:53.480]   That's a lot of time that just vanished.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.280]   And we sort of pretend like it didn't,
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.540]   but that's a lot of time that is not actively working
[02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:00.540]   on things and just talking about work
[02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:02.260]   or talking about other stuff
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:03.780]   while we get around to talking about work.
[02:22:03.780 --> 02:22:05.780]   I think it's a real issue.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:09.160]   - Is there a top three list of things
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:10.900]   that if you had a magic wand,
[02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:15.580]   you would see everyone do each day?
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:18.420]   You know, if you had three wishes.
[02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:20.140]   - Yes.
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:20.980]   - What would they be?
[02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:22.060]   - Vis-a-vis knowledge workers.
[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:25.200]   - Vis-a-vis enhancing work creativity, focused work.
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:28.460]   I mean, I think you and I both clearly agree
[02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:32.260]   that there's not just great value in terms of productivity,
[02:22:32.260 --> 02:22:36.540]   but a great degree of life enrichment,
[02:22:36.540 --> 02:22:39.300]   like a deep level of enrichment in terms of happiness,
[02:22:39.300 --> 02:22:42.620]   feelings of wellbeing, time for connectivity with others,
[02:22:42.620 --> 02:22:45.020]   lessons about deep work that can be exported
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:48.340]   to time with others where we are really present, et cetera.
[02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:51.940]   Just so much to be gained from engaging in deep work
[02:22:51.940 --> 02:22:53.900]   and things like it that you've written about
[02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:57.580]   in your various books and talk about on your podcast.
[02:22:57.580 --> 02:23:00.500]   Is there a top three?
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:01.340]   - Yeah.
[02:23:01.340 --> 02:23:04.540]   Yeah, so if I had to do three, I would say, okay,
[02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:06.340]   first of all, with your workload,
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:08.900]   simulate something like a pull system
[02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:09.740]   instead of a push system.
[02:23:09.740 --> 02:23:12.100]   And what I mean by that is when you keep track
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:15.780]   of what you're working on, have the top part of that list,
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:17.980]   which is I'm actively working on these things,
[02:23:17.980 --> 02:23:19.420]   and keep that top part of your list
[02:23:19.420 --> 02:23:21.340]   to like two or three things.
[02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.140]   Everything else is in the bottom part of the list.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:26.500]   It's to work on next, and it's in an ordered queue.
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:28.460]   And so when you finish something that you're working on,
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:31.260]   you pull something new to take its slot
[02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.300]   from the list below, right?
[02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:35.560]   So what I'm trying to do with that advice
[02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:37.740]   is reduce all this administrative overhead.
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:39.580]   'Cause now, even if like you can't get away,
[02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:40.960]   you have to say yes to these things
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:43.480]   because it's the way like your organization works.
[02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:45.900]   The stuff that's in the waiting to work on queue,
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:47.320]   you say, I don't have meetings about that.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:48.860]   I don't do emails about that.
[02:23:48.860 --> 02:23:50.540]   I wait till I'm actively working on it.
[02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:52.840]   And I only actively work on three things at a time.
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:55.420]   Now, I'm gonna finish those things really quickly
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:23:58.140]   because I don't have 15 items worth of meetings
[02:23:58.140 --> 02:23:59.320]   I'm going to every day.
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:01.240]   So things are gonna pull up there pretty quickly.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:03.000]   And so the rate at which I'm accomplishing things
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.140]   will probably be higher than it was before.
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.300]   But I only work on three things actively.
[02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:09.040]   You could even make this visible.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:11.060]   It's in a shared document if you want to.
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:12.980]   When someone asks you to do something new,
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:15.580]   tell them to put it on the end of your queue.
[02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:16.420]   You're like, oh, okay.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:18.380]   So like Andrew is not working on this right now.
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:19.580]   He's working on these three things.
[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:20.700]   And there's seven things here,
[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:22.280]   and I'm adding something number eight.
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:25.400]   So I know not to expect something for a while.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.860]   In fact, I can keep checking this list
[02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:29.540]   until I see Andrew's working on it
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:31.220]   so I can see it's making progress.
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:32.660]   And then once I know he's working on it,
[02:24:32.660 --> 02:24:33.780]   I can start emailing him about it.
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.100]   We can do just a normal type of overhead
[02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.780]   you would have with projects, right?
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:40.940]   That alone is gonna have a huge difference.
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:43.100]   Like now the amount of distraction your day
[02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:45.480]   is going to plummet
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:47.080]   because that's generated from overhead
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:48.140]   of things you've agreed to do.
[02:24:48.140 --> 02:24:49.580]   And that's gonna plummet that down.
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.660]   All right, so that'd be number one.
[02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:51.940]   - Could I just, thank you.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:53.480]   Could I just ask a few questions about that
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:55.180]   just to clarify? - Yeah, of course, yeah.
[02:24:55.180 --> 02:24:57.080]   - I'll use myself as an example, selfishly,
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.180]   but then of course I don't know
[02:24:58.180 --> 02:24:59.620]   what everyone else out there is pursuing.
[02:24:59.620 --> 02:25:02.520]   But so substitute the specifics I'm about to insert here
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:05.500]   for whatever it is that you care about in your life.
[02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:08.980]   So researching podcasts.
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:10.600]   A solo podcast in particular for me
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:14.160]   is my major task in life these days with respect to work.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:16.500]   So that would be top of the list.
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:21.500]   And then there could be two other items on this top of queue
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:26.260]   would daily activities like exercise, social time
[02:25:26.260 --> 02:25:27.220]   with loved ones, et cetera.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:28.380]   Would that be included there
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:30.260]   or we're talking specifically about work?
[02:25:30.260 --> 02:25:31.500]   - Yeah, let's just keep just work.
[02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:34.180]   - Okay, so it would be, you know, podcast prep.
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:36.100]   - But you might have- - Podcast prep.
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:38.540]   - You might have the particular topic though.
[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:39.380]   - Right, right.
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:41.340]   Okay, so I'm working on an episode right now
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:42.700]   about skin health.
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:45.940]   - Yeah, you could have two different episode topics
[02:25:45.940 --> 02:25:46.780]   you're prepping.
[02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:47.600]   Those could both be up there.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.940]   - Yep, so skin health, allergies episode.
[02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:52.660]   These are two that I'm spending a lot of time on.
[02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:53.900]   Months, in fact.
[02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:54.740]   - Yeah, right.
[02:25:54.740 --> 02:25:55.560]   And then your third might be something
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:57.660]   that involves the media company,
[02:25:57.660 --> 02:25:58.860]   something around the business side of it.
[02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:02.020]   Like, okay, we're trying to figure out a plan for whatever.
[02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:05.820]   - Right, content for a brand association or something.
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:06.700]   Okay, got it.
[02:26:06.700 --> 02:26:08.740]   Great, so those three would be top of the list.
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:11.460]   And every day until those are done,
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:12.980]   they could sit top of the list.
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:15.440]   And then there are a number of items underneath those
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.360]   that fall under whatever.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.720]   - Yeah, and critically, when these other items come up,
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:21.600]   right, like, oh, this is like a topic, for example,
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:22.440]   I want to do a show on.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:23.720]   You have a place to put it, right?
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:24.560]   It's not being forgotten.
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.520]   Or here's a business idea.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.120]   We need to figure out, like, whatever.
[02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.200]   We want to do something with our camera, configure.
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:31.040]   Okay, put it on the list.
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:32.560]   So it's not being forgotten.
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:34.760]   Like, it's on there and you can see where it is.
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:35.920]   Not only is it on there,
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.280]   but like this could be shared among your team.
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.280]   So as people had extra information
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.300]   or things to add to one of these projects,
[02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:45.800]   they can add it to it on the list, right?
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.220]   So the information is aggregating.
[02:26:47.220 --> 02:26:49.080]   So if you use a tool like Trello for this.
[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:50.520]   - Trello, spelled?
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:52.400]   - T-R-E-L-L-O.
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:53.800]   - Okay, it's an app of some sort?
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:55.520]   - It's a web-based service that,
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:58.520]   the metaphor is just index cards in piles.
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:26:59.360]   - Got it. - Right?
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:00.280]   But they're virtual. - Okay.
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.860]   - But you can flip over the index card digitally,
[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:04.640]   attach files, write notes.
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:07.320]   And so I use Trello for my own organization,
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.160]   what I'm working on.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:10.720]   So now you have a place where you can gather,
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:12.880]   like, oh, I just heard about something that's relevant
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:13.860]   to this thing I need to work on.
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:15.200]   You have a place to put it.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.060]   Like, it goes onto the Trello card.
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:18.840]   Or you could do this with shared documents, doesn't matter.
[02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:20.400]   You're just, like, literally typing things
[02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:21.400]   into a Google Doc.
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:22.240]   - Or a whiteboard.
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:23.080]   - Or a whiteboard.
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:23.900]   - Right. - Yeah.
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:24.740]   Yeah, you could be,
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.080]   we're keeping track of these things, right?
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.200]   - I'm gonna do this, by the way.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:29.060]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I'm a big believer in this.
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.640]   And then everyone can see what you're working on.
[02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:33.060]   And then, but the key thing is,
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:34.240]   if it's not in your active list,
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.880]   you don't have meetings about it.
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:37.640]   And you don't have emails about it, right?
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:39.120]   Like, if people have ideas or things,
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:40.580]   they just add it to the card.
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:43.160]   So when that gets up to the active list,
[02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:44.520]   we can work on all the information there.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:45.600]   We haven't forgotten anything.
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:48.680]   - And what two-word language do you use
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:50.680]   to describe this first point, this method?
[02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:51.520]   I love this.
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:53.000]   - I called it a pull-based.
[02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:53.840]   - Pull-based, right.
[02:27:53.840 --> 02:27:55.040]   What gets pulled up?
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.440]   - You pull into the, so you're fixing in advance.
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.460]   Here's how much concentration I have to give on work.
[02:27:59.460 --> 02:28:00.860]   And you pull stuff into that.
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:02.600]   The alternative is push-based,
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:04.120]   which is how most organizations run,
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.340]   which is when I want you to do something,
[02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.280]   I just push it onto you, and now you have to deal with it.
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:08.800]   - Got it.
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:11.960]   I once heard email described as a public post to-do list.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.800]   - Yeah.
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:13.620]   - That made me scared of email
[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:14.760]   in a way that nothing else had.
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:15.600]   - Yeah.
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:18.120]   - It's Newport's pull-based system.
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.280]   I called it that, by the way.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:22.920]   - This is what, a lot of the advice in the first,
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:24.560]   one of the chapters of the new book,
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:28.040]   is basically how do you get away with implementing this
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:29.880]   when you have a boss?
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.080]   And there's like all sorts of different,
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.240]   so you're your own boss.
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:33.700]   You can just say, this is what we're doing.
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:34.540]   Here's the board.
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:36.360]   But there's a lot of like subtle ways you can do this.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:37.280]   Yeah.
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:38.120]   Right, so that's number one.
[02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:41.920]   - That's number one, Cal Newport's pull-based system.
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:42.740]   I'm gonna do this,
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:45.460]   and I'm actually gonna report back on this at some point.
[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:47.020]   You won't see the post on social media
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.700]   'cause you're not there, but others will.
[02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:49.540]   - All right, so that's one.
[02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:52.220]   All right, number two would be multi-scale planning.
[02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:53.360]   - Okay.
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:55.020]   - So now this is planning.
[02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:57.900]   You're planning on three different scales,
[02:28:57.900 --> 02:29:01.220]   daily, weekly, seasonally, or quarterly,
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:03.060]   however you wanna think about it.
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:06.460]   Right, so you have a plan for like the semester,
[02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:07.620]   the season, or the quarter.
[02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:08.860]   Like this is what I'm working on.
[02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:10.380]   These are the big objectives I wanna hit.
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:12.620]   Here's the reminders to myself about like what matters,
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:15.940]   like remember, like I'm overhauling my workout routine.
[02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:18.420]   We're trying to like do this with the podcast.
[02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:21.180]   You look at that scale of planning every week
[02:29:21.180 --> 02:29:23.180]   when you build your weekly plan.
[02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:25.100]   And the weekly plan, it gets free form text.
[02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:27.020]   You don't need anything, you know, any special tools.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:29.940]   Your weekly plan, you're looking at the actual calendar.
[02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.980]   All right, what for my bigger scale plan,
[02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:34.420]   my seasonal quarterly plan,
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:35.580]   what am I trying to make sure
[02:29:35.580 --> 02:29:37.100]   I can make progress on this week?
[02:29:37.100 --> 02:29:39.020]   And you confront the reality of your week.
[02:29:39.020 --> 02:29:40.300]   You see where it's the empty space,
[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:41.660]   where there's the busy space.
[02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:44.140]   You also change what's on your plate right here.
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:46.340]   You know, if I cancel this thing,
[02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:47.900]   that frees up that whole morning,
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:49.900]   which means like I could really make progress on this,
[02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.060]   which I really wanna make progress on.
[02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:52.700]   So great, I'm gonna cancel that thing on Friday.
[02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:54.900]   So you're looking at the whole week as one unit.
[02:29:54.900 --> 02:29:58.460]   Then every day, you look at your weekly plan.
[02:29:58.460 --> 02:30:00.260]   Like, okay, so I'm gonna use this
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:01.580]   when I make my plan for the day.
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:04.660]   And when you do your daily plan, you do time blocking.
[02:30:04.660 --> 02:30:07.780]   Now I'm giving a job every minute on my workday,
[02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:08.740]   not my day after work,
[02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:10.500]   but every minute of my workday, I'm time blocking.
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:11.660]   So I call it time blocking
[02:30:11.660 --> 02:30:14.380]   'cause you're literally drawing blocks around the free time.
[02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:16.380]   Okay, this, I'm working on this, this, I'm working on this.
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:18.540]   So you're making a plan for your day
[02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.940]   that is informed by the weekly plan.
[02:30:20.940 --> 02:30:22.020]   So in multiscale planning,
[02:30:22.020 --> 02:30:25.300]   you have like the big picture things you care about
[02:30:25.300 --> 02:30:28.300]   trickle their way all the way down to,
[02:30:28.300 --> 02:30:31.660]   okay, what am I gonna do during this hour, during the day?
[02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:34.260]   But you don't have to grapple every,
[02:30:34.260 --> 02:30:35.220]   this is what most people do.
[02:30:35.220 --> 02:30:37.340]   Every time I'm figuring out what to do next,
[02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:39.460]   I'm not grappling with all these scales at the same time.
[02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:40.500]   What are my objectives?
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:41.420]   What's my big plan?
[02:30:41.420 --> 02:30:42.900]   What's going on this week?
[02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.940]   You're dealing with each of these scales
[02:30:44.940 --> 02:30:45.980]   when the time is right.
[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:48.620]   And so when it finally gets down to, it's now three o'clock,
[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.100]   you're just doing what that block is.
[02:30:50.100 --> 02:30:51.580]   And you figured out that block earlier today
[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:52.700]   when you looked at your weekly plan.
[02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:56.060]   That weekly plan reflected what was in your semester plan,
[02:30:56.060 --> 02:30:56.940]   which you figured out,
[02:30:56.940 --> 02:30:58.540]   you spent a whole afternoon working on
[02:30:58.540 --> 02:30:59.820]   at the beginning of the semester.
[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:01.900]   So multiscale planning,
[02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:03.900]   it keeps you focused on what matters.
[02:31:03.900 --> 02:31:06.740]   It prevents you from wandering through your day
[02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:08.420]   and how you disperse your energy.
[02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:11.460]   And it gives you control over your time on different scales
[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:14.420]   from like canceling major ongoing obligations
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:15.340]   to just being more efficient
[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:17.340]   about what you do during a given day.
[02:31:17.340 --> 02:31:18.940]   So I swear by multiscale planning
[02:31:18.940 --> 02:31:22.100]   to try to keep this whole lumbering ship
[02:31:22.100 --> 02:31:23.740]   that is sort of like Cal Newport,
[02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:27.380]   aiming towards the right shores,
[02:31:27.380 --> 02:31:30.180]   keep correcting and keeping it aimed back.
[02:31:30.180 --> 02:31:31.420]   - I love this.
[02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:34.260]   This is more or less what I do with my physical workouts.
[02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:35.540]   Every week I know I'm gonna get
[02:31:35.540 --> 02:31:37.660]   three resistance training sessions,
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:40.340]   two or three cardiovascular training sessions.
[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:41.940]   I know I'm gonna train my legs once.
[02:31:41.940 --> 02:31:43.460]   It's either gonna be on,
[02:31:43.460 --> 02:31:45.900]   depending on travel, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday,
[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:47.860]   I'll train torso muscles in the middle of the week.
[02:31:47.860 --> 02:31:51.580]   I'll train sort of limb accessory muscles on a Saturday.
[02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:54.340]   Long run on Sunday or hike on Sunday or some other day,
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:55.620]   there'll be some sort of hit workout
[02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:56.460]   in the middle of the week.
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:58.220]   And ideally there's a jog in there too.
[02:31:58.220 --> 02:31:59.260]   - And you can adjust it a little bit
[02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:00.620]   based on the reality of the week.
[02:32:00.620 --> 02:32:02.460]   - Yeah, I might double up for two days,
[02:32:02.460 --> 02:32:03.300]   then take a day off.
[02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:04.940]   I have my ideal schedule,
[02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:06.580]   but sometimes it gets compromised.
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:11.020]   And then I do that for 16 week cycles
[02:32:11.020 --> 02:32:13.940]   where I vary the kind of intensity load, et cetera.
[02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:15.980]   And I've done this for years
[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:18.700]   and it's just kind of works for me.
[02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:20.620]   Now with cognitive work, I don't tend to do this.
[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:22.780]   It tends to be more deadline-based,
[02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:25.300]   but I think that the pull-based system
[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:27.100]   is really gonna help
[02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:30.180]   if I dovetail it with this multi-scale planning.
[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:31.020]   I love this.
[02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:31.980]   - And you can see the deadlines now.
[02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.380]   You see them coming, right?
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.220]   So that's part of what's nice about multi-scale planning
[02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:37.700]   is you know the deadline's coming up.
[02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:39.340]   And so when you're doing your semester planning,
[02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:41.380]   you start thinking like, okay, for the big deadlines,
[02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:42.380]   like when I get to December,
[02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:45.260]   I need to be really started getting after this thing
[02:32:45.260 --> 02:32:46.100]   that's gonna be due.
[02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:47.020]   - Yeah, I've got a book due.
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:48.220]   - Yeah, so then you know.
[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:50.060]   And so this really helps in book writing
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:51.220]   because now when I'm planning,
[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:53.500]   it's like a year in advance,
[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:56.660]   I know this month I need to get like roughly
[02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:59.180]   the rough draft of chapter two done, you know?
[02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:00.620]   And then that trickles down to my week
[02:33:00.620 --> 02:33:02.340]   where I'm gonna make sure I have enough time cleared
[02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.500]   to like be on track for finishing it.
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:06.580]   And then that trickles into my day.
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:08.580]   Now I know to like block those mornings to work on it.
[02:33:08.580 --> 02:33:10.340]   So it all works together.
[02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:14.020]   An added bonus of the daily scale is I would say
[02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:16.460]   communication should get its own block.
[02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:17.980]   Email, social media,
[02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:19.860]   whatever that's like you communicating
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:22.740]   with the outside world goes into your time block plan.
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:25.820]   So if your block doesn't include that, you don't do it.
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.380]   So it's like, this block is writing.
[02:33:27.380 --> 02:33:29.220]   It's not email, it's not social media.
[02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:30.420]   So the rule is really simple.
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:32.620]   I'm not gonna use email or social media,
[02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:34.420]   but I still need to do email at some point.
[02:33:34.420 --> 02:33:35.740]   So I have to put a block in for it.
[02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:38.300]   And when I'm in my email blocks, I'm doing the email.
[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:40.140]   If I need to go on social media to see what's going on
[02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:41.940]   with like the latest episode or something,
[02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:43.940]   I got to give that time.
[02:33:43.940 --> 02:33:45.420]   And then you can monofocus
[02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:48.140]   because then it's a psychological hack.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:50.740]   But basically when you particularly,
[02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:53.220]   when you schedule communication and distraction,
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:56.060]   now the only thing you have to muster willpower to do
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:59.460]   is obey the single rule of I'm following my blocks.
[02:33:59.460 --> 02:34:01.020]   If you don't do that,
[02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:03.180]   if you're like I just sometimes do email and social media,
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:04.220]   sometimes I don't.
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:05.260]   Now what you have to do
[02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:07.820]   is just constantly be having this debate.
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.100]   Is now the right time to do this?
[02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:11.020]   I know I'm gonna do it at some point today, why not now?
[02:34:11.020 --> 02:34:11.860]   Well, what about now?
[02:34:11.860 --> 02:34:12.700]   What about now?
[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:14.620]   Like you're just constantly asking yourself, right?
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:15.660]   That's impossible, right?
[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:16.500]   That's gonna drain you.
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:17.860]   But if all you have to do instead is say,
[02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:20.060]   my commitment today is to follow my blocks.
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:21.820]   And I get, I really feel good when I do it.
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:22.980]   And like, I check off a box.
[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:24.620]   If I do, give yourself some feedback here.
[02:34:24.620 --> 02:34:27.940]   It's a much easier cognitive battle to win
[02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:29.580]   than just trying to be reasonable about,
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:31.300]   well, let me wait a little longer to check my email.
[02:34:31.300 --> 02:34:33.140]   Like you're gonna lose that battle,
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:34.500]   you know, eight times out of 10,
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.420]   which is like enough to really overcome it.
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:39.820]   So that's like a hidden bonus of time blocking
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.700]   is now you can really get your arms around
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:46.220]   separating different cognitively distinct activities.
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:47.180]   - This is where the analogy
[02:34:47.180 --> 02:34:50.620]   of time-restricted eating comes to mind.
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:51.620]   - Yep.
[02:34:51.620 --> 02:34:53.540]   - Again, not that that's the best way to lose weight
[02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:56.340]   or maintain weight or it's role in longevity
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:57.580]   is still debated, et cetera.
[02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:00.860]   But I think for many people, not all, but for many people,
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:02.300]   the decision that they do not eat
[02:35:02.300 --> 02:35:03.860]   during certain time blocks
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:05.280]   and they do eat in other time blocks
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.860]   is just far more tractable in the real world for them
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:11.300]   than trying to limit portion size,
[02:35:11.300 --> 02:35:13.220]   decide whether or not they're gonna eat,
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:14.620]   they're gonna pass the cookie and have a little bit.
[02:35:14.620 --> 02:35:16.260]   Nope, they're in a fasting window.
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:18.740]   It's just, it simplifies the issue.
[02:35:18.740 --> 02:35:22.620]   And as a consequence, I think it improves behavior overall.
[02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:25.500]   Although the clinical trials point to some mixed results
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.420]   with that last statement.
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:29.220]   Again, I don't want the nutritionistas after me.
[02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:30.460]   - The point is the time blocking
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:34.780]   and the thick black line didness of the yes, no,
[02:35:34.780 --> 02:35:37.940]   the binary yes, no, as eat, don't eat.
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:38.860]   - It's a single commitment.
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:40.740]   - Email, communicate, don't communicate
[02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:41.820]   in a given time block.
[02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:44.540]   I think that really is what it's about.
[02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:49.540]   It honors the power of those sorts of neural computations.
[02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:52.140]   - And there's another hidden bonus of time blocking too
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:54.460]   is visually distinct blocks.
[02:35:54.460 --> 02:35:55.900]   So what I do, for example,
[02:35:55.940 --> 02:36:00.060]   is I put a double thick line around deep work blocks,
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:01.500]   focusing on some, not just deep work,
[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:03.740]   but deep work on things I really care about.
[02:36:03.740 --> 02:36:05.700]   Just this gives you a visual record.
[02:36:05.700 --> 02:36:07.420]   How much deep work am I doing, right?
[02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:09.100]   Like it's this diagnosis.
[02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:12.020]   I use a paper-based time block planner.
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:14.580]   So you flip through those pages
[02:36:14.580 --> 02:36:16.420]   and you're just looking for dark blocks, right?
[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:20.300]   So you see, if I see, I don't have a lot of dark blocks.
[02:36:20.300 --> 02:36:21.860]   I say, this is my whole job.
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:24.260]   Like my whole life, I've been trained in a lab
[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:25.940]   to think really hard about things and write things.
[02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:28.020]   Why do I not have very many dark blocks?
[02:36:28.020 --> 02:36:29.500]   You get this feedback mechanism.
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.100]   So there's all these bonuses
[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:34.540]   when you start doing this type of planning.
[02:36:34.540 --> 02:36:36.060]   - Before you tell us about number three,
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:39.380]   I often have fantasized about a web-based program
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:40.700]   that seems to run counter-current
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:41.780]   to much of what you're talking about,
[02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:45.460]   but goes back to the whiteboard MIT observer stuff
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:46.740]   that you talked about at the beginning,
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:49.220]   which is I often long for, okay, I need to write today.
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:50.060]   I need to write a book
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:51.620]   or I'm gonna do some podcast prep.
[02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:53.420]   I'm gonna pop up a few windows of other people
[02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:54.980]   that are also doing deep work,
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:56.780]   and we're not gonna communicate.
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:59.500]   In fact, if we do, or if music comes through
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:01.180]   on the microphone or somebody coughs,
[02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:03.140]   that's gonna be considered a distraction.
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:06.100]   But does anyone wanna join me for some deep work
[02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:07.380]   where we don't communicate?
[02:37:07.380 --> 02:37:10.540]   And I've often thought I would just pay someone to be there,
[02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:14.020]   to just sit there, but I haven't done that.
[02:37:14.020 --> 02:37:15.540]   - There are multiple companies that do this.
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:17.580]   - Okay. - Yeah, it's interesting.
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:21.020]   You're online with, or in person,
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:23.700]   with just other people doing deep work.
[02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:25.300]   - So a deep work club. - Basically.
[02:37:25.300 --> 02:37:27.220]   - The challenge is synchronizing schedules,
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:29.140]   'cause I might wanna do this with somebody on the East Coast
[02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:30.700]   and they might not be doing deep work at the same time,
[02:37:30.700 --> 02:37:32.360]   and a recording isn't the same 'cause then, you know,
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.300]   they're not really watching. - Yeah.
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.100]   - But there's something really to this, right?
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:36.940]   - Yeah. - I mean, especially
[02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:38.320]   for at-home workers or people like me
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:39.900]   that work often in isolation.
[02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:40.740]   - Well, grad students do this, right?
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:42.140]   Dissertation bootcamps.
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:43.760]   I don't know if you had this experience,
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:46.180]   but Georgetown does, a lot of colleges do this.
[02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:47.620]   Okay, everyone working on their dissertation,
[02:37:47.620 --> 02:37:49.340]   we're all gonna get together
[02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:50.740]   and we're gonna work on it together.
[02:37:50.740 --> 02:37:51.940]   'Cause they would often have me come speak
[02:37:51.940 --> 02:37:53.300]   at these things earlier in my career.
[02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.220]   It would just be a bunch of grad students.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:57.300]   They were just coming to the same space
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:37:59.220]   and they would work for like, okay, 90 minutes,
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:01.100]   and then they would have like a speaker come in or lunch,
[02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:03.540]   and so the group cohesion
[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:05.380]   of everyone working deeply at the same time.
[02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:07.040]   Writers retreats are the same way.
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.940]   We all go to the same house in the middle of nowhere
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:11.620]   so that we're all just gonna encourage each other, right?
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:13.460]   Because that's all what everyone's doing here.
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:15.780]   Yeah, so social pressure, I'm with you.
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:18.500]   I was thinking if I ever needed to, you know,
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:20.700]   put a big extension on my house, that's what I should do.
[02:38:20.700 --> 02:38:22.440]   Just like, okay, pay me money,
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:24.900]   and I will sit there on Zoom and do deep work with you.
[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:26.660]   This is my secret plan.
[02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:31.660]   - I'd pay money to do deep work in parallel
[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.980]   with you with a virtual window there.
[02:38:33.980 --> 02:38:35.900]   There's Cal in his office doing that.
[02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:36.820]   I think there's something nice
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:39.780]   about having some knowledge of who people are.
[02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:42.420]   You know, like, hey, logging in today.
[02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:43.700]   Yeah, all right, let's get down to it.
[02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:45.140]   Set the timer and go.
[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:47.100]   And then, you know, Asta, I'm out.
[02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:48.740]   - Working at the library, academic libraries.
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:49.580]   Why do people do that?
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:50.740]   - Right.
[02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:51.900]   - Everyone there is working.
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:38:52.740]   - Right. - Yeah.
[02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:54.340]   No, I'm a big believer in that.
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:55.820]   - There's really something sticky to that.
[02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:57.140]   Okay, number three.
[02:38:57.140 --> 02:38:58.940]   - All right, have a shutdown ritual,
[02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:03.420]   which clearly demarcates the end of work
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:05.900]   and the start of the night after work.
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:09.860]   And the shutdown ritual, so it has to,
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.020]   you have to close open loops, right?
[02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:15.180]   So you gotta make sure, this is like a review type period.
[02:39:15.180 --> 02:39:17.860]   Let me look back at my inbox and look at my plan.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:21.220]   Let me look at my time block and my calendar.
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:23.540]   Really make sure, there's nothing urgent
[02:39:23.540 --> 02:39:26.420]   that needs to be dealt with that I didn't.
[02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:28.860]   And there's nothing that's just in my head
[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:30.180]   that I don't wanna forget.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:31.180]   It's not written down somewhere.
[02:39:31.180 --> 02:39:32.620]   Like, take care of all of that, right?
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:34.180]   So you review all these things.
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:35.460]   You get, what am I gonna do tomorrow?
[02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:36.820]   You don't have to build your whole plan for tomorrow,
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:38.420]   but you have a sense for it.
[02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:43.420]   And then you need some sort of demonstrative thing you do
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.940]   to indicate that you finished a routine, right?
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:48.140]   So my longtime newsletter readers know,
[02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:49.640]   I used to actually have a phrase.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.720]   I would say, "Schedule shutdown complete."
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:53.820]   Like a crazy phrase, right?
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:56.140]   It's not how normal people talk, right?
[02:39:56.140 --> 02:39:58.780]   Now I have a planner that has like a checkbox
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:01.220]   that says, "Shutdown complete," next to it.
[02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:03.940]   The reason why that is a demonstrative anchor
[02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:06.740]   is that you use this then for cognitive behavioral therapy,
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:09.820]   'cause at first people have a hard time shutting down work.
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:11.860]   I mean, I invented this because I had a very hard time
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:13.480]   shutting down, working on my dissertation.
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:16.420]   I just, what if this proof doesn't work and blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:20.060]   So what you do is when you get a rumination post shutdown,
[02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:21.980]   hey, what about what's going on with our work?
[02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:22.860]   Are we doing the right thing?
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:24.180]   Do we forget this or that?
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:26.540]   Instead of engaging in the rumination,
[02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:28.180]   well, it's like, no, I think we're okay.
[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:29.380]   Let me think about my schedule tomorrow.
[02:40:29.380 --> 02:40:30.380]   What's my plan?
[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:32.580]   You instead can just say,
[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:35.140]   "I said that crazy phrase," or, "I checked that box."
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:36.580]   I wouldn't have said that phrase
[02:40:36.580 --> 02:40:38.060]   unless I had gone through everything
[02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:39.500]   and made sure that I had a good plan
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:40.540]   and nothing's being missed
[02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:42.400]   and it was okay to shut down work.
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:45.740]   Because of that, I'm not gonna engage with your rumination.
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:46.580]   I said the weird thing.
[02:40:46.580 --> 02:40:47.980]   Let's get back to what we're doing.
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:49.860]   This is like cognitive behavioral therapy
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.700]   that after a month or so,
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:55.540]   you are really able to actually effortlessly
[02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:57.660]   disengage from work and do everything,
[02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:59.300]   all the other stuff that matters, right?
[02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:02.180]   Without having the constant ruminations about work,
[02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:04.700]   which gives your mind an actual break to do other things.
[02:41:04.700 --> 02:41:08.140]   So, I mean, this is more mental health and productivity,
[02:41:08.140 --> 02:41:10.140]   but for me, it was critical.
[02:41:10.140 --> 02:41:12.640]   I mean, I can really remember when I came up with this,
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:15.120]   exactly where I was in my grad student career.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.200]   And there's just too many ideas and concerns
[02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:19.680]   that were just roiling.
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:23.480]   And once I did this, it took a few weeks
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:24.720]   and then I could actually shut down
[02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:26.720]   and go on and do other things.
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:29.600]   - Yeah, the paired associative nature of the brain
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:31.560]   can make it really problematic
[02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:34.200]   if you're thinking about work at the dinner table.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:36.120]   You start to associate the dinner table with work.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:38.320]   I mean, when Matt Walker came here
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:41.020]   to do this six-part series that's soon to be released
[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:43.660]   and we were discussing insomnia,
[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:46.420]   he said, one of the major issues with insomnia
[02:41:46.420 --> 02:41:48.580]   is people who have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
[02:41:48.580 --> 02:41:50.420]   will often stay in bed when they can't sleep.
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:52.220]   And then the bed becomes associated
[02:41:52.220 --> 02:41:54.340]   with challenges with sleep.
[02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:57.100]   Hence the recommendation that virtually every sleep coach
[02:41:57.100 --> 02:42:00.580]   and sleep scientist recommends that people actually,
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:03.020]   if they can't sleep for 20 minutes or so of effort,
[02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:05.180]   then you get up and leave the bed and go someplace else
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:07.680]   until you feel sleepy enough to go back and try
[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.100]   or fall asleep on the couch elsewhere.
[02:42:10.100 --> 02:42:14.100]   I put that in as a note to you.
[02:42:14.100 --> 02:42:16.500]   But this seems incredibly important
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:18.660]   also for enrichment of relationships
[02:42:18.660 --> 02:42:21.340]   with spouses and children and people in your life.
[02:42:21.340 --> 02:42:23.980]   I mean, the problem is the first thing that we ask people
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:26.500]   when they walk in the door typically was how was work today?
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:27.340]   Or how was work?
[02:42:27.340 --> 02:42:28.420]   What'd you do today?
[02:42:28.420 --> 02:42:29.460]   Tell me about your school day.
[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:30.300]   Tell me about your work.
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:32.380]   Maybe we need to come up with better questions.
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:34.820]   - Yeah, like here's something interesting we could do.
[02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:37.180]   Or here's like something I read about unrelated to work.
[02:42:37.180 --> 02:42:39.960]   - Yeah, no, I think it makes a huge difference.
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:42.620]   And again, there's all these meta benefits for these things.
[02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:45.720]   So one of the meta benefits for all of these is also,
[02:42:45.720 --> 02:42:47.760]   these are all very structured.
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:50.960]   You'll begin to build a reputation as someone
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:53.680]   who is very careful about how they manage themselves
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:54.520]   in their time.
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:55.480]   Like if you're doing multi-scale planning,
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:42:56.880]   and certainly if you're doing
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:42:58.460]   pull-based workload management,
[02:42:58.460 --> 02:42:59.980]   people are gonna start thinking,
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:01.820]   this is someone who thinks a lot
[02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:03.280]   about like how they manage their work day
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:04.400]   and how things happen.
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:07.580]   This gives you massive leeway, right?
[02:43:07.580 --> 02:43:10.140]   Yeah, because we think what like our colleagues want
[02:43:10.140 --> 02:43:12.260]   from us is accessibility.
[02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:14.060]   But really why they want accessibility
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:16.760]   is because they have no clarity about,
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:17.820]   are we gonna do this thing?
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:20.060]   Are we gonna remember to do this thing?
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:21.460]   Am I gonna have to keep bothering you?
[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.300]   You know what?
[02:43:22.300 --> 02:43:23.980]   If I don't really think you have your act together,
[02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:25.760]   I just wish you would just do this right away
[02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:26.680]   or respond to me right away,
[02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:28.420]   because I'm gonna have to worry about this
[02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:30.160]   until I hear back from you that you did it.
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:32.580]   Like accessibility is born from lack of trust
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:34.220]   or lack of clarity, right?
[02:43:34.220 --> 02:43:35.620]   So if you have the reputation of someone
[02:43:35.620 --> 02:43:37.080]   who really has her act together,
[02:43:37.080 --> 02:43:39.580]   you can, for example, lean into a shutdown.
[02:43:39.580 --> 02:43:41.000]   I don't do email at all.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:44.100]   And people, they don't think that you're being lazy
[02:43:44.100 --> 02:43:45.300]   or that you're not keeping up with the work.
[02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:47.740]   They're like, no, like Andrew has his act together
[02:43:47.740 --> 02:43:48.580]   with this stuff.
[02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:49.400]   I trust him.
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:50.240]   When you show them something
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:51.520]   like this workload management system,
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:52.540]   like this is where the cue is.
[02:43:52.540 --> 02:43:54.060]   Like, I can't get to this yet.
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:55.840]   Like, okay, that's reasonable.
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:57.000]   Like you have your act together.
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:58.700]   So there's this meta benefit
[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:00.480]   of starting to get a little bit more structured
[02:44:00.480 --> 02:44:02.200]   about your time and cognitive work
[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:05.680]   is that people will give you more flexibility
[02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:07.420]   to work with the better you get
[02:44:07.420 --> 02:44:10.060]   at actually working with the resources you have.
[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:13.580]   As your reputation grows, your autonomy grows.
[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:17.980]   - Yeah, and of course, as your reputation grows,
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:19.020]   more gets thrown at you
[02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:20.660]   and it probably takes a bit more discipline
[02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:21.960]   to enforce these things.
[02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:24.400]   But I always remind myself and other people
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:26.780]   that the reason people want to access you
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:28.860]   is because of presumably the consequences
[02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:31.060]   of the deep work you did.
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:32.720]   But people love meetings.
[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:33.560]   Gosh, do they?
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:35.440]   I won't do brainstorm meetings anymore
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:36.960]   unless it's with my close team.
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:39.280]   It's like, you can pitch me a contract
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.920]   and we can reverse engineer the idea, you know?
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:45.520]   But it just doesn't work to meet with people
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:47.000]   and kind of brainstorm stuff.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.440]   But I don't know what this is.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:50.960]   Like, I think maybe people are taking their own
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:54.240]   lack of structure and projecting it on to other people
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:55.520]   as a way to fill the time.
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:57.240]   - Yeah, pseudo productivity as well.
[02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:59.640]   Like, this is what I have, like visible activity.
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:01.180]   And so let's, can we have meetings?
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:02.700]   Let's talk, let's hop on calls.
[02:45:02.700 --> 02:45:06.800]   Like, that all feels useful when ultimately it's not.
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:07.780]   Like, I'm with you on it.
[02:45:07.780 --> 02:45:10.420]   Like, remember, the reason why everyone wants to talk to me
[02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:13.740]   is because not, I'm so great at brainstorming meetings.
[02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:14.980]   You know, people are like, this is great.
[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:16.820]   Like, Andrew's great at brainstorming meetings.
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:17.700]   So that's why we want to bother him.
[02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:19.580]   No, it's because you were really good at the podcast
[02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:20.940]   and you were doing like the deep thing.
[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:22.060]   And then that brings in, you know,
[02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:24.100]   the better you get at what you do best,
[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.300]   the more the world conspires to take away your time
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:28.160]   to actually work on it.
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:29.500]   Like, professors know this well.
[02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:31.900]   Like, pre-tenure, they, most big universities
[02:45:31.900 --> 02:45:34.340]   are pretty good at preaching to professors.
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.300]   All that's gonna matter is gonna be your research.
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:38.140]   - But they throw a ton of other stuff at you at that time.
[02:45:38.140 --> 02:45:39.220]   - It depends on the school.
[02:45:39.220 --> 02:45:41.100]   Like, I would say like Georgetown is very good about this.
[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:43.260]   They're like, we don't, from our perspective,
[02:45:43.260 --> 02:45:44.700]   it's a waste of resources to hire you
[02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:46.580]   and have you not get tenure.
[02:45:46.580 --> 02:45:48.820]   So like, we want to try to protect you from,
[02:45:48.820 --> 02:45:51.660]   they keep service requirements low, for example.
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:53.220]   And like, just focus on, you know,
[02:45:53.220 --> 02:45:54.220]   just focus on your research
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:55.060]   'cause that's what's gonna matter.
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:56.340]   And at least professors know this, right?
[02:45:56.340 --> 02:45:59.460]   Like, there's a clear process, like the tenure process.
[02:45:59.460 --> 02:46:00.860]   Most people don't understand tenure.
[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:02.900]   They think it's like getting promoted at a job
[02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:04.300]   and there's like all these different ways
[02:46:04.300 --> 02:46:05.640]   you can sort of impress your boss.
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:06.660]   It's none of that, right?
[02:46:06.660 --> 02:46:09.220]   I mean, it's these confidential letters
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:10.900]   from leading scholars in your field
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:13.540]   that are doing nothing but brutally assessing your research.
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:14.940]   How good is Cal?
[02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:16.740]   Who are two people who are better than him
[02:46:16.740 --> 02:46:17.780]   on the market right now?
[02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:19.540]   Who are like two people he's slightly better than?
[02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:21.380]   Would you tenure him at your university?
[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:22.860]   What university could he get tenured at?
[02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:26.100]   I mean, it's all that matters is, yeah, research quality.
[02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:28.140]   So you have to somehow rediscover what that is
[02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:29.460]   if you're not a professor.
[02:46:29.460 --> 02:46:31.660]   Like, ultimately, like this is the thing I do best
[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:32.940]   for my company.
[02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:35.600]   So let me do that, let me do that really well.
[02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:37.380]   There's also an aspect, by the way,
[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:40.540]   of if you do a deep thing really well,
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:42.740]   that does not attract as much work
[02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:44.500]   as if what you do is you're just really good
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:47.340]   at like responding to people's things and putting out fires.
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:50.340]   It's like, you don't wanna get too much trapped in that game
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:52.020]   unless that's the game you wanna play.
[02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:53.360]   You know, if you get trapped in the game
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.900]   of how I distinguish myself as I reply right away,
[02:46:55.900 --> 02:46:59.060]   it doesn't matter when it is, I make your life easier.
[02:46:59.060 --> 02:46:59.900]   You're playing the game
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:01.400]   of making other people's lives easier.
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.060]   And that's what they're gonna ask you to do.
[02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:05.100]   But if instead you play the game of,
[02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:07.720]   I'm competent with this, like I'll respond to the emails
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:10.840]   and not be, I won't be pathological about it.
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:13.240]   But the real thing you care about is like this code
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:15.060]   I'm producing or these reports I'm producing
[02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:17.580]   are just really second to none.
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:20.180]   Then you're not gonna get a much of the small stuff.
[02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:22.220]   They're like, okay, well do that then.
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:23.260]   You know, like that's what we want,
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:24.260]   that's what we want you to work on.
[02:47:24.260 --> 02:47:26.300]   So like what is your equivalent of research
[02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:29.220]   is probably a really key question for a lot of people.
[02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:32.780]   - How do you treat social engagements through work?
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.460]   Like, you know, like the company barbecue,
[02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:37.360]   I don't know anyone does company barbecues anymore,
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:40.180]   but you know, like happy hour
[02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:42.740]   or I don't know anyone does that either.
[02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:46.080]   And social engagements with family, like, you know,
[02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:47.980]   because obviously those things are important too.
[02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:49.100]   - Yeah.
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:50.660]   - Are those on your schedule?
[02:47:50.660 --> 02:47:52.820]   - Well, you know, I treat work schedule different
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.100]   from non-work schedule, right?
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:56.340]   So my work schedule is this time block plan,
[02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:59.620]   part of a multi-scale plan, really dialed in.
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:01.940]   Like when I'm working, I'm working, right?
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:04.940]   But then when I'm not working, I'm way more lax, you know?
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:06.800]   So I don't do time block planning
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:08.780]   of my weekends or my evenings.
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:11.140]   The work shutdown being clear
[02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:12.860]   gives you more flexibility there.
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:13.980]   So I was like, okay, what do we wanna do?
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:15.300]   Like, let's go like see these people,
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:16.800]   see these things with the family.
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.500]   I like to be flexible and not overly planned
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:22.180]   outside of the workday.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:24.980]   But then during the workday itself, you know,
[02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:27.340]   it's much more machine-like.
[02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:31.440]   - So you're fairly, not lax,
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.540]   but you're a bit more relaxed around social engagements
[02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:37.380]   and engaging with the kids, but at work
[02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:39.800]   or when you're working at home or in the office,
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:40.780]   you're a beast.
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:42.700]   - Yeah, I'm like a black box in the workday.
[02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:44.880]   Like when I'm working, like I disappear.
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:45.720]   - Nice. - Yeah.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:47.020]   And then when I'm done, like I'm around,
[02:48:47.020 --> 02:48:48.620]   but like my family and friends,
[02:48:48.620 --> 02:48:52.660]   and they've learned like if you text me during the workday,
[02:48:52.660 --> 02:48:55.300]   I'm not part of that game of like,
[02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:56.440]   I'll just respond back to it.
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:58.140]   People know like it may have been four hours
[02:48:58.140 --> 02:48:59.100]   since I saw my phone.
[02:48:59.100 --> 02:49:00.500]   - That's like Lex Friedman.
[02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:01.340]   - Yeah.
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:02.700]   - And people often ask to get in touch with Lex,
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:05.700]   and I've, you know, made that connect for a few people,
[02:49:05.700 --> 02:49:07.460]   but I always point out, you know,
[02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:09.620]   Lex will go long periods of time where we don't connect,
[02:49:09.620 --> 02:49:11.080]   and then we're close, close friends.
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:13.740]   We spend a lot of time in person, on the phone, text.
[02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:15.920]   But I understand that if I text Lex,
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.800]   I might not hear from him for four or five days,
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:19.180]   and it's all good.
[02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:20.020]   - Yeah.
[02:49:20.020 --> 02:49:22.020]   - You know, it's just, in fact, it tells me he's good.
[02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:23.940]   It's like that scene at the end of "Good Will Hunting"
[02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:25.440]   where he's like, I just want to show up at your house,
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:26.280]   and you're not there.
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:27.820]   And he gets there, and he smiles, his friend's gone.
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:30.940]   He knows he went the direction of his heart.
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:33.620]   - So you're saying if you start to get a lot of like memes
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:34.700]   texted to you from Lex.
[02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:35.540]   - That's not gonna happen.
[02:49:35.540 --> 02:49:37.100]   - You're gonna be like, what's going on, Lex?
[02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:38.100]   - That's never gonna happen.
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:40.780]   - What struggle are you having in your life right now?
[02:49:40.780 --> 02:49:42.060]   - I'm a big believer in the phone.
[02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:42.900]   I'm old school.
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:44.300]   I pick up the phone, make a call.
[02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:46.620]   We'll get on a call, sometimes FaceTime.
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:48.200]   We do text one or two things back,
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:50.800]   but it's often really quick, really quick.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:52.280]   And I have other friends in the podcast space
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:53.120]   for which it's the same.
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:56.160]   It's just, phone is a great tool,
[02:49:56.160 --> 02:49:58.640]   and, you know, drop in and then get back to it.
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:00.480]   Not a lot of chitter chatter on text.
[02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:01.320]   - I like that.
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:03.760]   I always like, text is like a great logistical tool.
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:06.200]   You know, like, wait, what restaurant are you at?
[02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:08.600]   Oh, you know, okay, I'll meet you there.
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:09.440]   Are you free to talk?
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:11.840]   Like, I love text as a logistical tool.
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:14.080]   But you're right, as a conversational tool,
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:15.200]   yeah, it's not for me either.
[02:50:15.200 --> 02:50:18.320]   - And do you take vacations where you are on pure vacation?
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:22.200]   So just with family or maybe even solo or with your spouse,
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:24.900]   where it's, like, no digital anything?
[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:27.920]   - Yeah, digital's not a problem for me on vacation,
[02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:31.160]   but my wife won't let me not bring something
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:32.360]   to work on on vacation.
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:33.200]   - Because?
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:34.280]   - 'Cause I'd become a monster.
[02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:35.120]   - Got it.
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:35.940]   Your brain needs that.
[02:50:35.940 --> 02:50:36.780]   - It needs it, yeah.
[02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:39.260]   When we had little kids, I tried this, right?
[02:50:39.260 --> 02:50:40.800]   I was like, okay, like, this is it.
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:42.260]   I'm not gonna think about anything.
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:45.400]   And I would just become, like, an anxiety case.
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:47.240]   So what I've learned is bring one thing
[02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:49.900]   that's, like, very deep and non-urgent,
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:51.800]   like a book concept I'm trying to make work
[02:50:51.800 --> 02:50:54.040]   or an academic paper that I was, like, trying to crack
[02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:54.960]   or, like, something new.
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:57.240]   And I need, like, that 90 minutes a day
[02:50:57.240 --> 02:50:58.720]   to, like, walk on the beach and think.
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:00.440]   And I have to have a notebook.
[02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:01.480]   I have it with me in here.
[02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:02.640]   I have to have a notebook with me
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:04.240]   so that, like, I can capture notes
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:05.720]   and get 'em out of my head on vacation.
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:07.320]   And now we have a happy medium.
[02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:09.520]   Like, I work a little bit every day.
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:10.360]   No email.
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:13.360]   Not email, not, no, deep work thinking.
[02:51:13.360 --> 02:51:14.560]   I'm much happier.
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:16.600]   - It's like an itch that you have to scratch.
[02:51:16.600 --> 02:51:19.040]   - Yeah, if I'm not writing or thinking,
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:22.280]   it's, I get cognitively antsy.
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:24.120]   I get anxious, you know?
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:26.760]   Like, I'm on, I've been now, I'm talking to you now,
[02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:28.120]   but I've been, you know, traveling,
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:29.560]   doing some podcasts and stuff like this.
[02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:32.880]   And I'm way out of my cognitive comfort zone here
[02:51:32.880 --> 02:51:34.360]   because I'm not logging.
[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:35.240]   Like, early in this trip,
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:37.580]   I was on a New Yorker and Atlantic deadline,
[02:51:37.580 --> 02:51:38.880]   like, writing all the time, you know,
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:41.240]   California time up at 5 a.m., like, you know.
[02:51:41.240 --> 02:51:42.680]   And I'm done with that now.
[02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:44.240]   And I'm really cognitively antsy.
[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:46.400]   Like, I just feel out of sorts right now, you know?
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:47.920]   Like, I'm not working.
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:49.000]   I'm not thinking.
[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.040]   - Love it.
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:55.280]   Cal, for me, this has been such an honor.
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:57.280]   I mean, I should have said this
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:58.320]   at the beginning of the episode,
[02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:01.520]   but I've been such a fan for such a long time.
[02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:04.760]   Long before we met or communicated at all,
[02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:06.840]   I started reading your books.
[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:09.000]   And I would say you and Tim Ferriss
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.400]   are the people who, early in my academic career,
[02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:15.180]   had such a profound influence on how I approach work.
[02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:17.280]   And it required that I do things
[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:20.120]   kind of against the grain, people around me.
[02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:23.920]   And very quickly, I saw that I was making progress
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:25.840]   much faster than I would have otherwise.
[02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:26.680]   - Yeah.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:27.900]   - And I never looked at it as a competitive endeavor
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:30.880]   with others, but, and you've just continued
[02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:34.640]   to churn out valuable information, actionable tools,
[02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:37.400]   you know, book after book after book.
[02:52:37.400 --> 02:52:40.200]   And obviously they require some structure
[02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:41.920]   and some restriction,
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:45.680]   but also some moving toward action items.
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:49.000]   And I love these top three that you provided us,
[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.080]   the pull forward, the multiscale planning,
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:53.020]   and the shutdown ritual,
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:55.920]   and all the others that you've put forth.
[02:52:55.920 --> 02:53:00.360]   And I guess the major takeaway for me today
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:04.040]   is that, yes, you've developed all these tools,
[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:06.600]   but you also use them, and it's not lost on me
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:08.220]   that you also have a flourishing career
[02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:09.840]   as a computer scientist.
[02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:11.920]   So you're not just somebody who talks about,
[02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:13.320]   and here I'm not dissing anyone else
[02:53:13.320 --> 02:53:14.960]   in the information sphere,
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:17.920]   like just talks about habits or just talks about protocols.
[02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:20.400]   You do these things and you implement them
[02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:22.820]   in the context of your work life, your creative life,
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:24.840]   your family life, and your relationship to self,
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:25.800]   and you exercise.
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:29.000]   And I think that that all combines
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:32.600]   to be an amazing example of what's possible
[02:53:32.600 --> 02:53:36.220]   if we introduce a bit of understanding
[02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:39.000]   about how we function as a being,
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:43.040]   and that we implement some of these tools
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:45.320]   in the user manual that you've come up with.
[02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:47.580]   And so I just want to say on behalf of myself
[02:53:47.580 --> 02:53:49.800]   and everyone who's listening and watching,
[02:53:49.800 --> 02:53:50.680]   thank you so much.
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:52.760]   This is incredibly valuable information,
[02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:54.960]   regardless of what one is doing in life.
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:59.800]   And I'm certainly going to implement this three-step system.
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:01.160]   And I do have the book.
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:02.840]   I always like to read books after guests are on.
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:04.720]   I'm going to read the book,
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:07.040]   and I'm going to do some posts
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:10.440]   about what I experience as a consequence.
[02:54:10.440 --> 02:54:13.120]   So thank you so much.
[02:54:13.120 --> 02:54:15.420]   I would pay a substantial amount of money
[02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:18.320]   to do deep work sessions with you on the screen there,
[02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:19.200]   but I won't put that on you.
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:22.960]   I'm going to just bite down and do this stuff.
[02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:26.280]   So thank you so much for being a pioneer in this space
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:28.280]   and for such a clear communicator.
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:29.940]   We all owe you a debt of gratitude.
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:30.780]   - Oh, thanks, Andrew.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:32.360]   - And for the rest of us professors
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:33.760]   who are also podcasting,
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:35.040]   we owe you a debt of gratitude
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:38.200]   because you're showing us what's actually possible.
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:39.240]   So this has been great.
[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:41.040]   Meeting you as well has been fantastic.
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:41.880]   - All right, well, thank you.
[02:54:41.880 --> 02:54:44.280]   We won't see each other on social media,
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.400]   but we'll share a meal at some point before long.
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:49.640]   Thank you for joining me for today's discussion

[02:55:23.960 --> 02:55:25.500]   for the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:27.600]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:29.360]   I do read all the comments.
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:31.840]   Not during today's episode, but on many previous episodes
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:34.480]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:36.560]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:38.560]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:40.920]   for things like improving sleep, improving focus,
[02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:42.280]   and for hormone support.
[02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:43.800]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:49.380]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S, .com/huberman.
[02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:52.140]   That's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:54.080]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:56.880]   I am @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:00.720]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.960]   And at all of those places,
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:04.240]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:05.720]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:07.120]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:09.520]   but much of which is often distinct from the content
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:10.960]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.120]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:15.320]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:56:15.320 --> 02:56:17.000]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.320]   our Neural Network newsletter is a monthly newsletter
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:21.160]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:23.200]   as well as protocols in the form of brief
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:27.000]   one- to three-page PDFs where we spell out specific items
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.360]   for, say, neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:32.360]   or deliberate cold exposure, or fitness,
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.980]   or managing and optimizing dopamine,
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:37.120]   all of which are available completely zero cost.
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:39.880]   You simply go to hubermanlab.com, go to the Menu tab,
[02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:42.800]   scroll down to Newsletter, and supply your email.
[02:56:42.800 --> 02:56:44.360]   I should point out that we do not share
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:46.280]   your email with anybody.
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:47.560]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:50.160]   for today's discussion with Dr. Cal Newport.
[02:56:50.160 --> 02:56:52.320]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:54.220]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:56:54.220 --> 02:56:56.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:56:56.800 --> 02:56:58.860]   you
