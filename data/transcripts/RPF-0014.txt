[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:35.360]   Radical Personal Finance, Episode 14.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:54.080]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.860]   Today is July 7, 2014.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.740]   I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.420]   And on today's show, the question that we will be dealing with is,
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.500]   with the market at an all-time high, should I wait for the market to go down to invest in stocks?
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.820]   Stay with us.
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:26.280]   Today we deal with one of my favorite questions,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.820]   which is exactly what I'm going to be talking about today.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.840]   Today we deal with one of my favorite questions,
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.900]   which is exactly what I'm going to be talking about today.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.440]   Should I wait for the market to go down to invest in stocks?
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.160]   And with today being July 7, 2014,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.840]   let's see, as I read this right now, I'm recording at 2.09 p.m. today,
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to Google Finance,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.700]   is at 17,023 points.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.420]   And in case you didn't pay any attention to investment news over the weekend,
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.500]   closed at an all-time record high on Thursday,
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.820]   last Thursday.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.440]   Before the 4th of July holiday, at 17,000 points.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.780]   And so anytime you read, and the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ also are doing and have done very well.
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.240]   But the Dow is what captured all the news over the weekend.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.300]   So anytime that we are dealing with market high points,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.820]   we get to deal with the questions of,
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.800]   what should I do with my money because of the market high?
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.620]   And today, I'm going to set you free.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.640]   My goal of today's show is to set you free from most of the market commentary
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.800]   and to set you free from the market commentary.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.860]   I'm going to talk about when it matters and when it doesn't matter,
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.240]   and how you can figure out what applies to you.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.420]   So stick with us for that show.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.760]   Before we begin, a couple of quick announcements and updates on the show.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.800]   First of all, thank you for listening.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.380]   I am starting to see several of you listen more and more,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.940]   and I really appreciate it.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.380]   I want you to know that I appreciate each of you who is listening.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.940]   It means the world to me.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.100]   I love to teach.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.620]   I love to teach this stuff.
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.880]   I love to talk about this stuff.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.780]   And I just really appreciate every single one of you.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.800]   one of you who takes time out of your day to spend time with me.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.760]   I know that I can go on for a long period of time sometimes,
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.360]   and I know that if you're listening to all of the shows
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.740]   or for the full length of the shows,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.200]   that you are investing a substantial amount of your time.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.460]   And my hope is that this investment will pay off for you
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.400]   in untold multiples, in spades as the saying goes.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.600]   I hope that you receive untold multiples of your investment of time here with me.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.300]   And I hope that day by day,
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.320]   as I start to learn how to do this a little bit better,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.820]   I hope that day by day I can bring you quality information
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.240]   that's really going to make a substantial difference in your life.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.760]   This week is going to be our first full week of doing the show.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.000]   So last week we launched on Tuesday.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   We did three shows, one on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.780]   I was planning to record a Friday show and sat down to do it,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.380]   and actually it was about 20 minutes in, and it just fell flat.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.640]   And I didn't feel it was good, so I hit delete,
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.980]   stopped the recording.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.760]   I hit delete and went off with my family
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.060]   and enjoyed the Fourth of July holiday weekend,
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.660]   and I hope that you did as well.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.140]   But today being Monday, we're going to release this show.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.560]   I would like to get on kind of a flow of weekly shows.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.260]   I don't want to box myself into a specific schedule
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.700]   of this is what it's always going to be,
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.600]   but in my mind I'd like to do a couple of interview shows per week.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.780]   I'd like to do some current events commentary.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.240]   I'd like to do some teaching on some financial planning topics,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.360]   and I'd like to answer your questions and listen to your feedback
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.680]   and just talk about it.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.760]   So I'm going to do that.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.860]   I'm going to do some teaching on some financial planning topics,
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.640]   and I'm going to talk through the issues with you.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.300]   I really want to engage you, the audience, in the show.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.820]   Still working on getting the technology worked on to do the interviews.
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.300]   I could do an interview, obviously.
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.680]   I've done some in the past,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.900]   but the problem is I'm trying to get a little bit better audio,
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.300]   and I'm having some computer issues that I'm working on
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   to get my better microphone and the recorder working with Skype.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.900]   So I've ordered a piece of gear that should be here,
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.940]   and I'm hoping this will help me.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.640]   I've reached out to a couple people to try to help me with...
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   I'm not such a tech guy, but I'm not such a tech guy.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.120]   I'm not such a techie.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.640]   So I'm trying to get that fixed,
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.680]   and as soon as we get that fixed,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.340]   I've got a lot of people that I would like to bring you some exposure to.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.760]   Some of them I've spoken to.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.640]   Some of them I need to reach out to them as well.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.800]   But I'll bring you some technology...
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.720]   Excuse me, some interview shows just as quickly as possible.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.860]   In the meantime, on Friday, I'm hoping to do a listener question show,
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.820]   and so please go ahead and send me a question.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.980]   In the future, I'd like to get a voicemail feedback line set up
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.580]   to be able to send in those,
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.460]   but I haven't quite got that taken care of yet.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.260]   So in the meantime,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.240]   send me an email if you've got a question or something
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.960]   that you've been dying to ask a financial planner
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.120]   at joshua at radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.860]   and I will incorporate those into the show.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.120]   I'm sure I will go out,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   and in order to supplement,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.480]   since we're still kind of going through the process
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.080]   of getting the word out there,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.320]   I'll go out and try to deal with maybe some FAQs,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.400]   some frequently asked questions
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.200]   that I've often heard over time,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.160]   and maybe I'll go through
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.640]   and look at a couple of my favorite forums,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.680]   internet forums,
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.000]   if I can find some questions that people are asking.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.780]   But I thank you just for being here at the beginning.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.240]   Still working on getting relisted,
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.420]   getting listed in iTunes and whatnot.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.820]   I had submitted a feed previously,
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.540]   and so you may get that feed coming in,
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.080]   but then when I took the show down,
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.620]   I had to delete that feed
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.500]   and tried to get the new feed in iTunes,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.400]   and I've been working on that over the weekend.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.600]   So I hope to be back relisted in iTunes.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.320]   If you have a problem with the feed,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.080]   if the shows disappear,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.840]   please go in, check in iTunes,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.980]   or whatever podcast directory that you're listening to,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.720]   and resubscribe.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.040]   I'm adjusting, again, I'm adjusting a couple of feeds,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.120]   so should be there in a day or two.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.000]   Love it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.760]   Love it if you tell someone about the show.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.040]   Probably best to wait until we're listed in iTunes,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.340]   but would love it if you would tell somebody about the show.
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.640]   And then also, as soon as we're listed in iTunes,
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.280]   I would appreciate any reviews.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.720]   Good, positive, great.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.420]   Tell me, Joshua, you're doing a great job.
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.980]   That's awesome.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.760]   Tell me, Joshua, you're doing a horrible job.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:50.320]   Love that.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   And tell me, Joshua, you're doing a mediocre job.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.080]   That's fine as well.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.780]   I will read all of those
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.360]   and appreciate each and every one of them.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.080]   There will be a link in the show notes,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.740]   which, by the way, I noticed that iTunes
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.580]   has just made a change with their,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.140]   I use the Apple podcast catcher,
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.060]   the one that's just native for the iOS devices,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.400]   and they've made a change
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.520]   where now they're allowing hyperlinks.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.760]   So if you'll check the show notes,
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.820]   which the way you do that is
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.320]   if you're listening on an iOS device,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.860]   just click the, press the logo,
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.140]   and it'll pop to the show notes.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.340]   And at the bottom of these show notes,
[00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.740]   there will be a link to leave an iTunes review,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.800]   and would love it if you'd leave a review.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.160]   That would be great and hugely appreciated.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.980]   You know, certainly finding,
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.640]   still working to find my voice.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.900]   I'm pretty challenged with the daily amount
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.580]   of what needs to be done for the show
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.000]   and then also for all the other projects
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.500]   that I have going on in addition to the show.
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.840]   But I'm here for the long term.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.820]   I'm committed to this.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.080]   I told my wife, I said,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.220]   I'm going to do a thousand episodes.
[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.920]   So if I can't,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.240]   if I can't, I'm going to do it for a thousand episodes.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.660]   And if five or 10 people listen,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.300]   that'd be great.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.720]   I'll work to it.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.800]   I'll feel really good about sharing the content
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   with five or 10 people.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.460]   I'm hoping that a few more than that
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.440]   will tune in over time.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.160]   But I certainly am still just working to find my voice.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.700]   And, you know, I was listening to one of the shows
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.760]   from last week and was a little disgusted
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   with the number of ums and ahs.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400]   So I'm working today to do a better job with that.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.480]   Some days I, it's so easy to feel like,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.320]   well, there are other people
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.020]   that are better qualified for this than me.
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.880]   There's other people that do a better job with it,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.540]   but I just don't see anybody doing it.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.660]   And the way that I think it should be done,
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.180]   and just giving good information,
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.280]   talking through things,
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.460]   exploring the nuance to help people be educated.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.580]   I just don't see anybody doing it.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.700]   And so I'm going to do it.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.840]   And I thank you for staying with me along the ride.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.920]   So let's jump in.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.140]   Dow hit 17,000 points, closed at 17,000 points.
[00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.480]   It previously hit 17,000,
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.700]   but the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.200]   closed at over 17,000 points on Thursday,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.140]   right before the holiday.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.200]   And anytime you have a new market high,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.340]   this was a new market high
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.860]   coming up from the previous market high.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.680]   I think it was 16,000 hit a few times.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.540]   I don't pay much attention to it on a daily,
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.560]   or even on a weekly or monthly basis.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.560]   But I think it hit 16,000,
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.880]   which was another record previously.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.540]   So closed at 17,000.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.940]   And here are the four article titles
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.380]   that you can always predict
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.540]   when general stock markets hit a new record high.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.100]   Number one article is stocks have more room to run.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.520]   The bulls are continuing.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.320]   And the number two is stocks are going to go down.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.200]   There's a bubble.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.660]   And the bears are going to...
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.120]   The bears are going to win.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.440]   The bulls are stupid.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.320]   Number three is here's why you should still invest,
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.480]   even though stocks are high.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.160]   And the number four is here's why you should not invest
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.020]   when stocks are high.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.860]   And these are the four articles
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.500]   that you're constantly going to read.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.900]   So this morning, just for fun,
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.060]   I popped over to Google News,
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.540]   and I plugged in stocks,
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.340]   and I plugged in a couple of words
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.100]   that would make these articles pull up for me.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.640]   And here are the articles,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.100]   each of them written as predictably so.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.640]   Here are all...
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.120]   All of the articles.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.260]   So the first one,
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.400]   stocks have room to run.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.180]   Today, excuse me,
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.180]   updated July 4,
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.820]   Wall Street Journal headline.
[00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.820]   Stocks are picking up speed.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.400]   Byline, or excuse me,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.620]   the, I don't know what this is called,
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.560]   sub headline.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.200]   Dow topped 17,000 for the first time,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.880]   and many investors bet the five-year bull market
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.440]   has more room to run.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.700]   And you go down and you read through here,
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.420]   and you see, well, the market's going to run.
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.940]   Next one here is a CNBC article.
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.620]   And so,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.560]   here would be,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.300]   this one is from July 3, Thursday.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.380]   So this was actually right before the 17,000.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.500]   And this one is titled,
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.520]   Why U.S. Stocks Aren't Overvalued Yet,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.200]   written by Leslie Schaefer for CNBC.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.560]   And, again, normal article.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.700]   I feel bad for the news organizations
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.700]   that have to constantly produce article after article,
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.640]   which eventually just really doesn't seem like it says much over time.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.020]   So there's your positive news.
[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.060]   Stocks aren't overvalued.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.600]   Stocks are going to be overvalued.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.020]   Stocks are going to run.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.040]   And now let's go and look at the bears.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.360]   So my favorite gloom and doom website is Zero Hedge.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.620]   You can always count on reading some good gloomy forecasts over there.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.460]   So go over to ZeroHedge.com,
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.920]   and I just flipped through the first couple of pages here,
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.060]   just from over the weekend,
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.080]   all the articles that they posted over the weekend.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.520]   And this one is from July 7.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.700]   Stocks tumble.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.860]   Give up all the, quote, unquote, great jobs report gains.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.040]   Here, nothing's cheap anymore, is the article.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.040]   Day after, and here's the, it's a one-paragraph article.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.540]   This is good.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.640]   Day after day, we are bombasted with asset gatherers,
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.180]   academics, and status quo huggers demanding we BTFATH.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.160]   I'm not sure what that, I got to look up that acronym.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.420]   I don't know what that acronym is.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.500]   Demanding we BTFATH as, quote, stocks are still cheap.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.560]   Some have even deferred modestly to the old standby.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.320]   Quote, stocks are fairly valued.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.200]   In a last lame effort to save,
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.580]   what credibility they have left when they look themselves in the mirror.
[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.740]   The fact is, no, stocks are not cheap.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.000]   As we pointed out here,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.920]   they are more expensive than at the peak of what Jim Bullard called an obvious bubble.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.060]   Links to a separate article.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.040]   However, still, the shrill call of stock picker's market
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.900]   rings out to encourage the placement of hard-earned savings
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.880]   into easily commissioned AUM,
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.600]   which stands for assets under management.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.380]   The fact is, as the three charts below show,
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.440]   nothing is cheap.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.080]   Nothing.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.740]   There have never been so few, almost zero stocks,
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.120]   that are, quote, cheap based on historical valuations.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.420]   Another one here, the one that the article linked to,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.520]   stocks are officially more overvalued than during the last bubble peak.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.060]   And here's another one of my favorites.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.800]   It would load.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.060]   Basically, the headline of this one is that
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.480]   current wealth is transitory
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.520]   and the risks of failing to act should not be overlooked.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.300]   It should not be underestimated.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.520]   So here are your pessimistic articles,
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.920]   all lined up for you.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.840]   And then you can go on and you can search out the other articles
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.720]   of what should you do about it.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.500]   So Wall Street Journal article,
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.540]   with stocks so high,
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.440]   should investors move to cash?
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.280]   Discussing that.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.340]   And you can find these.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.740]   Look for these over the next week or two.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.800]   They're going to be everywhere.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.020]   And this is just the ongoing trend
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.500]   of the investment market.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.420]   Investment news that you read every single day,
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.340]   if you read it.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.280]   So what on earth do you do about this stuff?
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.240]   Today, my goal is to set you free
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.280]   from the fear and worry of market highs
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.720]   and the fear and worry of the financial news,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.620]   these kinds of articles.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.760]   And the key to being free
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.780]   is personal education and understanding.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.980]   Generally, people fear what they don't understand
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.680]   and what they're not confident in.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.140]   But if you are well educated,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.720]   and you're confident in the topic,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.820]   and you're confident in what you're doing,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.060]   you generally don't fear something.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.500]   Imagine if you're a standard U.S. American person,
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.920]   you constantly spend a lot of time in the car,
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.420]   you drive every day,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.120]   and you have no problem of driving down the interstate
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.340]   at 75 miles an hour.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.540]   You have no problem with that.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.200]   But imagine if you came from
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.960]   the proverbial jungles of wherever,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.380]   and you'd never seen a car,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.780]   and someone plopped you into a car
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.800]   at 75 miles an hour cruising down the interstate.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.960]   That would be an extremely,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.200]   extremely fearful scenario, right?
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   I remember you read news articles
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.800]   about how people thought in the past
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.300]   when railroads were first being built up,
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.740]   how people thought that
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.700]   if you went over 35 miles an hour,
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.040]   that the human body couldn't handle
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.660]   going over 35 miles an hour.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.360]   And now we say,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.160]   well, there may be a limit somewhere,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.940]   but we can certainly handle going
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.740]   hundreds and hundreds of miles per hour.
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.840]   And we seem to do well
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.500]   under that.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.380]   So the first thing, in my opinion,
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.340]   to remember is that the news thrives
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.940]   on attention.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.560]   If a news article cannot draw your attention,
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.300]   it doesn't work.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.640]   News is news precisely because it's abnormal.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.320]   If all the news did,
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.900]   if I were writing financial news articles,
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.760]   I would come every single day,
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.260]   the article would read something like this.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.280]   Today, stock market prices
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:22.620]   wandered around the world,
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:49.940]   and nobody really knows
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.980]   because there are millions and millions of people,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.500]   no one really, really knows why,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.560]   because there are millions and millions of people
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.200]   involved in the market every day.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.860]   And each one of them has their own individual goals,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.200]   their own individual strategy,
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.700]   their own individual purposes.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.380]   And there are so many,
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.480]   when you start looking at things,
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.080]   there are so many different things
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.500]   that can move prices,
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.920]   you start to just become numb to the whole thing.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.040]   Now, I do want to be careful with what I'm saying.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.260]   It does seem that certainly
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.240]   you can see impacts of major events,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.100]   on markets.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.760]   I wouldn't go so far as to say you can't see that.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.740]   But remember, for every buyer, there's a seller.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.480]   And that's one of the big ones.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.340]   We'll come to that in a moment.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.060]   But that's one of the big ones that people forget.
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.180]   For every seller, there's a buyer.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.780]   So there's a counterparty in every single transaction.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.000]   News, fear and greed sell.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.560]   Fear and greed both are some of the most effective ways to sell.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.840]   But fear actually sells more.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.280]   People always do more to keep from losing,
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.740]   especially money, than they will to gain.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.560]   And so anytime you can sell to fear,
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.800]   it's one of the most effective tactics.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.580]   And so that's why you see people get this fearful frenzy
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.480]   and do stupid things.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.920]   And this can be manipulated.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.780]   And this is especially true in markets.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.000]   And it's especially true
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.160]   when people don't truly understand markets.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.540]   I should probably begin any discussion with markets,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.720]   any discussion on markets,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.280]   with the caveat that I don't have a market outlook.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.140]   Well, actually, that's not quite true.
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.220]   I don't have any kind of short-term market outlook ever.
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.380]   And I am not a brilliant investment manager.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.760]   And I personally think it matters very little.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.540]   It matters very little what happens in the short term
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.700]   of any kind of market outlook.
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.440]   I do think that I do have a long-term market outlook.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.900]   And I'm actually an eternal bull.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.180]   And I'll explain why.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.040]   I believe that over time,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.640]   well-run financial markets will always,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.340]   well-run companies will always increase in value.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.480]   And the reason is that over time,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.260]   people always improve their situation in the long term.
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.720]   There has never been a period of history
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.260]   at which it's been better to be alive than today.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.920]   Period.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.240]   There's never been a period of history
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.500]   at which we've had more advantages to us than today.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.840]   And people will always work
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.520]   to improve the things in their lives,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.420]   the things that they don't like.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.740]   Now, that improvement is usually uneven.
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.680]   There may be up, up, up, down, down, up, up, down, up, up, up, up, down, down.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.280]   But generally, the long-term trend is up.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.820]   And the way that people do that is they work together.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.800]   And in our system, we have a capitalistic-based system
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.260]   which rewards those who do better and improve the world
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.540]   with things called profits.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.700]   Profits measured in the form of money.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.980]   The people that work together, they form companies.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.000]   And as those people work together to meet the needs of the market,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.280]   they make a profit.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.640]   And as they make a profit,
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.520]   they give that profit to their stockholders.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.160]   And if the company is unprofitable,
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.380]   it'll close its doors and it will be replaced
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.180]   by somebody who's able to do it better,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.360]   more efficiently,
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.400]   and to provide a better service.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.220]   And that's always the way history has always been.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.100]   And I've never found any rational reason to believe
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.640]   that it wouldn't always be like that in the future.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.280]   Any history of the world,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.840]   that I've ever been able to read through,
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:27.460]   illustrates that people always improve their situations over time.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.580]   And companies and owners of companies accrue wealth.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:35.320]   Now, there can be lots of hiccups.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   There may be a war.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.280]   There may be a financial crash.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.400]   There may be major economic problems.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.120]   There always are.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.780]   But even those times are tremendous opportunities for people.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.260]   And so the key is to be able to identify those things
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.360]   when possible and take steps that are going to position,
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.000]   you know, I want to take steps that are going to position me
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.440]   to profit in the good times and in the bad times.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.200]   And I believe that's done through sound financial planning.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.140]   And I'll explain more a little bit about that
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.000]   within the context of this conversation in a few minutes.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.640]   So with all of these articles,
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.260]   the problem is that all the fear articles
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.200]   are basically irrelevant to 85% of the general U.S. population.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.240]   They're only relevant to less than 50% of the U.S. population.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.700]   So you say, why that number?
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.260]   Well, it's because 85% of the general U.S. population doesn't own stocks.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.840]   Now, you might be wondering how that's true
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.000]   because most people seem to own something,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.880]   whether it's through the context of a corporate pension plan,
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.940]   such as a 401k or their IRA or a health savings account
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.120]   or something like that.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.200]   But here's why.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.640]   85% of the public doesn't own stocks
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.160]   because 85% of the public doesn't invest in individual stocks.
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.940]   Only 15% of the public.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.280]   Only 15% of the public does invest in individual stocks.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.640]   And I'm citing for that Federal Reserve data.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.460]   Feel free to check me out and fact-check me
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.120]   and make sure that I'm correct.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.060]   So the market news is completely irrelevant to the 85%.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.920]   And it's actually irrelevant to most of the other 15%.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.560]   Because of the 15% who do own stocks,
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.100]   of those numbers, 20% of them own one company.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.820]   So that's 8% of households.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:19.620]   And 17.8% of those 15%
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.920]   are the U.S. population.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.640]   And 53% of those 15%
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.040]   own between 2 to 9 companies.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.760]   And so there's only a total of 3%
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.420]   in total of the U.S. population
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.680]   that owns greater than 10 individual stocks,
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.440]   10 individual companies.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.560]   And when you look at that data,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.640]   you say, well, why would the Dow Jones Industrial Average
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.980]   at all-time high affect someone?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.040]   That's 30 stocks.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.900]   Why would that affect somebody that owns 2 to 9 firms?
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.140]   It doesn't, really.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.800]   In one sense, it does.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.760]   Of course it does, because you have a general trend.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.520]   Yeah, I'm aware of that.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.080]   But it doesn't affect their holdings.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.440]   So this really affects about 3% of the U.S. population.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.660]   And yet, you would think when you read an article
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.260]   or you see it on the front page of the news
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.880]   or it leads the evening TV news,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.800]   you would think this affects everybody.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.440]   It doesn't.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.680]   Now, what about the people that invest through other things
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.400]   except through other vehicles,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.200]   more than just individual stocks?
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:20.880]   Well, that's valid.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.560]   And that would be about 50% of American families
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.920]   do own some kind of stock through a fund.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.360]   Through some kind of fund.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.760]   And that's going to be a major part
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.960]   of what we're going to talk about today.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.300]   So I've come up with basically what I think
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.780]   are three ways to be three steps,
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.200]   three steps to set yourself free
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.080]   from the tyranny of the financial news.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.740]   To understand, number one,
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.520]   the vast majority of people don't own stocks.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.740]   They own other financial instruments,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.140]   which have stocks, but they don't own stocks.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.000]   And even the, it's only 50% of the people that do own,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.700]   that don't own any kind of financial instrument
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.520]   containing stocks.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.940]   So number one, understand,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.240]   most people don't own stocks,
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.300]   and that probably includes you.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.240]   Number two is then you have to understand your strategy.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.260]   Understand the strategy of the people that you've hired
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.360]   to run those investment vehicles,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.260]   whatever they are,
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.780]   and understand how that strategy
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.560]   might be affected by market movements.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.860]   And then number three,
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.480]   you always need to make all decisions
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:20.840]   within the framework of your strategy.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.260]   And that should take into account
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.500]   your personal goals and your personal fears,
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.600]   your personal comfort level with investments,
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.860]   your personal comfort level with volatility,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.580]   with the ups and downs of market movements.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.780]   And remember this,
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.640]   the stock market is not the only place to invest money.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.720]   There's no reason why you can't open up a gas station
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.640]   or a string of gas stations in your own hometown.
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.800]   So maybe that's what you should be spending your money doing,
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.820]   or open up a gas station
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.680]   or open up a McDonald's franchise
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.860]   or a Dunkin' Donuts
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.900]   or start an internet company
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.240]   or build a welding company
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.500]   or start a house cleaning company
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.540]   or a construction company
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.540]   or a products and services company
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.840]   or a retailer.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.800]   There are any number of things that can be invested in.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.200]   Every single one of those things
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.980]   is just as valid as investing in stocks.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.540]   However, publicly traded stocks
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.680]   do have their own advantages,
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.160]   and we'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   There's no such thing as a stock market
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.940]   in this way.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.660]   The stock market is not, you know,
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.040]   something or someone.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   It's not an entity.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.940]   It's not this entity that has a mind of its own.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.360]   The stock market is just where people come together
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.460]   to buy and sell shares of their companies.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.900]   And so they come together to trade little bits of paper,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.660]   not paper anymore, little digits,
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.260]   that represent ownership in various companies,
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.540]   some large, some small, some local,
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.100]   some national, some international.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.780]   And these are all traded together,
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:50.940]   and they're all traded together
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.580]   in a place we call the stock market.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.920]   And so what the price of a stock represents
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.360]   is just literally the last price
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.500]   at which a trade happened between two parties.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:03.980]   So if the stock is priced at $20 per share,
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.980]   all that information tells us
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.340]   is that the most recent trade happened at $20 per share,
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.220]   or that somebody is really ready
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.240]   to offer $20 a share for this price.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.200]   And so if you don't like that price,
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.940]   don't take it.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.120]   If you like the price, take it.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.760]   And that's why we're talking about
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.560]   all trading is done based upon.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.520]   It's done based upon whether one person
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.020]   values something more than they value the money,
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.540]   and the other person values the money
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.400]   more than they value the good.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.320]   And we never know why people decide to trade.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.420]   In all transactions, all financial transactions,
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.080]   each party is ultimately going to believe
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.360]   that they benefit more.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.040]   So let's say that I go,
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.560]   and I'm looking to buy a pair of jeans.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.280]   And I go down to the store,
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.380]   and the store has a pair of jeans,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.660]   and they are offering the pair of jeans for sale.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.840]   Well, if I want to buy the jeans,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.900]   I have to value the jeans more than I value the money
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.060]   that I trade for the jeans.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.520]   So let's say it's a $50 pair of jeans.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.560]   I have to believe that by giving them my $50,
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.780]   I'm going to win.
[00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.960]   And they believe that by giving me their jeans
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   and them getting the $50, they win.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.300]   That's it.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.180]   Every transaction is based upon that.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.180]   So it's exactly the same in the world of stock market.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   So what we're saying is that
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.460]   one person values the company more than they value the money,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.580]   and one person values the money more than they value the company.
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.720]   And so we never know why people decide to trade.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.440]   Some may be obvious.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.600]   There may be a large investor who comes on TV and says,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.560]   here's why I'm trading this block of shares,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.640]   and here's why I'm willing to sell them and accept the money.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.420]   And then someone else may come on and say the opposite.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.800]   Here's why I'm buying this large block of trades,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.700]   large block of shares.
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   And in today's world, with so much of the money institutionalized,
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.960]   where there's large companies and large institutions doing the transactions,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.520]   then it becomes very challenging for these companies
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.960]   to make their trades anonymously.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.200]   So oftentimes you do know.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.760]   You do understand what a company's outlook is,
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   and you do understand why people are buying and trading it.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   But it could be from everything from the latest earnings report,
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.680]   hurt expectations, or was below expectations,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.260]   to the fact that maybe a father needed to pay for his daughter's wedding,
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.660]   and therefore he valued,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:24.960]   the $50,000 that he could get for his General Electric stock,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.780]   more than he valued owning the General Electric stock,
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.820]   because he wanted to pay for the wedding.
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.300]   Who knows?
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.500]   There are millions and millions of reasons
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.100]   why people own stocks and trade stocks.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.020]   So remember that the majority of people don't own stocks.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:41.880]   Let's assume you do.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.040]   Well, let's talk about your strategy.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.900]   And anytime you're going to be owning a stock,
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.380]   you should have some rationale for it.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.380]   You should have some strategy.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.960]   So you're probably doing some kind of analysis on the stock.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.580]   So there are basically three major types of stock analysis,
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.200]   and there's always exceptions to everything.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.720]   How's that for a blanket statement?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.740]   There's exceptions to that.
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.560]   There's just about always exceptions to everything in the financial world.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.480]   But in general, there's usually three different categories of stock research.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.780]   One would be fundamental analysis.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.380]   Number two would be quantitative analysis.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.940]   And number three would be technical analysis.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:20.360]   So fundamental analysis is usually,
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.700]   where you're looking at an individual company
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.720]   and you're giving a rating to that company
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.520]   based upon its individual business prospects.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.320]   So if you were analyzing a company on the fundamentals,
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.240]   you might look through its operations.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   You might take a look at its balance sheet,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.820]   at its finances.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.900]   You might try to figure out what its future earnings would be.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.380]   And so you'd read through their filings with the SEC.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.560]   You'd read through any trade journals that talked about it.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.340]   You'd read any industry interviews.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.720]   You'd read any industry reviews with the management
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.880]   or kind of take a look through any kind of competitive reports
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.120]   that you could get access to.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.020]   Maybe you would go to the company.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.640]   Maybe you would visit its stores.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.780]   So let's say that you wanted to invest in Chipotle,
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.200]   but you didn't understand why everyone was crazy about it.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.320]   Well, you'd go to a Chipotle and see what the experience was.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.460]   Maybe talk to a few people.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.100]   That's all fundamental analysis.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.100]   Now, in quantitative analysis,
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.220]   usually with quantitative analysis,
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.980]   you're taking a look and you're making a hypothesis.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.320]   And so this hypothesis would be based on
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.560]   something that you've observed and you're trying to test it.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.780]   So maybe you said that
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.400]   female CEOs of companies do better than male CEOs.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.460]   And so you're going to go back
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.620]   and you're going to try to test your hypothesis and see that.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.880]   Well, quantitative analysis,
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.500]   you're basically largely looking for,
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.980]   you're looking through a lot of data
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.740]   and you're trying to say,
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.040]   is this factor and this idea that I've picked up on
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.740]   going to, is this factor going to make a difference
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.300]   across a large variety of companies?
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.420]   And you're looking to test this out.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.160]   The third area is technical analysis.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.340]   So with technical,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.700]   if you're doing technical analysis on a stock,
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.440]   then a technical analyst would basically say,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.480]   you know, a stock price follows a certain pattern.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.340]   And this pattern is largely based upon
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.240]   the irrational behavior of investors.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.600]   So it's not so much about
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.180]   what the underlying company is doing,
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.960]   and it's more about what investors are actually believing about
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.660]   companies.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.560]   So everyone jumps on,
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.680]   and then when it reaches a certain price point,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.720]   then it jumps off.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.840]   So a technical investor would call that a resistance level.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.440]   And they'd say, oh, this stock is reaching a resistance level.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.460]   At $20 per share,
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.540]   it looks like there's more sellers than buyers,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.440]   and people aren't quite ready for this higher level.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.100]   Or they might look and they say,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.500]   well, at $15 a share,
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.260]   it seems to be kind of a support level.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.380]   And so people, if it goes below $15,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.900]   generally investors are willing to pay more.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.860]   But this is all based,
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.100]   not upon any underlying assumption about the company.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.280]   It's more based upon people's perception of the company.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.340]   So if you were trading your portfolio,
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.740]   you would do it based upon that.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.920]   And you would understand that
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.220]   none of these strategies involve what the Dow is doing,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.400]   what the general market is doing.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.820]   And each of them is specific either to an individual company
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.940]   or to a company in relation to the market
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.180]   or in relation to investor sentiment.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.700]   So the only way that the Dow closing at 17,000 points matters,
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.460]   in this scenario,
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.560]   is if that is one of your,
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.940]   I don't know, maybe that's your support level
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.780]   or your resistance level for your technical trade.
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:34.780]   Now, maybe you are approaching it with the idea of,
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.580]   let's say you're a value investor.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.940]   So you go through and you perform fundamental analysis on stocks
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.980]   and you say, well, based upon my fundamental analysis,
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.100]   I believe the intrinsic value of this company is $15 a share.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.820]   Well, Dow 17,000 doesn't mean
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.400]   anything to you.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.540]   You're looking at your company.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.400]   Or maybe you're a technical investor
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.140]   and you're just, again, trading based upon those resistance levels
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.040]   and support levels.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.600]   If maybe you're swing trading or day trading,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.440]   well, in this situation,
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.880]   you're going to be just trading based upon movement
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.080]   and each and every day just moving based upon movement.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.360]   It's really irrelevant which direction the movement is to you.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.760]   And 17,000 is not that big a deal
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.680]   except maybe you say, well, we hit that
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.340]   and we're going to bounce back a little bit.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.880]   That seems to be what's happened so far today.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.180]   You got to understand your strategy.
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.900]   Now, those ideas were applicable
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.100]   to basically this tiny percentage of the U.S. general market.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.640]   Most people own funds, not stocks.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:34.620]   They own funds of stocks, not stocks directly.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.860]   Well, in a fund of stock,
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.060]   it's even more important to understand what the strategy is.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.840]   What is your portfolio built to do?
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.280]   So in your portfolio,
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.200]   you need to understand what investments
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.760]   are making up that portfolio.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.620]   So let's say that you're a passive index,
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.340]   fund investor.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.980]   Well, if you're a passive index fund investor,
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.940]   you need to understand the idea
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.800]   behind the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.100]   And so the efficient market hypothesis
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.880]   basically would claim that the current stock price
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.440]   incorporates all known information about a company.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.020]   Incidentally, you may find interesting,
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.800]   there's actually three forms
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.000]   of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.560]   So whenever you're reading something
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.420]   about the efficient market hypothesis,
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   it's a good idea to try to understand
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.920]   what the efficient market hypothesis
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.280]   you are hearing about.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.980]   And so the three versions would be
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.380]   what they call the weak form hypothesis,
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.380]   the semi-strong form hypothesis,
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.300]   and the strong form hypothesis.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.620]   And the weak form hypothesis
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.560]   would basically say
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.200]   that stock prices already reflect
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.640]   all the information that you could pool
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   by looking at the history of past prices
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.520]   or trends or trading volumes
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.400]   or interest by people shorting the stocker,
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.140]   things like that.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.980]   And so the idea here is that
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.360]   all this past stock data is publicly available.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.120]   So it's useless for you to try to look for a trend
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.560]   or something that's unexploited
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.020]   because all the data is available
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.260]   and it's practically free
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.180]   and so somebody's already exploited it.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.000]   So if you see a good example would be,
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.660]   this would be the dogs of the Dow strategy.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:13.400]   So someone who claimed the weak form hypothesis
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.740]   would say, well, this dogs of the Dow trading strategy,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.320]   which goes and looks at these stocks
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.660]   and the Dow Jones Adjustable Average
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.260]   that don't meet these certain criteria
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.080]   that are the dogs of the Dow not doing well
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.260]   according to this criteria.
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.000]   I don't remember exactly off the top of my head
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.200]   what those criteria were.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.000]   They would say, well, these are good companies to buy.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.700]   Well, a weak form hypothesis,
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.080]   a believer in the weak form hypothesis would say,
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.940]   it's not really any point in doing that
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.080]   because now that anytime someone says dogs of the Dow,
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.700]   that has now been exploited to the point
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.240]   where there's no advantage to be gained in that situation.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.880]   So don't even waste your time.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.220]   Not even worth it.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:53.160]   The semi-strong form hypothesis would say
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:55.940]   that all publicly available information
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.420]   regarding the prospects of a firm
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.140]   must already be reflected in the stock price.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.080]   So that includes anything about past prices
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.920]   or any kind of fundamental information
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.800]   on how much money they're making or on new products
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.920]   or how good the management is
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.460]   or how much money they have
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.880]   and what their forecasts are
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.400]   or what their accounting practices are.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:15.980]   That's all done.
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.120]   All investors have access to the information
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.020]   and it's free and costless to obtain.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:27.120]   So therefore, there's no point in combing through earnings reports,
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:34.560]   trying to figure out whether the company is doing well
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.340]   or is going to do better in the future.
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.400]   There's no point.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   It's already been incorporated into the price of the stock.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.600]   That would be the semi-strong form of the hypothesis.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.180]   And I think most people, when they actually
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:49.020]   mention the efficient market hypothesis, they usually,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.920]   in their mind, envisioning the semi-strong form.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.780]   And then the last form would be the strong form
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.400]   of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.640]   And this would say that stock prices reflect all information
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:05.340]   relevant to the firm, even including information
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.660]   only available to company insiders.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.720]   And so that's a pretty, pun intended,
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.900]   strong form of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.560]   It would say that even if you were the president of the company
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.920]   and the accountant and you knew that you had some challenges,
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.340]   and you were meeting together, that the stock price already
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.820]   incorporates that information.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.140]   So I think that that one's probably
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.620]   the most challenging to defend.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.380]   But then again, you rarely find people that would say that.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:35.480]   But that is the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.700]   We won't go into insider trading.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.380]   We're going to ignore that for now.
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.280]   And again, not saying that this is true.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.720]   This is not true.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.780]   My personal opinion on it is that it's important and very
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.820]   valid.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.440]   And yet, I think there are exceptions.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.100]   But again, I'm not necessarily the guy to pick on that from.
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.920]   It doesn't line up well.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.620]   My beef with it is that it wouldn't incorporate
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.180]   behavioral economics.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.420]   And I think you certainly-- in my opinion,
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.000]   you certainly see times where there
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.040]   are things that are undervalued and overvalued based
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.140]   upon the behavioral herd mentality.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.480]   But that's me.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.800]   And again, don't do anything with that information.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.720]   That's just anything-- that's my opinion.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.140]   I'm not going to go into too much detail on that topic.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.340]   But go back to understand your strategy.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.640]   So assume you're a passive index fund investor.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.820]   Well, necessarily, a passive investing
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:33.240]   is based upon the premise of the efficient market hypothesis.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   And that premise would say that the current stock price,
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.700]   at least the semi-strong version,
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.600]   incorporates all known information about the company.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.620]   Well, in that situation, if you reach
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:48.620]   Dow 17,000 or whatever the S&P 500 is, if you say, well, this
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.120]   is the actual price of the company,
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.000]   assume for a moment that price-- one thought incidentally.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.120]   This is a little bit debated.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.840]   But here's the way I think of price.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.940]   The price is people's expectation
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.980]   of all of the future earnings of a company
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.680]   based upon their acceptable discount rate.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:14.040]   And so if you're going to buy a house from me, a rental house,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   then what you pay for that rental house
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.520]   basically would say, if I have my cost,
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.080]   and I have my income from the house, and I take that income,
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.640]   and I push it forward, and I include the cost of repairs
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.860]   to the house, the expenses, and I include my terminal value
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.040]   of the house-- so whatever I think
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.960]   I could sell the house for based upon my future price,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.740]   and whatever I could sell the house for in the future-- then
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.540]   I take all of those cash flows, and I back them up for today,
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.820]   and I say, what's the total value of all the cash flows
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.420]   I can accept from this property, and then what rate
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.880]   of return do I require from my investments?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.140]   And that's how you would arrive to set the price.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.840]   Well, investors in a company don't and shouldn't necessarily
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.420]   do anything different if they're following a strategy that's not
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.020]   based upon the movement in stock price,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:08.420]   but rather that's based upon the actual company's performance.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.440]   So that's all the price is.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.260]   And so you would say, well, whatever the price is at Dow
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.480]   17,000, that's fine.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.480]   That's the exact price.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.320]   This incorporates all of the--
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.620]   I mean, the actual price is the same as the actual price
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.620]   at Dow 17,000.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.620]   So that's the exact price.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.620]   And so you would say, well, whatever the price is at Dow
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:25.620]   17,000, that's fine.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.620]   But what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.620]   Well, the price is the same as the actual price.
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.620]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.620]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.620]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.620]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.620]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.620]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.620]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.220]   Well, the price is the actual price.
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   So what I would say is, well, what's the price?

[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.420]   But on the other hand, if I surfed over to Warren Buffett,
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.620]   and he said, what, the world is going to fall apart,
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.000]   I would say, whoa, what's going on here?
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.140]   Is that some people just-- you have these underlying biases
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.400]   and these underlying assumptions that influence your philosophy.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.320]   So try to understand what those things are.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.520]   Try to understand what your biases and assumptions are,
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   and then make a plan that's rational within that context.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.420]   So as with all things in financial planning,
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:52.320]   the answer to should I buy stocks or should I invest at Dow 17,000,
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   as with all things, the answer is based upon your situation.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   And the answer is, it depends.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   You got to look at your specific goals, your specific situation,
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   and talk it through and think it through.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   But think it through from a comprehensive standpoint.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   Think it through and look for the areas where you're being irrational,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   and really research and understand your strategies.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   So that's it for today's show.
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   Again, today was Monday, July 17-- excuse me, July 7.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.320]   I hope you enjoyed the show.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.320]   It's challenging to do these kinds of shows.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   And I'll tell you, it's most challenging to be out there on the record.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   It's a scary place to be when you're putting your ideas out there on the record.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.320]   And I'm such a perfectionist that I see all the problems in everything that I say.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   And if I give my caveat to every caveat, then the show would be forever.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   So I've tried to avoid that, but that's a major challenge for me.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.220]   Today's show is episode--
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   14.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.220]   Come by the show.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.220]   It's RadicalPersonalFinance.com/14.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   Love to hear your thoughts and opinions on the show.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.220]   Give me your feedback.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.220]   Point out where I'm wrong.
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.220]   Would love to know that.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.220]   As always, financial planning is intensely personal.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.220]   Please go and talk with your own financial planner.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   And don't take your advice from some random guy on the internet.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.220]   Take the information and then go and take a look at it in your own personal life.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.220]   Hope today's been helpful and would love to hear from you.
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.120]   Have a great Monday, everybody.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   Thanks, everybody.
