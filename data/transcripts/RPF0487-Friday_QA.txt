[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.000]   please stay tuned and listen towards the end of the show and I'll share with you one short-term
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.440]   change that I am going to be making.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.400]   So let's start off with Ken in Ohio.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.680]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, Ken.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680]   How can I serve you today?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   Hey, Josh.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.680]   Thanks for taking my call.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   I don't know if this is going to be too complex or not to go through, but I can't seem to
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.600]   find anybody that I trust more than you to answer this question, if that sounds right.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   Well, let's give it a shot.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   I'll tell you if I know something and I'll tell you if I don't, I promise.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   I'm pretty sure you're going to know the answer to this.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.440]   So my financial advisor, he's advising me to transfer my emergency fund and additional
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.600]   savings I have for my upcoming girls going to college.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.400]   They're going to be going to college in 2021, actually 2020, 2021.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   So I'm kind of planning ahead.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.080]   And he thinks it's better for me to have all my savings, the cash that I have, all the
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.560]   stuff that I get penalized for in the FAFSA, to have it in a whole life account, cash value,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.360]   whole life with paid up additions.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.000]   And his concept is if you create this account, you can overfund the account and then use
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.600]   it kind of like a savings account that you can take and pull away money anytime you need
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   it.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.960]   So if you need to buy your new car because of the money you've saved up, you can just
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   pull the money out of the account.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.040]   It's safer than having a stock or a bond fund.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.080]   It won't go against the FAFSA, so we would possibly be eligible for more funding when
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.800]   the kids get ready to go to college.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.640]   I've got term life insurance, and that makes sense to me.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.120]   This whole thing about cash value with paid up additions, I just can't wrap my head around
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   it and I can't explain it to my 14-year-old.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.260]   So I need somebody else to tell me whether or not this is a snake oil salesman trying
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.680]   to sell me something or if it's something that really would be a good benefit for me
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   going forward.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.640]   Well, you hit on one of my favorite rules of money management.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.520]   If you can't explain something to your 14-year-old, you probably shouldn't do it.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   I actually think that's a legitimate great rule of thumb to stick with.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.520]   You should be able to explain what you're doing with money to your 14-year-old.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.800]   If you can, then it's probably a good idea and you understand it well enough to pursue
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   it.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.160]   But you should be very, very careful and very hesitant.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.000]   So in your question, there are embedded two different approaches.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.640]   One is technical and more of the financial product, kid the plan that you described,
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   work the way that you're describing it.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.560]   The second is more, how do I interact with this particular advisor?
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.880]   Are they giving me good advice, et cetera?
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.760]   Let me deal with the second one first just because I'm curious and because it'll be a
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.200]   little bit faster.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.440]   Have you worked with this advisor in other things?
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.760]   What types of business do you have with this advisor and have you worked with them with
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.920]   other areas of planning as well?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.120]   It's actually a new relationship that we just started.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.200]   It's actually the company, I guess I probably shouldn't give the name of the company, but
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.240]   it's working to help set up the college and picking the right colleges for the girls and
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.200]   kind of giving us an ACT prep and just kind of working towards that.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.440]   And he's kind of getting this whole package together to make the best plan going forward
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.960]   for our...basically for the next nine years, how do we prepare for college and while we're
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   in college and then getting out of college.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.200]   So it's a new relationship probably within the last two to three months.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.440]   Everything else he said seems to be above board and I totally understand it.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.080]   And this is the only one that just doesn't make sense.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.920]   When he explains it to me, he makes me sound like this is the greatest thing since sliced
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.400]   bread and then I get home and I go, "Man, it doesn't make sense to me."
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   Right.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.680]   So this is really interesting because I had a couple of friends of mine who were working
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   in this area.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   Let me describe the business model and see if this does fit.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.560]   What I'm hearing is this person is not a traditional financial advisor, for example, with a brokerage
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   firm, et cetera.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.640]   They're a college advisor and you've contracted with him to provide advice for you on where
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.460]   to go to college, how to prepare your children for college.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.480]   And as a component of that, he's talking with you about strategies of how to pay for college
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   effectively.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.480]   Is that right?
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   Exactly.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   Good.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480]   Okay.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.200]   So this is actually a business model that I actually was interested in because I think
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.640]   that this kind of service is a really unique offering in the financial advice.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.960]   It's kind of – let's just lump it in under the financial advice space.
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.160]   It's unique because it's very specialized knowledge and it's uniquely valuable.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.640]   I was actually attracted to the business model because it's such a marketable business model.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.620]   Many aspects of financial advice, it's hard to know how to market a service proactively.
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.840]   But when you can proactively market to somebody like you who has children who are a few years
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.320]   away from college, it's really, really good.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.160]   And I applaud you actually for working with somebody on this.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.320]   There are a ton of planning opportunities that I've seen where advisors like this can
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.960]   help you to do good planning.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's going to make a big – can make a big difference in your life and in your children's
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   life.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.360]   So as this relates to finances, some of these firms – it's my understanding that some
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   of them encourage their advisors to become licensed in life insurance to be able to implement
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.000]   what you are talking about and some of them don't.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.220]   So from your understanding, this particular advisor doesn't represent any other financial
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.040]   products other than just these types of life insurance products designed to solve kind
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   of this college need.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   Does that seem accurate?
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.200]   Yeah, to my knowledge, that sounds pretty accurate.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   OK, good.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.440]   So that just helps me to understand what we're working with and I'll just tell you kind
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.800]   of the short answer.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.200]   I don't think it's a scam.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.960]   I don't think it's runaway.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.840]   It's not something that I think is just an automatic, "Oh, we've got to run away
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.600]   from this," nor do I think that this is – I think you should always tread carefully.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.920]   If you can't explain it to your 14-year-old, you shouldn't do it.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.060]   I'll give you some more thoughts from my experience as well.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:40.220]   But this is unique because this particular advisor does have competence and experience
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.500]   in this aspect of college financial aid planning and that's different than most of the
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.620]   times where I hear about the intense marketing of whole life insurance, which is usually
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.940]   from a bank on yourself or – that's the biggest brand name in the space, the bank
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.820]   on yourself advisors who are not just focused on college.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.020]   Question, does this particular advisor – are they certified with any of the college-level
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.060]   college – I forget the name of it – with one of the college training certification
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.060]   designations?
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.060]   I don't know that.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.980]   Look at their business card.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.980]   Look at their website at some point and just check to see.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.460]   There is a – like a credential that's trying to be established in terms of this
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.460]   college planning and it would be good to see if the person has it.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.460]   All right.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.460]   I don't see that.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.460]   I'm looking at the business card.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.460]   I don't see that on there.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.460]   I'm looking at the business card.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.460]   I don't see that.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:42.980]   So in short, it's not – I don't immediately run away but I also do tread cautiously.
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.380]   So what I'm understanding is this advisor has represented to you and said in a few years,
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.580]   you're going to be filling out the FAFSA and would it be accurate to say, OK, how much
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.420]   money do you keep in cash on hand that he's going to be worrying about?
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.940]   What kind of dollars are we talking about here?
[00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.420]   He wants to take over about $200,000 to start to do the – or actually to pay up and basically
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.500]   pay for the whole thing pretty much in one lump sum.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.900]   And then we'd be funding it probably another $24,000 a year after that point going forward.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.860]   So $200,000 and what he's saying is on the FAFSA, the – what is it?
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:26.260]   The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, if you list this $200,000 as a cash asset
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.620]   in the bank and you list it as an asset, that will affect your – that will affect your
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:36.220]   eligibility for – your children's eligibility for other financial aid.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:41.300]   But if you hold this money within the context of life insurance policy, because it is not
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:47.740]   a listed asset on the FAFSA, it will save you – it will help your children to get
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.900]   qualified for more aid.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900]   Is that accurate?
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.900]   Michael Munger That's exactly where he's going with it,
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.900]   yes.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.780]   I think that's accurate and I did a show – I'll try to find it in a moment for
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:03.020]   you on some of the other – on college planning that will give you some of the other categories
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.100]   that often aren't talked about.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:11.500]   And I recommend to you that you go and you listen to that past show.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.860]   So I just paused and looked for it.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.620]   I think it may be episode 357 which was an interview with Brad Baldridge which was called
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.340]   Taming the High Cost of College, Understanding the Landscape of College Tuition, Financial
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.720]   Aid, Loans and Your Choices with Brad Baldridge.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.020]   Episode 429 I discussed should I use whole life insurance as a college savings plan.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.140]   So those would be a couple of episodes to look at.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.820]   I've done some others on college as well.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:47.940]   So the FAFSA – what this particular advisor is describing to you is not inaccurate.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:55.340]   What they're describing is that you can use – that these assets are not reported.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.140]   What's usually unsaid and what I would ask – what I would encourage you to kind of
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.260]   ask this advisor and see, are there other things other than life insurance which are
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.940]   also unreported?
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:12.420]   So for example, retirement assets, assets that you hold in a 401(k) plan or a 403(b)
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.900]   plan or just a simple IRA plan, these are also assets that are not reported on the FAFSA
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:25.900]   – I believe that home equity, equity that you have in your primary home, I believe that's
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.100]   not reported on your FAFSA.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:37.540]   I think that there is a difference between the FAFSA here and the CSS financial aid profile
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:45.620]   that's used by some colleges and universities that can be reflected as well.
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.460]   Life insurance is one of those – life insurance is one of those assets as well.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:55.500]   So the first thing that I would do if I were in your situation is go and download the FAFSA
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.700]   form and read it for yourself and read it and see all of the assets that are listed
[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.220]   and think through the assets that are not listed.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.980]   Because so often when you're trying to answer a financial question and say, "Should I
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.500]   do something or should I not do something?"
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.180]   The major thing that you face is the lack of the alternative choice, which the question
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.820]   you're asking me is, "Am I getting bad advice and am I getting screwed?"
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:26.580]   A lot of times the way that people get screwed is the alternative choice is omitted.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.500]   Something is held as, "This is the only way for you to do what you're trying to
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.180]   do," and the reality is it's not the only way for you to do it.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.240]   It is a way.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:40.060]   And so you should know that yes, life insurance would have that effect, but there are other
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.900]   potential ways for you to do it as well.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.540]   Are you tracking with me so far, Ken?
[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.940]   Yeah, I'm tracking with you.
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.140]   We actually sat down, we talked through several of those things as far as alternate choices,
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.220]   and he also said that an annuity would be another one of those other things.
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.940]   The home equity, sometimes, sometimes not.
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.860]   It depends on which type of school it is, whether or not that's qualified.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.740]   We've already been down the road of the retirement assets.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.620]   I'm pretty much maxed out as far as what I can put there.
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:18.140]   So this is kind of my last peg that I can use, I think, on the other alternate choices.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.140]   Good.
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.900]   Okay, so I'm becoming increasingly encouraged with the quality of the advice that you're
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.900]   receiving.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.820]   That's a good sign, because if you're getting these choices, if they're doing this analysis,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.380]   going over your options, these are signs of a competent advisor.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.140]   So I'm increasingly encouraged.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.460]   Now let's talk to your specific question about a life insurance policy.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.260]   Today's awesome show is being brought to you, Radicals, by HelloFresh.

[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.340]   On whose life is this advisor recommending to place the policy?
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:15:59.340]   Mine.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.340]   Okay.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.340]   Okay.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.420]   And how much of a face amount of contract are they considering?
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.140]   There's two parts, or three parts to it.
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.900]   The first part is a 20-year term for $1 million, and then the cash value whole life would be
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:19.500]   $200,000, and then the paid-up additions would be up to $40,000 per year that you could add.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   Okay.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:26.060]   And so the idea is that you could put $40,000 per year in for five years in order to get
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.740]   your $200,000 into the contract?
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:36.100]   I don't know if it was for five years, but I thought it was more than that, actually.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.300]   I thought it was $40,000 per year as long as I wanted to keep on adding it.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.580]   But he said if you can't go over the $40,000 the way it was written, otherwise it'll turn
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.460]   into a modified endowment contract.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.460]   Endowment contract.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.460]   Modified endowment contract.
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   Yes.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.460]   Okay.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.000]   So let me explain the basic.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.340]   Do you understand the basic concept of how life insurance contracts work?
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.020]   They accumulate cash value.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.900]   You could take loans against them, or you can distribute the proceeds, et cetera?
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.260]   I've seen the charts where it usually takes about 10 years before you even break even
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.820]   on what you've put into it.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.820]   That's right.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:09.060]   And so is that the so-called break-even point?
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.820]   How many years is it on the contract that you've been illustrated?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.940]   It depends on how much you put into it, but it's right around there.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:20.420]   I think it was right around the 10-year part, because based on what I think one of your
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:28.500]   shows you talked about, the increase in net value, which was the non-guaranteed assumptions,
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.980]   but that's the column that you're obviously looking at.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.460]   Well, you're definitely going to get this, even though it's not guaranteed.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:38.740]   And what company is the illustration run with?
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.220]   Lafayette Life Insurance Company.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.020]   I guess that's Western Southern.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:52.660]   So there are a couple of companies, of which I believe Lafayette is one of them, that they
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.780]   kind of specialize in some of these types of contracts, that they'll work and they'll
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.340]   work with some of the options for these types of programs.
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:08.220]   I have not done the research on their illustrations or their – I haven't done the research
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.940]   and I've never purchased a policy from them nor have I ever sold a policy with them.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.100]   So I can't speak personally to that.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.460]   The basic design can work.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.460]   And essentially, the contract that you're describing, where it has – internally to
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.140]   the contract, it has a million dollars of term insurance and $200,000 of whole life
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.140]   insurance.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.600]   And then over time, will those paid-up additions convert some of the term insurance to whole
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   life insurance?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.940]   Is that the way that the contract works?
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.300]   The way he explained it to me is the paid-up additions are in addition to – he says every
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:46.060]   time you put additions, once the whole life is fully funded, they actually build little
[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:52.500]   Lego blocks for best term and you keep on adding those and there are like many whole
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.660]   life policies that keep on getting added on to the policy as it continues to grow, as
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.620]   you continue to do the paid-up additions above and beyond the $200,000.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.220]   And those are the ones he's saying I can take out if I need to buy a new car or if
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.580]   I need to have my emergency fund because I need to replace my roof or something like
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.420]   that with those funds.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.660]   So it's an accurate statement.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.100]   So let's just start with kind of the beginning.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.100]   I'll try to explain simply how it works.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:24.460]   You can purchase a life insurance contract in a one-time lump sum for the sake of simplicity.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.660]   And let's say that you wanted to purchase a contract.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.540]   You have $200,000 of cash and how old are you, Ken?
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.540]   Forty-five.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.540]   Okay.
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.540]   So you're 45 years old.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.020]   You're a 45-year-old male and you have $200,000 of cash.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.380]   You could go to a life insurance company and say, "I would like to give you this $200,000
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.460]   and in exchange, I'd like for you to give me a life insurance policy and tell me how
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:53.060]   much money that would be – how much you'd be willing to insure my life for."
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:59.980]   Chances are – I'm hopeful I'm close on this, but they would give you a policy for
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.020]   let's say something like $400,000 of a lump sum contract.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.980]   And in that context, they would actually guarantee you that you would have let's say something
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.620]   like $180,000 of guaranteed cash value right away.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:21.540]   And so you can purchase this contract as a one-time payment for a one-time premium and
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.940]   you would get a high amount of life insurance death benefit and you would get some amount
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.180]   of cash value.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   Now in what's called single premium life, which is what I'm describing to you, the
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.620]   commissions are relatively small.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:38.900]   And so the idea of losing say on a $200,000 lump sum, the idea of losing $15,000 or $20,000
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.860]   in expenses right off the bat would be about expected and that would be money that you
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.180]   would not have access to.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.900]   So that's your immediate loss.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.200]   So if you cashed out the policy, you bought the policy on day one and then you cashed
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:57.780]   out the policy on days – a week later, you would be out $20,000 out of pocket.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.380]   On a policy like I'm describing, a single premium life, usually in say – depending
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.460]   on the rates that are credited to it, et cetera, usually in three or four years, you could
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:12.100]   be back in positive territory with regard to your – all of the money would be made
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.100]   back up.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   The commissions are paid.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.700]   The policy inception costs are taken care of and you'd be back whole with your $200,000
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.980]   in cash value.
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.300]   And so you could do that to the point where you say, "OK.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.780]   I've got – five years later, I've got $210,000 in this contract," and you continue
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:35.300]   to have your $400,000 or $500,000 of death benefit that is in force.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.300]   And that's a pretty good deal.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.340]   That's called single premium life insurance.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:45.500]   And this describes conceptually how the policy works because it shows you that when you put
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.480]   a lot of money into a life insurance contract, there's going to be a whole lot of money
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.420]   in the contract.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.140]   This is different than term insurance.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.980]   With term insurance, you're just buying death benefit.
[00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.020]   And so your premium is very, very low because you're only buying death benefit and you're
[00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.380]   only buying it for a short period of time.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.860]   With the – when you put a lot of money into a contract, a whole life insurance contract
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:14.140]   however, you wind up with a certain amount of money in the cash value.
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.300]   If you put a ton of money in, you wind up with a lot of money in the cash value because
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.020]   the risk for the insurance company is very, very low.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.100]   So they have a high reserve in the contract.
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:27.780]   Now, the problem of course with single premium life insurance is you lose out on your advantageous
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.660]   distribution of the money on a tax-free basis by taking a policy loan.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.820]   And that's what we're trying to avoid by having a contract and you immediately lose
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.940]   that with single premium life.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.300]   So what he's describing to you is accurate.
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.460]   You do have a contract and when you put paid up additions into the contract, you're basically
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.500]   sending lots of extra money to the insurance company and saying, "Hey, here's some extra
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.660]   money for you to put into the contract."
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.980]   When you do it, the advantage is you can bypass some of the costs of the insurance and you
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.860]   can bypass some of the costs of things like commissions, which is the biggest cost on
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.520]   a life insurance contract.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.780]   And so instead of a say 50 percent commission rate that gets paid out on a normal premium
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.460]   payment that you make into a life insurance contract, there's only a very tiny commission
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.780]   rate of maybe a couple percent that the agent receives on paid up additions.
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.900]   And so this makes a policy much more efficient and allows you to get a lot of money into
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.020]   the contract in the short term.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:33.300]   So it is very conceivable that a well-designed policy where you put $40,000 into it for – I
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.460]   kind of can't imagine a contract of only $1.2 million, a face amount, would accept
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.940]   that money beyond a decade.
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:45.060]   He's probably got it timed to where it would mech out in a decade or so.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.420]   But if you put $40,000 into a contract for a decade, it's very conceivable that at
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:56.100]   that point in time you could have $450,000 of cash value in it and you could have $1.2
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.700]   million, $1.5 million of death benefit.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.680]   So that can work.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.780]   Now the question is what can I do with the money?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.780]   Make sense?
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.780]   Are we together so far?
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.780]   Okay.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.780]   Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.500]   So when you go to distribute the money from a life insurance contract, there are a couple
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.300]   of ways that you can do it.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.260]   Either number one, you can cancel the contract.
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.060]   At any point in time with a whole life insurance contract, you can cancel it and you can just
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.340]   simply take the money.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:28.660]   So you could walk away and let's say that for sake of comparison, let's say you've
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.660]   put in $400,000.
[00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.220]   That's called your basis.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:34.500]   That's the total amount of the premiums that you've contributed to the contract.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:41.660]   Let's say 10 years from now your policy is scheduled to have $475,000 of cash value.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.020]   That's your cash value.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.140]   And your death benefit at that point in time would be $1.3 million.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:53.620]   So if you walk away from it, you'll receive back your $475,000 of cash value.
[00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.660]   You'll give up the death benefit.
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.460]   You'll receive your basis out tax-free.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:06.260]   You would receive $400,000 of basis back tax-free and you would receive the balance of $75,000.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:12.340]   You would receive that back as ordinary income and it would be taxed to you as ordinary income.
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.260]   So anytime you surrender a life insurance contract, that's the way that the money works.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.540]   That's the way that the tax works.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.540]   You understand that?
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.540]   Yep.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.140]   Now, another option that you always have with a whole life insurance contract is to be able
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.140]   to take out a policy loan.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:33.020]   And a policy loan, because it's a loan, it's an advance of the death benefit, a policy
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:39.540]   loan, as long as the policy stays in force, a policy loan can be received income tax-free.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.780]   And the reason is that it's an advance of death benefit.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.780]   Any life insurance contract, term insurance, whole life insurance, any contract of any
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.300]   kind, when a death benefit is paid out, will pay out that death benefit free of federal
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.100]   income taxes, free of any income taxes.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:59.900]   So if you die and you have a $1.3 million policy in force, your family gets $1.3 million
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.900]   of cash.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.700]   Now, let's say that on most policies, you can usually borrow out of a policy up to about
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.160]   90% of the cash value.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:15.980]   So if you had $475,000 of cash, you could take out a $400,000 loan against the contract.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.500]   That loan, if you die, would be repaid by the policy.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.220]   So instead of your family receiving $1.3 million for the death benefit, they'd receive $1.3
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.220]   million less, the $400,000 loan, they would receive a $900,000 check.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.580]   You can take that loan out.
[00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.360]   It's not recognized as income.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.480]   You can do anything that you want with it.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:41.560]   You can spend it, you can use it to pay for your car, your college, all of those things.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.040]   And you don't necessarily have to pay it back.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.500]   As long as the policy stays in force, you don't have to pay it back.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.140]   Now, here are the two things that happen to the money.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.580]   You will pay an interest payment on the money.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.220]   And the interest payment will vary depending on the company and depending on the way that
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.780]   you choose, whether you choose a steady interest rate or an adjustable interest rate.
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.480]   And so every year there will be an interest payment due on the $400,000.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:11.400]   And the reason is this was a company asset, a reserve amount in a life insurance policy.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.820]   But now they have loaned the money out.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.400]   From the company's perspective, they loaned the money out.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.360]   And so there needs to be a return.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.120]   And then also depending on the company, however, if you're going to pay an interest payment,
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.320]   depending on the company, depending on the way that they recognize the loan on their
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.960]   books, they may also grant a dividend payment on that loan.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:40.680]   So there will be a cost to the loan, but the net cost will probably be pretty small.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:47.040]   The net cost of this can often be as little as 2% or 3% by the time you take in the difference
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.120]   between the amount of interest payment that you're paying and the amount of interest that
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.560]   the company is crediting to you in the loan.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.220]   It can be a very small number.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:00.640]   So you can keep that loan on the policy for a very long period of time or for a short
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.180]   period of time.
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:08.760]   This is how people who represent life insurance as this particular financial tool, this is
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   how they do it.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.060]   And so they're saying, for example, bank on yourself very classically, pay yourself the
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:21.360]   interest on the money and you can take the money out and you can use it for things that
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.040]   you want to.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.340]   And you'll receive the interest now in the context of your life insurance instead of
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:30.460]   paying it to a bank.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.680]   As long as you have a large amount of money in the policy, this is my opinion, as long
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:41.300]   as you have a large amount of money in the policy and as long as you have a relatively
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:51.100]   low usage from the contract, the contract can stay healthy and the plan can work.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:57.580]   Where I get nervous is if the plans are pushed to the extreme and you're taking out a $420,000
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:03.340]   loan on a $475,000 policy and you're taking it out without any plans of paying it back
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.820]   within a couple – within a few years.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.220]   Then I think basically the contracts start to blow up.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.060]   They start to get out of hand and they have to be managed carefully.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.460]   So as with anything with life insurance, it's a crazy complicated idea, which is why you
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.460]   can't explain it to your 14-year-old, but that's fundamentally how it works.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.060]   So that's probably the question.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.140]   Since he's talking about these paid-up additions where I can continue to pay into the policy
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.660]   and then use that almost as a savings account, he was talking that, "Hey, you put in – this
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.980]   year you only have $5,000 to put in an addition.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:40.980]   That's great.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   Next year you only have $1,000.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.580]   The next year you have $10,000.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.420]   And then the following year you need to pull money out."
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.420]   He goes, "That's fine.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.380]   You can pull money out at any time and you'd never have to pay it back."
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.580]   And so that's the kind of language that is often used that makes me nervous.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.420]   And in a sense, it is technically correct.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:06.260]   As long as the policy dividend rate is being paid out and it's substantial, as long as
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.180]   those interest payments are covered and as long as the policy stays in force, you don't
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.500]   technically ever have to pay the loan back.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.540]   However, if something changes, if there are – there's a significant decrease in dividends
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:28.460]   or if you stop paying premiums or if interest rates – well, if interest rates rise, dividends
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.460]   would follow.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:35.660]   But if there's a substantial change, then the policy can start to be – the policy
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.940]   can start to be on thin ice.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.140]   I can't actually explain this verbally.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:46.220]   If I had an insurance license, which I don't anymore, and if I were selling life insurance,
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.940]   which I don't, I would be sitting with you and I would show you and I would illustrate
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.580]   a couple of different scenarios.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.020]   And here's why this is very important.
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:02.180]   Back in the '80s, a lot of life insurance policies were sold under very optimistic assumptions.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.860]   And in the illustrations that you have seen, there will be some kind of assumption that
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:14.020]   has been made as far as what rate of return is this policy earning on its cash values.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.180]   If that assumption turns out to be right, everything will function as has been illustrated
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.260]   to you.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:25.640]   But if that assumption turns out to be wrong, then things will change.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.940]   Life insurance illustrations are not guaranteed pro forma representations of how something
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.320]   will function.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:41.900]   They are illustrations of how something would function under certain circumstances.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.360]   So that's where it's impossible for someone like me to comment on it until or unless you
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.780]   see what the actual assumptions were.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.240]   So back in the '80s, a lot of people were buying life insurance policies and the dividend
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:32:04.780]   rate that was being assigned as crediting to the policy might have been 12%, 13%, 14%,
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:12.640]   15%, which is insanely high when compared to the historical return of life insurance.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.140]   Remember always that life insurance, when the company is investing your premiums and
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.420]   you're using the life insurance policy that's drawn on the company's general portfolio,
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:30.820]   the vast majority of that portfolio is invested in fixed income securities, which are always
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:36.900]   going to have a lower rate of return than something like stocks.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:41.500]   Life insurance companies have to invest their money very, very conservatively because they
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.180]   have major draws on the money, major potential draws on the money.
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:51.800]   They have to have the portfolio set to make big payments out when they pay out death benefits.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:58.100]   So because of that, life insurance portfolios will generally perform more like a fixed income
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.260]   fund than they will like a stock fund in terms of long-term rates of return.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:08.780]   And so many life insurance agents sold these policies and represented them at 12%, 13%,
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.240]   14% interest rates.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.980]   And then all throughout the '90s and then the 2000s, interest rates plummeted.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.260]   And today, they've been historically low for historically long.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.300]   Well, those policies started to blow up.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.540]   And by blow up, I mean you needed to write big premium payments.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.420]   A lot of them were sold using the terminology which is now banned in the industry called
[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:31.420]   vanishing premium, where it was sold under the idea that you can purchase this contract,
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.740]   you can pay the premium, but then over time, you won't have to pay the premium anymore.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.420]   The premium will vanish.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.540]   And if everything had performed as it was illustrated, that would have worked.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:44.940]   But because interest rates declined, that didn't work.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.220]   Now, in today's world, it's much safer because the companies, generally, as long as it's
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:54.500]   an ethical company, they are going to make sure that those illustrations are run at something
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.380]   close to today's rates.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.280]   And today's rates are historically low.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:04.040]   And so it's unlikely to have those major changes in the policy.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.460]   And so you're much safer with your illustration.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.620]   And I've kind of gotten off in the ditch with my explanation.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.020]   I forgot the question that you asked.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.180]   Go ahead, Ken, with your response and follow-up question, please.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.580]   No, you pretty much hit it.
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.500]   With the paid-up additions, being able to take the money back out, something you've
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.660]   been saving for a new car, whatever the case is, and not having to pay that loan back.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:33.740]   And that's where reading some of the stuff online is just, I read about it imploding
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.980]   on itself because of the interest is going to the bank, not necessarily the interest
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:43.100]   paying back into your account on these loans.
[00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.900]   And that's where it kind of gets a little bit fuzzy for me as far as how I can, every
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.620]   year put in $40,000 up to that amount or whatever the case is, and then just take the money
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.860]   out and not have to worry about paying it back.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.100]   That's kind of where the question came.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.100]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:02.620]   And so when I have looked at this issue, I have never personally become confident with
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.220]   this language of never paying it back.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:11.820]   I hate to hear that because I feel like that's an overstatement of the circumstances.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.380]   It's not that it couldn't technically happen.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.740]   And here's again where we fail for lack of numbers, we fail for lack of an illustration
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.020]   program that we could actually run some scenarios on and demonstrate.
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.780]   It's not that I couldn't design a contract where I would never have to pay it back.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.620]   For example, I own some whole life insurance policies, have some for me, for my wife, I
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.420]   have them for my children.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.140]   I have cash value in those policies.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:43.140]   I could take out a small portion of the cash value in one of my policies that's fairly
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.140]   mature.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.260]   I could take it out, I could spend it on whatever I wanted to spend it on, and I could technically
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.220]   never have to pay it back.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:54.780]   As long as I continue to pay my normal premium payments, I could never pay it back.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.900]   That policy would accrue interest, that policy loan would accrue interest throughout my entire
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.900]   lifetime.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.460]   Remember, of course, that I could only just pay the interest payment or I can have the
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.540]   policy itself, the cash value, pay the interest payment.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.660]   And I could technically never pay it back.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.420]   That doesn't mean that it's a good thing for me not to pay it back.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:20.040]   And that's where this – the kind of the gap between advisors and consumers often comes
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.860]   into play.
[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.740]   As an advisor, I would look at that and I would say, "Is this cheap money?"
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.140]   Because basically what a life insurance loan is, it's a personal loan that's secured
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:37.620]   by the collateral of a cash value life insurance policy, which is very, very safe collateral.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.780]   And so I just look at that and I say, "Is this a good, cheap source of money?"
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.620]   Now what's very flexible about a life insurance policy and using cash value as collateral
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.800]   is I can always get the money right out of the contract.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.980]   But I could also get money from other places.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.580]   And so there have been times when I've done analysis on life insurance policies and working
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.780]   with people, sometimes your best bet is just to owe the money to the insurance company.
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:09.060]   Sometimes your best bet is to go down to the local credit union, take out a personal loan
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.660]   there, and then pledge some of the collateral – pledge the life insurance contract as
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.300]   collateral to them and sometimes you'll get a better deal.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.740]   So this is where I think the bank on yourself and the kind of the sales language that you're
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.860]   hearing I think is a little bit overstated.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.820]   Not that it's completely wrong, not that it's technically wrong, just that it's
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.020]   exaggerated beyond my personal comfort level.
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:37.900]   So I would ask – here's how you solve it, kind of to get practical and try to help
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.980]   you with your practical question.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:46.060]   I would ask this particular consultant to model and illustrate for you a couple of things.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.820]   Have him illustrate for you – in the illustration software we're doing – have him illustrate
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:59.020]   the scenario on – let me pause for a moment.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.220]   When you do an illustration, the illustration software will demonstrate the premium payment
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.860]   that you're making into the contract and it will demonstrate the cash value that's
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:13.100]   projected in the contract, the death benefit that's projected in the contract, and the
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:17.900]   amount of any policy loans that you project in the contract.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.580]   So I wouldn't expect you – if you did purchase this particular contract and you
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.860]   put $40,000 per year into the contract, you wouldn't do that for the rest of your life,
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.860]   right?
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.860]   No.
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:35.540]   In fact, to add one more little wrinkle into all of this, my goal is to retire in 10 years.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:40.340]   So the money that I'd be putting into here is kind of like my bridge loan is, but the
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:46.220]   way I'm kind of thinking in my head, I can't get at my 401(k) or IRA until I'm 59 and
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.260]   a half, so if I want to retire at 55, I need to find a way to get from 55 to 59 and a half.
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.940]   So that's kind of where I'm trying to plan for that gap right now, and that's
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.140]   where this money would be.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.260]   So my thought would be in 10 years, I'd want to start pulling money out for living
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.220]   expenses because this would get me to 59 and a half when I could start pulling out of my
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.140]   other retirement account, if that makes sense.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.580]   Yeah, I would be nervous about that.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:13.780]   If I were an advisor and you were telling me that, I would not want you to do that because
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:22.660]   a life insurance contract is not productive enough for you to pay that out short term.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:27.300]   Remember this, so the only benefit you – so the big benefit that you get with life insurance,
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:32.220]   and we're kind of conflating many conversations here by talking about college, but the big
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.160]   – in your case, one of the potential benefits that you're hoping for with a life insurance
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:42.020]   contract is the fact that these assets are not required to be listed as use assets on
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.340]   the FAFSA.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:44.340]   What is a benefit?
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:50.420]   I don't know what the impact of that would be on your children's eligibility for student
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.420]   aid.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.860]   That's this advisor's job to tell you, is this important or not.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.820]   I mean, with your overall financial profile, is this even relevant or is this not relevant?
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.500]   So that's their job to calculate that.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.300]   It's beyond my expertise.
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:08.660]   But the other benefit of life insurance, the major benefit is the value of having the money
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:11.740]   and the value of the deferred tax on the growth.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.260]   You could also say, well, it's a safe asset and things like that.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.860]   But there are lots of safe assets that you can buy and for a short term – on a short
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.300]   term period, you can put the money in plenty of safe assets.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.700]   Other example would be creditor protection.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:27.020]   Yes, it's creditor protection, but that – unless you tell me there's a big concern
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.940]   for you, let's ignore some of those.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.740]   The big benefit you're saying is, well, I want my money to grow.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.280]   Here's the problem.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.560]   Life insurance contracts, whole life insurance contracts do not work well for short term
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.220]   financial needs.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:43.820]   The reason is, one, they have too many expenses that are front-loaded.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.940]   There are too many costs up front to work for short term needs.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.980]   So for 10-year dollars, for 20-year dollars, 20-year dollars would be the minimum dollars,
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.900]   the minimum time horizon that I'd ever want to be pulling out of a life insurance contract.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.260]   For 20-year dollars, I want other – I want CD ladders.
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.660]   I want shorter term things that are more liquid.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:08.940]   Now 30-year dollars, 40-year dollars, 50-year dollars, these are great dollars for a life
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.260]   insurance contract.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.100]   But 10-year dollars are not good dollars for a life insurance contract because there's
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:19.020]   not enough time for the contract to make up for its heavy establishment costs.
[00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.020]   There's too many expenses up front.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.260]   Just like – think of it like buying a house.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.140]   Very few people can successfully wheel and deal and sell out of their house every five
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.420]   to ten years and make money.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:34.140]   There are too many costs to realtors' commissions, fixing it up, buying new curtains, repainting,
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.140]   replacing stuff.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.580]   Like it just doesn't work for most people.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.500]   Life insurance contracts are the same thing.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.900]   The second reason is there's not enough time for there to be any substantial growth
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.740]   in money such that the tax savings are actually worth anything.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:52.540]   If you put in $40,000 per year and ten years from now you have $475,000, all you've effectively
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:59.180]   done is given yourself the ability to defer the tax on the $75,000 of growth.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.180]   Big deal.
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.900]   Like that's really not all that useful.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   So for this, for what you're describing, I don't like it.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:09.460]   I don't think it's a good solution for your bridge money, not unless the policy were
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.500]   put in place 20 years ago.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.580]   Now my policies, which were all put in place when I'm much younger than you, my policies
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:21.260]   could work really well as bridge contracts, as bridge policies.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.900]   Because if I were in your solution and I started the policies earlier, 55 years old, and now
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:32.260]   I'm in a situation where I'm trying to retire at 55, I'll have plenty of cash value.
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.420]   And then in that situation, I can easily use those policies.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.340]   I can do loans out of the contracts, which I pay in later with other funds if I take
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.260]   them out without penalties, et cetera, and they're really, really useful.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.940]   So I love whole life insurance contracts.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.860]   I think they're valuable components of the whole.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   But they don't generally work as like the catch-all, end-all, be-all.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:59.260]   They work as one asset among many that have unique advantages that can – unique attributes
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.700]   that fit well in an overall portfolio.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.260]   Wow, that's awesome.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:10.500]   That's exactly what I was hoping to hear from you, is that every time I kind of sat
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.220]   down to look through this, it just kind of got overwhelming as I'm trying to put all
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.900]   these pieces together and nobody was clear enough to give me that picture.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.660]   So I really appreciate your insight into this.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   Thank you so much.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.660]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.740]   And then back to you, I want to give you kind of your action step, what you should do with
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.820]   this advisor, OK?
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.500]   I think you're getting decent advice.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:32.060]   I don't know this particular advisor's amount of experience, but I haven't yet heard any
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:35.500]   danger science that would say, "Let me run for the hills screaming."
[00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:42.700]   I think you're getting decent advice, a little bit of exaggeration perhaps, but I mean that's
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.060]   not red flags.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.740]   It's kind of like the real estate agent saying, "You're going to love the house."
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:49.580]   Well, the real estate agent doesn't know if you're going to love the house or not.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:55.300]   Now here's how you can try to make a good decision.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:02.140]   Take a scenario that you think is practical for how you actually want to use the policy
[00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.140]   and run that.
[00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:08.640]   So for example, you're not going to put $40,000 of premiums into the policy for 30 more years.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.660]   You're planning to retire in 10 years.
[00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:15.000]   So start by saying, "Here's what I want you to illustrate for me.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.780]   Let's put $40,000 into the contract for 10 years.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:24.060]   Then let's put $0 because you don't want to be putting money into a life insurance contract
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.540]   when you're retired.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.420]   So put $0 for the rest of my life."
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.720]   Now this is simple to run with illustration software.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.700]   They can show you $40,000 in for 10 years and $0 for the rest of your life.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.780]   Then you can look at those numbers.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.380]   Then think about when you'd want to take money out.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.540]   Let's say that – have them illustrate my bridge money.
[00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:51.540]   Show me how much money I could take out of the contract for 10 years between 55 and 65
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.380]   or show me how I would take the money out for my kid's college.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.700]   If you're trying to hide this $200,000 inside the contract over the next four years, five
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.180]   years before you have to fill out the FAFSA, that's reasonable.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:09.380]   Then illustrate the distribution from the contract for those years of college.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:15.940]   I want to pay $15,000 or $20,000 from the contract for this six to eight-year span of
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:17.580]   my children in college.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.860]   Then show me what happens with the contract.
[00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.300]   Then show me putting the money back in.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.740]   They'll show you with the loans.
[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:28.260]   Now look down towards the end of your life and have them illustrate the full policy term
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.020]   out to age 120.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:35.300]   You'll start to see how those loan balances accrue and how the interest accrues.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.820]   You'll start to see – because what can sometimes happen is all of a sudden now at age 83, the
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:46.540]   contract is saying, "Hey, we want a premium payment of $82,000."
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:51.700]   Well, that's what I mean when I say the policy is blowing up.
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.340]   Have the advisor illustrate a few different scenarios for you and I think you'll start
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.540]   to feel more comfortable with kind of how it works.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.460]   Then ask yourself the question and say, "Does this work for me?"
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.460]   Perfect.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.460]   Okay.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.460]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:08.460]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.820]   I'm not running screaming for the hills, but I'm also being very careful.
[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.180]   We're talking big money and you don't want to make a mistake here because the cost of
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.460]   making a mistake is there.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:23.900]   So don't do it until or unless you can explain it to your 14-year-old and get other counsel.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.580]   When you're buying a life insurance contract, get a second opinion.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.500]   Find another agent from another company nearby.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:34.860]   Say, "Here's what I'm thinking about doing," and have another agent show you what they
[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.300]   can do and use the value of the market and good competition.
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:43.740]   Well, Nassar, you mentioned wanting to make it from 55 to – or wanting to bridge from
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.300]   55 to 65.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.020]   Do you work at a company that you have a 401(k) plan with?
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.380]   You're familiar with the rule on a 401(k) plan that if you leave the company you're
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.520]   working at with a 401(k) at 55, you can do so without paying penalty on your distributions
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.900]   from the 401(k) account?
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.900]   Maybe not.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:07.420]   So I knew if you left the company, then you would normally switch that over to – into
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.420]   an IRA.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.420]   You wouldn't necessarily keep it at the company, correct?
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.840]   Yes, except in your situation, you should not move to an IRA.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:21.060]   So if you are working at a company and you have a 401(k) with that company, with the
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:28.620]   company that you're working with, if you retire at 55, anywhere from 55 to 59, if you
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:35.060]   retire at 55 and if you're still working for that company, then you can make a withdrawal
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.380]   from the 401(k) plan and you won't pay any early retirement penalties, even if you're
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.800]   before 59 and a half.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:48.860]   So that is really important for you to notice, to pay attention to, because with bridge money,
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.020]   what you're probably talking about is how do I get money out of all these accounts without
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.020]   paying penalties.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.020]   You're not talking to me about how do I pay for it, right?
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.020]   Right.
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.660]   So the first thing that you should be aware of is if you're planning on retiring at
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:07.420]   55, you can do a withdrawal from your 401(k) as long as that's the company that you are
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:09.060]   retiring from.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.700]   And of course it will be income and you'll pay taxes on the money, but you're not going
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.660]   to be paying the 10% penalty tax.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:22.820]   And that is – that's really valuable for you.
[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:31.100]   And the other thing is the planning opportunity for you is I am 98% sure that there shouldn't
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:37.900]   be any reason why you can't – yeah, I'm 99% sure that there's no reason why you couldn't
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.220]   put IRA money into the 401(k).
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:48.780]   And what I mean is if you have IRA money that's in a separate IRA from an old company and
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:54.020]   you could go ahead and move it over today into your company 401(k) and then that money
[00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:59.980]   would be available to you during that window between 55 and 59.5, that now you could get
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:02.060]   it out penalty-free.
[00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.860]   And so that's really important for you to be aware of.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:11.260]   The second thing to be aware of, even if you do have to pay early retirement penalties,
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:16.380]   it's still better for you to use retirement accounts and just pay the penalties.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:23.900]   I did an episode on this and this was something that was new for me.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:30.700]   It's episode 314 called How You Can Get More Money for Early Retirement by Using an
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:35.380]   IRA or 401(k) Even If You Have to Pay the 10% Penalty.
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:40.620]   And in essence, what I demonstrated on that episode, thanks to a listener who demonstrated
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:46.420]   it to me, is I proved that even if you have to pay the 10% penalty, you're still better
[00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.920]   off putting money in the IRA or the 401(k) and just paying the penalty than you are using
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.980]   an after-tax investment account.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.740]   Now that's assuming of course that you can still contribute.
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:02.580]   So if you're maxing everything out, of course you'd have to use an after-tax option then.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.900]   But even if you wanted to retire at 55, you're still better off just paying the penalty than
[00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:10.700]   not choosing to put it into a retirement account.
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:11.700]   Okay.
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:18.340]   Now, when you're talking about taking it from the 401(k) after 55, retiring from that company,
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.100]   is there a required minimum distribution?
[00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.020]   There's nothing that you have to set up saying, "Okay, every year I'm going to take this amount."
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:26.820]   You could actually just take a little bit or you can change the amounts you'd withdraw
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.980]   at that point from 55, 56, 57 type of deal, right?
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:30.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.380]   There's no required minimum distributions from a 401(k) account until age 70 and a half.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:40.820]   So you can choose at any point in time how much money you need.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.620]   So you can start off and take a little bit and you could take a little bit more.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.760]   The key is just simply that if it's a plan that you – it's easy.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.460]   If you are leaving a company and this is your employer right before retiring and you're
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.220]   taking money from that 401(k) plan, you avoid the penalty tax and you can pick how much
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.220]   you take out.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.260]   So this is probably a silly question, but you said right before you retire.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.380]   What is the official definition of retiring, just the last company you worked at before
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.380]   you quit?
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.740]   Good question because I never actually – I'm only aware of the rule academically.
[00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.380]   I've never actually filled out the paperwork for somebody.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:26.420]   Yes, I would say it's probably just whatever company you're working with right before
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.420]   you quit.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:33.780]   Again, I've never filled out the paperwork, so I don't know exactly kind of how that
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:39.300]   is demonstrated, but you should be able to find that pretty simply.
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.300]   Okay.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.300]   Wow.
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.300]   Worth your time today?
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.300]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.300]   Are you kidding me?
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:48.020]   This is just – this is priceless.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.820]   Now you've given me a lot of homework to do.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:51.820]   And that's what I need.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.140]   I need to have some direction which way to go.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.060]   So you've given me all that and a box of chocolate.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.820]   So I really do appreciate your help on this.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:03.900]   On IRS.gov, if I can remember, I will put here – I'll try to put – remember to
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:11.140]   put a link in the show notes.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:19.500]   But on IRS.gov, they have an article called "Retirement Topics, Exceptions to Tax on
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.780]   Early Distributions."
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:28.260]   And what you want is called the "Separation from Service Exception."
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.140]   So it's "The employee separates from service during or after the year the employee reaches
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:39.380]   age 55 or age 50 for public safety employees of a state or political subdivision of a state
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.940]   in a governmental-defined benefit plan."
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.820]   And so that's the separation from service.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:48.380]   I don't know what the paperwork looks like, but it should be very simple for you to find
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:54.740]   that and just calculate however much money you need in that 401(k) to get you through.
[00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:58.860]   And then with that as well, if you had another side business that you're running, would
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.100]   that get in the way because you're making income in another business even though maybe
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.420]   that separate business that you're running doesn't have a 401(k) set up?
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.940]   Would that kind of conflict with that?
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.820]   I don't think it would conflict with that because we're just talking about here taking
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.080]   distributions from a plan and we're just talking about the benefits.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.920]   So as long as you're just taking standard distributions, what the IRS calls "regular
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.240]   withdrawals" from the account, as long as you're just taking regular withdrawals from
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.920]   the account, it doesn't matter that you have other income.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.460]   It's just simply the income from there and being able to avoid the 10% penalty.
[00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.460]   So cool.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.460]   Thank you for calling in, Ken.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.460]   I appreciate it.
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   Let's go on.
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.460]   I've got one more caller on the line.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:38.400]   Oops, I just muted this caller.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.600]   Let's try again.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   How can I serve you today?
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.720]   Let's try again.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   Hi, Jayeshwar.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   Hi, welcome.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   Hi, Jayeshwar.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   My name is Ram.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   Actually, I have one quick question.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   Can I go ahead?
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   Yes, please.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.720]   Go ahead.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:10.840]   So I have around the 200K between my rollover 401(k) spouse IRA, Roth IRA, and my non-retirement
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   accounts.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:22.080]   So right now, these accounts are between the Wealthfront, Betterment, and Personal Capital.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.760]   So actually, I mean, after observing, I mean, since two, three years, I'm just observing
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.800]   kind of returns and how they're managing my accounts and all those things.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:35.800]   But finally, at this point in time, I'm seriously thinking moving all these accounts into Personal
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.640]   Capital for a couple of reasons.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.800]   The first reason would be, like, I want to keep all my money with one investment firm.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.880]   That way, they will apply the same strategy across the board.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:56.640]   And also, if my account total worth is, like, more than 200K, I think they have a special
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:03.680]   treatment, wherein they're going to buy my individual stocks and some kind of ETFs, mix
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   and match both.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.120]   I know, I mean, the investment management fee is a little bit high, because I'm in my
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   day work.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   I'm a little busy.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.600]   I don't think I can follow all those things.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:16.720]   And then I can spend a lot of time on this rebalancing and all those things.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.480]   So what do you suggest?
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   I mean, is it worth moving all these accounts into one Personal Capital account?
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.160]   I mean, not one account, multiple accounts, but under the same management.
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.800]   So do you have any specific suggestions?
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.080]   I'm a little confused there.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:44.200]   So speaking conceptually, there is generally, in my opinion, no reason to keep money with
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:55.680]   different money managers, unless the different money managers are pursuing some unique, dramatic
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.080]   investment idea.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:07.040]   Let's say you have $200,000, and you want $50,000 to be invested into speculative mining
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   stocks.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.640]   Well, there you'd have to find, who am I going to invest that speculative $50,000 with?
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.600]   And you'd put your other $150,000 with another manager.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:22.320]   But as far as describing wealth front betterment Personal Capital, these are all basically
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:28.960]   mainstream financial approach with a slight technological twist.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.320]   There's not any, in my opinion, there's not any major difference between these.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.720]   All are pursuing the same fundamental approach.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:42.780]   And so as long as in this situation, I see no benefit to having multiple advisors and
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.040]   only cost.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.540]   The key is to recognize that when you're hiring an investment manager, the amount of money
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.780]   that you have with the manager matters.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:54.520]   And it matters because it buys you lower fees.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.780]   That's what you're describing when you talk about Personal Capital will give you a lower
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.780]   fee.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.440]   This is called a breakpoint in the business.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:08.540]   You have lower fees, that's in your best interest, that gives you, that saves you money.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.160]   And it also, frankly, allows you to get better service.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:15.080]   Now most of these are automated or semi-automated versions.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.160]   But if you have a lot of money, you want to have it in one place because you get better
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.200]   service.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.320]   Better to be a big fish and get big fish service than to have all your money spread out and
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.040]   get little fish service everywhere.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.040]   Okay.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.040]   That makes sense.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:37.200]   And a similar line, because when I do my own R&D, especially average account size with
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.440]   Betterment and Bellfront is around 30, 40K.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.520]   And when I did my own research with Personal Capital, I think the average account size
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.620]   would be around 100, 150, 200K.
[00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:55.040]   So because most of the clients under Personal Capital is around average network would be
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.920]   average account size would be around 200, 300.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:03.240]   So I think my, as far as my requirements, that is one of the key decisions why I'm moving
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   towards this.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.840]   I mean, I know you are not going to say that don't go or go, but at least that's my driving
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:09.840]   factor.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.360]   And when it comes to the fees wise, I know I'm sure Bellfront and Betterment are charging
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.680]   very less, but Personal Capital is charging little high, like 0.8 or something for my
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   money.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:26.480]   But somehow I'm convinced I think it's okay because they have some, like, you know, they
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.920]   have bigger size accounts.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:34.360]   There they can perform, I mean, there they can show a lot of expertise, their expertise
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.360]   to manage my account.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.760]   I don't see any problem with what you're saying.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.900]   You've done your research.
[00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.080]   You've thought through the approach.
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.400]   The key is just simply for you to know what you're buying and what you're paying.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.560]   As long as you know what you're buying and what you're paying, I'm happy.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:55.960]   And you will be a better investor by choosing somebody carefully that you feel confident
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.640]   that you like their strategy, you like their service, you like their offerings.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:03.720]   You'll be a better investor because you'll be confident in the decision that you're making.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:08.920]   And then that confidence in your decision will allow you to basically stick with it
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:14.520]   through, to stick with it through the tough times.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.840]   I personally, my philosophy, the reason why I'm not weighing in and saying you have to
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:23.760]   choose this over another, I think it matters as far as your choice here matters.
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.680]   But it's not, doesn't matter nearly so much as all the other important stuff like, am
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.720]   I saving money?
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   You're doing that.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.720]   Do I actually have investments?
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.200]   You're doing that.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.640]   Things like, am I actually investing?
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.560]   You know, the actual type of account, your actual asset allocation with any of these
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:46.480]   companies will drive your, will drive your returns far more than which company it happens
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:47.560]   to be.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:52.200]   And then you sticking with it, you the investor sticking with the strategy through the crash
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.160]   that's coming and through the boom that's coming, that will make a big difference.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   So you sound like you're well educated on it.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.800]   I'm very happy with whatever decision you make.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.280]   But my concern was only with management fees.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.360]   So with respect to these three, personal capital management fees, 0.89, and with respect to
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.720]   betterment and welfare, it is 0.25, 0.25.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:20.600]   I mean, that's where I was a little reluctant to move to the personal capital, but you know,
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.120]   you see what I'm saying?
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.360]   I mean, everywhere, whatever research that I did, make sure the fees should be low because
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:27.360]   it's going to be longterm.
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.240]   It's going to be really add a good value to your account.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.200]   Make sure the fees are as much as possible low and all right.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.480]   So yeah, that's where a little confusion I have.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.120]   Do you believe that based upon what personal capital is offering to you, what they're saying,
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.400]   them saying, "Hey, listen, we're going to do these things for you.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.240]   And here's the benefits you get with investing for us."
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.600]   Do you believe that the benefits are there, that the benefits that they're offering are
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:06.000]   sufficient and you're willing to pay an extra 64 basis points for that service?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.120]   I mean, actually, pretty much whatever other services that they're providing outside investment
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.160]   management, I don't think a person like me, that is a really value added, right?
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.680]   Because I'm always, I'm doing my own R&D and I'm following you and listening to all your
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.400]   podcasts and pretty much whatever they're offering, already I know.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.120]   I mean, I'm not going any other things what they're offering.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.880]   I'm interested only in investment management because I don't have much time to think about
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880]   it.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.480]   And as you said, like in the panic times, how to manage and to take care of all those
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.000]   things, I need some help.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.120]   But rest of the things like how to save, how to invest and rest of all things, pretty much
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.120]   everything you are covering.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.840]   And I'm pretty much following every episode of you, right?
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   Through podcast.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:03.320]   So I don't think they're providing any other value other than this particular item.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.240]   So I need to be careful.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.200]   I have to be careful legally because I am not a financial advisor.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.960]   I cannot advise you to buy or to sell securities.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.120]   And that's why people like me always have to be careful.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.680]   I can't tell you choose this company, don't choose that company.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.000]   I don't know enough about you even to do it.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.440]   But here's how you need to approach it.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:28.440]   Number one, you've listened to me enough to kind of handle all the other stuff.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:35.480]   So now when you're at the stage of saying, I need to choose an investment manager, by
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:42.600]   what makes sense to you, if you were only focused on the lowest fees possible, which
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   some people are, then all three of these options are still going to be slightly more expensive
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:52.400]   than what you could go and find a broad market index fund from.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:03:00.120]   I mean Vanguard has index funds that I think are down and have 13, 15, 20 basis points
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.200]   of cost.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:07.320]   So that's cheaper than 13 basis points is half the cost of 25 basis points that you're
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.640]   describing.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.820]   So you could get cheaper.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.720]   But I'm not convinced that you should always go for cheaper.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:23.440]   I think that there is tremendous value with certain approaches to financial management.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.960]   I believe that there is value there.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:32.040]   So you've got to look and say, do I, as an individual investor, am I going to get enough
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:40.520]   value from this particular company here?
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:45.320]   Now I don't know whether these companies, with their algorithms and the automated management,
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:53.080]   et cetera, I don't know whether some of these companies can actually deliver on some of
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.380]   the tweaks that they're offering.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.980]   I simply don't know that.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.680]   But you've got to answer it subjectively.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.840]   You've got to look at it and say, do I get enough value out of this?
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   And here's the thing.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]   You're not stuck.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.680]   You can leave anytime you want.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:10.420]   So you're not going to be stuck in it.
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:11.720]   You're going to have options.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.320]   Any of them are fine as far as I'm concerned.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:20.360]   And yes, you should pick, especially now that you've had experience with those three, you
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:25.240]   should pick whichever one you like the most and aggregate your money there.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.640]   Any other questions, Ram, before I close out the Q&A call today?
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   That's all for today.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.640]   But I was expecting a nice podcast from you about when to go with the investment management
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:41.000]   firm, like when a fund reached 100K or 200K.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.480]   So that's the right time to go to a management company or whatever it is.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.320]   I mean, don't go.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.600]   At least due diligence.
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.520]   I think I was expecting some kind of podcast around that area.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.240]   I don't think you have in the past.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.920]   So I'm just giving my two cents.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.900]   Well, let me answer the question because it's a fair question.
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.080]   And I think I like to answer questions like that and take them head on.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:11.120]   I'll think about that in terms of could I design some useful approach.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.720]   But I frankly don't know if there is an answer to that.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.760]   I really don't.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:23.840]   Because I am deeply conflicted over this question of investment management.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:31.820]   And I'm deeply conflicted because the data and my experience in the business are actually
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.440]   in conflict.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:41.240]   So the data seems very, very clear in terms of choosing investment management.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:47.660]   The data seems clear that you want to deeply focus in on fees and expenses and lower fees
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.160]   and expenses as much as possible.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:56.280]   When you are simply measuring things like funds, like mutual funds, there is a very
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:06:02.020]   compelling academic case that you should just simply focus in deeply on fees.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.760]   And so in that case, I can't argue that.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:12.020]   I don't have any data that would say, well, this is definitely the wrong thing.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:20.640]   But there is, I'm convinced, a huge value that an investment manager provides for their
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:25.320]   clients and a personal financial advisor provides.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.520]   And I used to charge 100 to 150 basis points.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:35.640]   And small clients is up to 170 basis points of management fees on money when I used to
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.880]   manage money.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.400]   And I don't feel bad about that because I'm convinced I delivered in excess of that value.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:48.500]   I'm convinced I could deliver far in excess of 100 or 150 basis points of value.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.460]   But I couldn't necessarily prove it to you.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:53.780]   And so I try not to make statements of things that I can't prove.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.700]   But I try to demonstrate those things.
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:02.600]   And so the challenge is, how do I discriminate among advisors and advisory firms?
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.380]   Some financial advisory firms sell things they can't deliver on.
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.540]   They sell overperformance.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.260]   They sell outperformance in certain areas.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:15.060]   And I just don't see how some advisors can deliver what they sell.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.180]   However, there are other advisors who I think can deliver what they sell.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.660]   And so I don't know the answers.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:26.600]   We live in a time of historic change in the financial markets.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.260]   Investors are being pressed on fees in every which way.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.580]   And I think it's wonderful.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:36.380]   I love the impact that Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard, has had on the industry.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.900]   He has revolutionized the industry.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:47.660]   And the market has been running to Vanguard in ways in a historic way.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.620]   He has won.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.660]   And I love that because you see the power of the free market at work.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.060]   No government entity – I'll give a short political rant.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:59.340]   No government entity came in and said, "We're going to establish the fees.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.300]   If they did that, we would all be paying 400 basis points a year."
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:06.740]   It was competition where he came in, Bogle came in, and he said, "We're going to
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:07.740]   change this."
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:09.780]   And this is changing and revolutionizing the industry.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.820]   The major press of tech, Betterment, Wealthfront, personal capital, they're disrupting the
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.820]   industry.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.100]   And it's great.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.040]   But it's not everything.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.860]   And I guess the other thing – the other reason I'm kind of quiet on some of that
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:28.820]   subject is the farther away I have gotten from the world of money management, the more
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.940]   – hear me rightly – the more silly I think that world is.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:40.100]   It doesn't affect the average person nearly as much as good career decisions, nearly as
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.280]   much as good decisions on housing, on vehicles.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.640]   And I just – I really want to focus on the things that make the difference, not the kind
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.740]   of the minor things that may or may not make a difference for a tiny subset of the population.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.820]   So that's why I haven't focused on it.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:55.140]   Yes, I completely understand that, Joshua.
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:56.540]   I really like the answer.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:57.540]   I'm happy for it.
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.540]   I completely, 100 percent agree with you.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:01.540]   Awesome.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.100]   Well, Ram, thank you for calling in.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.460]   I'm really glad that you are here listening to the show.
[01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:07.460]   I love it.
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.060]   And it especially encourages me when you say, "I've listened to the other episodes,
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:14.700]   I've listened to past episodes, and I'm putting things into practice."
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.100]   And hey, man, you got 200 grand.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.460]   That puts you in the top – let me not get the decile wrong.
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:26.820]   That puts you in the top – probably the top quartile of the American population, which
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:30.260]   puts you in the top, what, 5 percent of the world probably with that amount of wealth?
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.260]   And you're just getting started.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.260]   I can hear it in your voice.
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.340]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.020]   One announcement as we go.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:43.420]   I love doing these Q&A shows and I've tried to keep them exclusively for patrons because
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.700]   – well, I've just found that to be a good way for me to moderate the number of callers.
[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.140]   So I've tried to do that, but I enjoy doing them.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:57.420]   And so what I've decided is next week, next week I've decided to do some Q&A shows.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.420]   Just one week.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.980]   I'm not doing it because I really want to keep this as a valuable benefit for the patrons.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:08.020]   I need the patrons to sign up and for you to sign up and again, allows me to moderate
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.020]   the number of people.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:12.940]   But if you're not a patron of the show and you'd like to call up and ask me any question,
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:17.180]   financial planning question, a personal question, anything you want, I'd love to do that.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:22.620]   So next week I am going to open up the phone lines and I am going to do – at the moment
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:28.820]   I'm planning to do at least four, maybe five shows with details on where you can call
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.780]   in and it'll be a live show just like the one that you have just heard.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.020]   And this will be open publicly, publicly available.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.960]   So I'm going to publish in the show notes for today's show, I will publish a link
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.260]   with information with the time and the phone number for you to call in.
