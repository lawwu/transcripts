[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Over the past year, I've released over 60 episodes
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   of this show packed with strategies
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.200]   to help you upgrade your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.280]   And today I'm distilling all of that
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.240]   into 10 powerful takeaways,
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.000]   the most impactful insights
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.880]   from all the research I've done myself
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.120]   and the conversations I've had
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.720]   with incredible guests in 2024.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.360]   Whether you're looking to invest smarter,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   save more, master award travel,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.800]   level up your credit cards,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.440]   or build habits that stick,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.560]   these takeaways will give you actionable ways
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.160]   to make 2025 your best year yet.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   I'm Chris Hutchins.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.280]   If you enjoy this, please share it with a friend
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.800]   or leave a comment or review.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.600]   And if you wanna keep upgrading your life,

[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.680]   Okay, so the first three takeaways are in money.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.600]   And number one is that there is no one right way to invest.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.280]   Investing is so personal
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.200]   and the right strategy depends on your situation,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400]   your risk tolerance, your long-term objectives,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.480]   and a lot more.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.320]   And so in episode 199,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.760]   I sat down with Tad Fallows
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.000]   who started this group called Long Angle,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.760]   which is a private network for high net worth investors.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.280]   You should definitely check it out, longangle.com.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.440]   And I got to attend their summit
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.720]   where we talked about the 10 lessons
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.320]   we took away from the conference.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.720]   And it was so interesting
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.840]   that despite that there were so many people,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960]   so smart, focused on investing,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.320]   there was no one right answer.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.560]   And even in the sessions
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.640]   where different types of alternative investments
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.240]   were being presented and shared,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.720]   there was no perfect answer between those either.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.800]   And it wasn't just that diversification was the only answer,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   it depended on how important liquidity was to you,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.480]   how much risk you wanted to take on,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.040]   how interested you were in exploring the topic
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.440]   because some types of investments
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.160]   take a lot of time and energy and education.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.680]   So that was one really big takeaway for me
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.720]   because I think I've always been hearing,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600]   oh, real estate's amazing, let's chase that.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.000]   Oh, this is awesome, private credit, angel investing.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.480]   And you could chase that strategy
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   of trying to find the best thing,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.840]   but the reality is everyone is different,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240]   everyone has different ideas.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.000]   This takeaway also showed up in episode 186 a lot
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.720]   when I talked to Brian Feraldi about 25 money rules
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.040]   and when to break them.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.720]   Because despite that there are some great rules of thumb
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.920]   that help you think about personal finance and investing,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.960]   like you could take the rule of 110,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.880]   where you subtract your age from 110,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.120]   and that's a rough percentage
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.640]   of how much you should keep your portfolio in stocks.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   But that really depends on who you are.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.920]   And in episode 189 with Karsten,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.960]   we talked about the 4% rule
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600]   and how yes, it's a great rule of thumb
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.880]   for how much you need to retire early.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.760]   There are so many factors and variables
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.040]   where for you it might be the 3% rule or the 5% rule.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.240]   We also talked about how the percentage of your portfolio
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120]   that you want in stocks as you retire
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.160]   might be really dependent on the market situation
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.120]   at your retirement.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.880]   And going back a little bit further than 2024
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   to episode 19 with my former boss and mentor, Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.600]   we talked about becoming a better investor.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.280]   And he is not really a fan of a lot of speculative
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.200]   investments, picking stocks, investing in crypto,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.080]   but he said, "Look, if you have to allocate 10%
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.320]   "of your portfolio to that,"
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.000]   which showed up in the Brian Feraldi episode
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.120]   as the 10% rule,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.640]   that's okay if it allows you to kind of stick
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.320]   to the portfolio you want with the other 90%.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320]   And so these rules can be helpful as guidelines,
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.040]   but they really aren't definitive.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.880]   And most of them have caveats.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.360]   But if there is one right way to invest,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.320]   and I know the takeaway is that there isn't,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.400]   it's the way that you can stick with.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.160]   The key here is consistency.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.000]   If you can find a strategy that you can stick with
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   for the long run that you're excited about,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.360]   then maybe that is the right way,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.800]   but that doesn't mean it's the right way for someone else.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.120]   And when it comes to something you can stick with,
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.720]   simplicity can often be a lot better than complexity.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.840]   And overthinking your investment decisions
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.280]   can lead you to this analysis paralysis,
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   which I think we've all been in some way, shape or form.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.800]   And so finding that perfect investment can be really tough.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.400]   We talked about this in episode 191 with Ben Carlson,
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.880]   when we talked about 11 lessons
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   that every investor needs to know,
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.280]   and thinking about simplicity.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.840]   And then I sat down with my old co-founder, Chris Doyle,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.960]   in episode 168,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.240]   talking about building an investment portfolio.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.400]   And we talked about how you personalize your portfolio.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.840]   We went really tactical on how to do that.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   But at the end of the day, it was like,
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.800]   is 65, 35, 70, 30, 68, 72, which one's right?
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   The answer is, if it's gonna delay your time
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.480]   trying to pick a number,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.080]   then any number is fine,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.320]   because there's that old adage of time in the market
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.600]   is better than timing the market.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.280]   Well, time in the market is also better
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.360]   than sitting on the sidelines for years
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.680]   because you can't pick the perfect thing.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.120]   The actual tracking error
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.760]   between a 68 and a 69% stock portfolio
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.080]   is probably very minimal,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.560]   and won't really affect the long-term outcome.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.720]   And if it would, who knows which one would have been better.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   So the big takeaway here
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.040]   is that there's no one size fits all approach for everyone
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   when it comes to investing.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.480]   And what works for someone else,
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.280]   who by the way, might have a different net worth,
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.360]   savings rate, level of investment experience,
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.720]   risk tolerance, it might not be right for you.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   And so take the time to figure out what suits you best,
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.680]   and then try to find a simple version of it
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.480]   that you can stick with for the long run.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.080]   Takeaway number two is that deals can be a side hustle.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.360]   And this one really was wild
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.480]   because I'd always thought about side hustles
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.880]   and building a business,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.760]   like we discussed in episode 154 with Noah Kagan
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.200]   about building a company.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.800]   You know, I've always been in the tech world,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.280]   starting companies and raising money and that kind of stuff.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.680]   It never really crossed my mind that a side hustle
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.560]   could actually be something different than a business
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.880]   in the traditional sense.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.240]   So in episode 181, I sat down with Kai
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.680]   from the Daily Churn podcast,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.200]   and we did an episode about making $3,000 a month
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.280]   from online deals.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.040]   And it totally changed my mind,
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.120]   sent me down a hundred different rabbit holes
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.560]   that I'm not even gonna go to right now.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.640]   But it just really opened my eyes
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080]   that a side hustle doesn't have to be a business.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.560]   It could just be anything that generates extra money
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.080]   or reduces your costs.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.240]   And so whether that's opening up a bonus
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.640]   with a bank account, a credit card,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.080]   and in episode 177,
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.680]   we went really deep on bank account and brokerage bonuses,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.200]   whether that's finding a way to get deals on meal kits
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.600]   to reduce your grocery costs,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.760]   whether that's finding cell phone deals
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.240]   to reduce your cell phone bill,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   whether that's doing things like buying groups or gift cards
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   or buying and selling gold,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.160]   which is something that I did an episode on 206
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.440]   with Trey from Pure.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.000]   And so all of these different things
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.160]   can be a side hustle that can generate a lot of income.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.200]   And from listening to Kai's podcast and a few others,
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.240]   it's incredible how much money can be generated
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.520]   in the form of savings, offers, deals, points.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.720]   And I think Kai doing this 10, 15 hours a week
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.000]   is generating well over 30 to $40,000 a year.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   I explored a few of them again in episode 184,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.720]   we did five tactics to save $50,000 a year.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.360]   And I just really love this concept
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.680]   and it's really opened my eyes
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.000]   and in some ways it's taken over a lot more free time
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   than maybe it should.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   And so each week if I find something new that's exciting,
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.040]   whether it's an opportunity or a deal,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.480]   I'll put it in the newsletter
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   'cause it doesn't always make the podcast
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.040]   given how much easier it is
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.520]   to slot something in at the last minute.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.360]   So if you're not subscribed, allthehacks.com/email,
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.200]   perfect way to find some of these cool deals
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.600]   as they come up.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   But the big takeaway here
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.360]   is that anything that generates income
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.600]   or reduces your spending
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.200]   is effectively a business or a side hustle.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.440]   So in 2025, take a fresh look at your spending.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.400]   I know Amy and I just ran through all our expenses
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   and co-pilot, we've got a nice summary for the year
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.560]   and find a few creative ways
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.600]   that you can save or earn extra cash
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.840]   because these deals,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.000]   no matter how small they might seem individually
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680]   can really add up to huge wins over time
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.200]   when you do a lot of them together.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.440]   This episode is brought to you by Delete.me.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.760]   And if you prefer not to have your identity stolen
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.940]   or have your phone number, home address or email
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.400]   showing up all over the internet,
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.880]   you really need to check out Delete.me this year.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.480]   Unfortunately, there's hundreds of data brokers online
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.600]   that are constantly sharing and selling your personal info
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.680]   and keeping track of all of them is like playing whack-a-mole
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   but fortunately, if you go to them one by one,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.800]   you can get them to remove your data.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.320]   However, that process can take hours and hours
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.400]   to do yourself.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.760]   I know I tried it two years ago
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.000]   and after spending more than 10 hours
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.080]   and not even getting close to finishing,
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.120]   I gave up and started using Delete.me
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.640]   and I haven't looked back.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.040]   Since then, I've signed up my entire family
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.600]   because Delete.me will not just find
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.120]   and remove your personal info
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.200]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.440]   they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.480]   which sadly happens all the time
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   and get that removed as well.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.400]   On average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.480]   of personal info for a customer in their first two years
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.040]   and to date, they've done over a hundred million
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.020]   data removals for customers.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.760]   So if you want your personal information
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.920]   removed from the web,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.520]   go to chrishutchins.com/deleteme
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.200]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.040]   Again, that's chrishutchins.com/deleteme

[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   This episode is brought to you by Stable,
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.640]   which is a company that has really made my life better
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.160]   this year and that's because Stable provides you
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160]   or your business with a mailing address
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.840]   you can send everything to
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.040]   and they scan the mail, forward packages,
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.760]   deposit checks and more.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   It's really a full dashboard to manage
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.460]   all your physical mail online
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.520]   and thousands of companies from Formation
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.600]   all the way to Fortune 500 use Stable
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.080]   to automate their mail room
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.960]   and act as their permanent business address
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.640]   with the IRS, state and any vendor.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.460]   I also love it because you all know
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.360]   I care a lot about privacy.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.860]   So I actually prefer not to share my personal info
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.160]   with every app or service that asks for a mailing address.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.160]   So Stable has been incredible for that.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.880]   Stable is so easy to use for you or your team
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.720]   and it'll let you manage your mail from anywhere
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.220]   with a digital mailbox and best of all,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.920]   you can get 50% off your first 12 months
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.440]   at chrishutchins.com/stable.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.960]   That's 50% off your new digital mailbox
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.400]   at chrishutchins.com/stable
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.800]   or the link in the description.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.980]   Okay, the next three takeaways are in travel
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.460]   and number three is moving past checklist travel.
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.000]   And this one got really highlighted in episode 42
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.180]   with Lee Rowan, who's been a guest on this podcast a lot.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.600]   He's a good friend of mine
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.240]   and we talked about how optimizing a travel experience
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.520]   or a trip doesn't mean you have to over plan
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.960]   and check all the boxes
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.160]   and how important it is to leave room for flexibility.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.040]   This is so much more true with kids
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.760]   as I've seen the past few years.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.040]   And so we actually went through three rules of thumb
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.600]   for creating an itinerary.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.960]   First is just kind of managing expectations
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.520]   and trying not to overload.
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.560]   Second is to build a framework for the trip,
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.080]   maybe set up your scaffolding of a hotel and a flights
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.280]   and some key activities.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.720]   And then three is to kind of visualize and adjust things.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.960]   So map it out, use paper, do it digitally.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.640]   We like to do ours in Notion
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.560]   and I share that with Amy, we kind of collaborate
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.280]   but organize everything together,
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.400]   whether you put it on a spreadsheet or a calendar
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   and really just try to understand what's there,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.040]   leaving space and looking for balance.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.800]   And another interesting point came out of this
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.200]   and that was from Harry Mitsidis,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.560]   the world's most traveled man.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.520]   I think he's been to every country in the world twice.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.200]   We talked about in episode 179,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.560]   how your second and third trip to a destination
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.040]   is always better than the first
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.400]   because you get to experience
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   and understand a place a bit deeper.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.120]   And as much as I'm always thinking,
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.680]   oh, I would love to travel to a new place,
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   I wanna see something new.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.000]   That is an exciting part of travel,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.320]   but there are a few countries like Japan and France
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.080]   where we've gone back over and over again.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   I can't explain how awesome it is
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.920]   to go back to see a place
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.600]   where you don't feel the pressure
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.720]   of needing to check off all these options
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.040]   of places that you have to see,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.400]   these must-see destinations.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.800]   And you can just really immerse yourself in the place,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.720]   get lost roaming the streets,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.400]   stop for a meal that you weren't planning on.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   It just makes every trip awesome.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.560]   And I think the exciting thing is
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.280]   I'm starting to reframe my mind
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.800]   that you can just do that anywhere.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.040]   It's okay to go to a country
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.560]   and not see all the marquee destinations.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.120]   You can always go back.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.600]   I was listening to an episode of the Frequent Miler podcast
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   where one of the hosts was talking about
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.920]   going to Australia or New Zealand
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   and how they only had a week
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.400]   and they thought it needed two.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.800]   And they ended up deciding to take the trip anyways,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   even though it wasn't enough time
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.160]   to do all the things they wanted
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.680]   because they had this idea of if we love it so much
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.520]   and we need to see the other things, we can go back.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   And that trip was a giant unlock
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.160]   for all travel for their family
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.000]   because it opened their eyes to this concept
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.040]   of you don't need to wait
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.400]   until you have enough time to do all the things
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.880]   because you can always go back.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.080]   And one other thing that I think really highlighted this
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.480]   was when we took our group trip to Iceland this year.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.720]   So for anyone who doesn't know,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   we planned an All The Hacks Iceland trip.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.800]   You can actually go on the trip this year in 2025.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.680]   There are a few spaces left.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.640]   If you go to allthehacks.com/iceland,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.000]   you can learn a lot more.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.800]   But we went on this trip
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   and every single person was absolutely amazed.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.680]   I think we got 100% five-star reviews.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.040]   You can see some of the testimonials in the trailer
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.760]   on the page I just mentioned.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.120]   But what was amazing is that everyone that went
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.360]   is a listener, they're a watcher,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.680]   they're part of this community,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.800]   and they're used to planning everything.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.120]   But for this trip, they didn't plan anything.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.720]   We planned the trip for them
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.080]   and it was so incredible to see people
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.000]   just get to enjoy something
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.080]   and not feel the stress of trying to make sure
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.480]   they got to see all the things.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.560]   And so it was just really awesome.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.240]   So whether you hire a guide,
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.880]   whether you just give up on needing to see everything,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.680]   or whether you join us on this trip in Iceland this year,
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.040]   there are a lot of different ways to embody
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.960]   this type of travel that isn't just all about
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.440]   checking off all the boxes.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.200]   So if you have big plans this year,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.080]   try to make it more about creating meaningful,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.440]   enjoyable experiences, maybe at a slower pace than normal,
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.880]   whether it's a weekend getaway or a big trip abroad.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.640]   Okay, takeaway number four,
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.560]   award travel is still the best deal in travel.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.400]   So I have countless experiences myself,
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.240]   including the summer trip to Europe,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.000]   where we saved over $20,000
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.040]   booking things with points and miles,
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.640]   primarily at a hotel that's incredible called Caprocot,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.880]   where we use Hilton points.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.200]   We used Hyatt points at the Paris Madeleine Hotel.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.480]   And then we got an incredible deal
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.120]   on business class flights in United and Air France.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.280]   We actually documented how we did all of that in episode 192.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.600]   And so I still think that the best way to travel
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.120]   is to use points and miles.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.200]   And if you're just a little bit flexible,
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.080]   you unlock this outsized massive return.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.280]   And we talked all about it in episode 175
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.880]   with Nick from The Frequent Miler
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.760]   about how to get the most value.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.400]   And flexibility doesn't have to mean just one thing
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.600]   that you're not flexible in.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.520]   So a lot of times people say,
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.580]   "Well, I'm not flexible on dates."
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.440]   Well, maybe you're flexible with where you go.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.300]   Maybe you're flexible with how far out
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.040]   or how close to leaving you book.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.640]   Maybe you're flexible with how many stops.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.780]   There are a lot of different ways to be flexible
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.980]   and you don't have to be flexible on all of them
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.200]   to get a great deal.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.760]   And so I think this actually has gotten even easier
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.640]   and better in 2024 and hopefully 2025,
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.960]   it just keeps getting better
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.320]   because there are so many incredible tools
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.600]   that we didn't have three, four years ago
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.120]   for doing all of these searches for award flights.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.520]   So it's never been easier.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.960]   In episode 166 and 167 with Greg from The Frequent Miler,
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.920]   we actually went through all the flight search tools
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.160]   and the hotel search tools.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.380]   And we even talked about award booking services.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.920]   If you don't wanna do all this yourself,
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.600]   you can just hire companies for 100 to $200 a passenger
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.360]   and they'll just do all the searching for you.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.920]   And if they're able to take points
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.960]   that you would have otherwise used for a $5,000 flight
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.040]   and get you a $20,000 flight,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.200]   well then yeah, it's probably worth that $200 cost
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.880]   if you weren't gonna do it yourself otherwise.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.960]   And so if you have just a little flexibility,
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.600]   the big takeaway is that using points and miles
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.720]   to book flights and hotels is really the best deal on travel.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.320]   And I hope you get to put that to use
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   for some amazing trips this year in 2025.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.040]   I know we absolutely will.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.360]   Takeaway number five, cashback can be better than points.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.720]   Now, this might seem completely contradictory
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.160]   to what I just said about award travel.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.280]   But 2024 was the year that I really processed and understood
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.760]   that you can disassociate earning points
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.400]   from redeeming points
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.860]   because points are constantly on sale.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.360]   So you could completely focus on cashback
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.920]   and then use the cashback you earned to buy points.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.160]   So I talked a lot about this in episode 170
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.580]   where I talked about cashback versus points.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.400]   And I did a little bit of analysis
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.160]   for this episode right now
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.080]   where I looked at some of the most popular transfer partners
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.720]   where I'm often taking my points from banks
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.520]   and transferring them to airlines or hotel groups.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.640]   And so Aeroplan, Hyatt, Alaska, Avianca, Air France,
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.320]   they're all ones that I've used in the recent past.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.040]   And I looked at how often those points went on sale.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.560]   And for that set of just five,
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.100]   and there are lots of other hotels and airlines
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.720]   that have points that go on sale,
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.880]   there were eight, four, eight, 12, and six sales
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.000]   across all of them accordingly,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.400]   which means anywhere from once a quarter to once a month,
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.920]   these points are going on sale.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.320]   And they go on sale for anywhere from a low price of 1.07
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.600]   or 1.1 cents on Aeroplan and Avianca.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.040]   In the middle, you've got Air France,
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.320]   which on sale is 1.53 cents.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.600]   And then on the higher end, Alaska and Hyatt
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.160]   went on sale for 1.74 and 1.92 cents.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.480]   So anywhere from one to two cents,
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.900]   you can get most point currencies on sale.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.480]   Now, if you're not getting them on sale,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.160]   usually it's anywhere from two to three cents.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.700]   But that means that if you take a card
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.640]   like the new US Bank Smartly card that earns 4%,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.020]   as long as you have $100,000 parked at some account there,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.680]   stocks or cash,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.240]   you could effectively kind of roll
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.200]   your own transfer partners by taking the cash back
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.480]   and buying points on sale.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.920]   Or you could buy points not on sale
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.440]   and then compare the points being on sale
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.480]   to the kind of equivalent of transfer bonuses.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.560]   And kind of, it's a fun comparison,
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.200]   which I'm actually gonna do an entire episode on this
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.280]   because I went through and priced out
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.160]   all the sales from last year.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.960]   I looked at all the transfer bonuses.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.800]   And so I've got a lot of interesting things to share.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.140]   But just high level,
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.000]   if you're comparing a card that earns 1.5 or 2X points,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.180]   you know, the venture card,
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.080]   or there's a lot of cards out there that are in that range.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.840]   You're kind of everything else card.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.580]   And you compare that to a card that earns 4% back,
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.740]   you could have your pick of pretty much every point
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.240]   I just mentioned when it's on sale.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.080]   Because if points cost anywhere from one to two cents,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.120]   and you've got four cents to play with,
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.920]   you can get two to four points for every four cents you earn.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.920]   And so you're actually coming out way ahead.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.760]   On top of that,
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.560]   let's say there isn't any award availability
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.960]   and you have to just buy your ticket.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.220]   I know for those of us with a big pile of points,
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:00.760]   sometimes it can feel stressful to think,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.160]   gosh, I have all these points accumulated
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.480]   and I've got to buy this ticket.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.520]   What are these points for?
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.640]   That's a great argument for cash back
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.640]   and using that cash to buy points.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.220]   Doesn't come with some cons,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.320]   which is that travel just doesn't feel free.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.600]   Like it actually, to me,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.000]   when you earn these points that aren't denominated in
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.160]   dollars and you can't convert it easily,
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.080]   it makes travel feel free and that's awesome.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   Even though I know there's this opportunity cost,
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.760]   it just doesn't feel as free.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.160]   And then the other challenge is,
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   you have to buy these points when they're on sale
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.720]   for this to be an incredible deal.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.040]   Although it's not the worst deal
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.320]   if you don't buy them on sale
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.880]   and that'll break all that down.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.240]   And so this is something that I just went really deep on
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   and it's kind of changing my mentality
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.640]   on how I want to use my cards.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.040]   And sometimes I'm getting a better ROI using a points card.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.440]   Sometimes it's cash back.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.460]   But if you'd asked me in 2023,
[00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.440]   whether I'd be spending a ton of money
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.320]   on cash back cards in 2024,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.720]   I would have told you you were crazy.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.120]   And that's really been a big shift for me.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.280]   I actually built this tool
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.440]   at allthehacks.com/cardtool,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.960]   where I spent, I don't know, 20, 30 hours
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.900]   building out a model in Google Sheets
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.880]   to be able to optimize all your card usage.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.520]   So check that out if you're interested.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.840]   But the big takeaway is that this year,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.920]   I want you to consider whether cash back is a better fit
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.080]   for some areas of your spending.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.600]   And I know for me,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.760]   anytime I'm able to get 4% or more cash back,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.780]   I kind of lean that direction.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.680]   But if I'm gonna earn 1% or 2% cash back,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.920]   absolutely, I'm almost always going for points.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.560]   So it's a little bit of a balance.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.120]   If you're working on a welcome bonus,
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   it's probably gonna blow any cash back rate
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.200]   out of the water.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   But it's just something
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.440]   that I've really been starting to think more about,
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.480]   especially as I see all these points go on sale.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.080]   This episode is brought to you by Superhuman.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.760]   Now I've used Superhuman for years,
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.660]   and I think it's hands down the best way to do email,
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.520]   assuming you value your time,
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.620]   which I absolutely assume you do.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.600]   That's because Superhuman is the ultimate solution
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.620]   for inbox decluttering and enhanced productivity.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.760]   It's also the fastest email experience out there,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.300]   and I'm certain I've saved dozens,
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.680]   if not hundreds of hours a year using Superhuman.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.920]   They have every feature you could ever want built in,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.480]   split inboxes for prioritizing what matters,
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.520]   keyboard shortcuts and snippets for everything,
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.480]   AI tools to draft responses and summarize emails,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.080]   automated reminders and integrated calendars.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.680]   And if you're using Superhuman for Teams,
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.940]   you get shared conversations and drafts
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.720]   that will help you respond faster and reduce deal cycles.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.080]   Best of all, Superhuman works
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.480]   with your existing Gmail or Outlook.

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.280]   you have to check out Superhuman,
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.720]   and every one of you can get your first month free

[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.200]   This episode is brought to you by Element.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.760]   Now, I love Element, and I use it all the time
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.080]   because it helps anyone stay hydrated
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.720]   without the sugar and other dodgy ingredients
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.280]   in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   And that's important
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.300]   because electrolyte deficiency or imbalance
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.240]   can cause headaches, cramps, fatigue,
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.080]   brain fog, and weakness.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.400]   In fact, Element is a zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.580]   and sparkling electrolyte water
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.640]   born from the growing body of research
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.480]   revealing that optimal health outcomes
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.760]   occur at sodium levels
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.440]   two to three times government recommendations.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.340]   Element is formulated for anyone
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.080]   on a mission to restore their health through hydration,
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.880]   and it's perfectly suited for everyone from athletes
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.720]   to regular people like me,
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.840]   and works if you're fasting on a keto,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.800]   low-carb, or paleo diet.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.040]   And if you're not sure if it's for you, don't worry,
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.180]   because Element offers a no-questions-asked refund policy
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.280]   so you can try it totally risk-free.

[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.880]   Okay, the last set of takeaways
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.040]   really spread all areas of life.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.320]   And number six is a big one for me,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.180]   which is spend time with the right people
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.400]   in the right way.
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.260]   And as we discussed last week in the annual review episode,
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.300]   we talked about people that are boat anchors in your life
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.140]   and bring you down,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.920]   and it just really highlights how important it is
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.520]   to spend time with the right people.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.960]   Time is such a limited resource.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.680]   Sahil had this great blog post
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.080]   where he showed all these charts
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.200]   about how we spend time and how that changes.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.720]   And if you look at the time you spend with family,
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.040]   by the time you hit your mid-20s, that's kind of gone.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.880]   If you look at time you spend with friends,
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.420]   surprisingly, it also diminishes usually as you have kids.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.500]   Time with your partner is actually relatively consistent,
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.020]   but your time with children chart
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.380]   was the really interesting one,
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.140]   where it peaks for most people in their mid to late 30s,
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.700]   and then it kind of falls off a cliff.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.380]   And the amount of time you spend with your kids
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.420]   really goes down, which makes sense.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.860]   You know, we probably can all imagine
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.700]   how much less time we spent with our parents
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.540]   as we went to college, as we moved out on our own,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:53.540]   but it really just got me thinking about how to spend time
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.880]   and making sure it's with the people you want,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.400]   people that bring your spirits up,
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.280]   people that don't drag you down.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.540]   And that just became a big priority for me,
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.040]   being intentional with time and who we spend it with.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.880]   So the summary is to be mindful
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.560]   of who you spend your time with this year
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.080]   and prioritize relationships that energize you
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.280]   and distance yourself from negativity.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.720]   And how do you have time for that
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.160]   is where our next takeaway, number seven, comes in,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.120]   which is you can make time in your life.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.040]   And there are lots of different ways to do this.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.580]   I actually had a whole episode with John and Jake,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.000]   number 185, they actually have a four-step framework
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   how to do this that's in that episode.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.740]   Another amazing way to do it is to buy time
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.680]   through delegation and outsourcing.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.200]   And so if you go way back to episode 98,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.680]   which technically wasn't last year,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.040]   I talked to Dan Martell about buying back your time.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.280]   But then last year, I did talk to Sam Korkos
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.080]   about scaling yourself through delegation,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.920]   assistance, and automation.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.680]   And that was just such an impactful conversation
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.400]   that really helped me level up
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.780]   the way we think about outsourcing in our lives.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.720]   And so I think a lot of people here know that we use Oceans
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   and that's how I found our incredible team member, Pasany,
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.280]   who has added so much value to work and life.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.040]   I actually wrote a whole guide to delegation.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.560]   I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.960]   And if you're interested in Oceans,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.600]   there's also a deal in that guide and in the show notes.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.000]   Another option here is a company called Faye, findfaye.com.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.120]   And I don't have any affiliation
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.160]   other than I tried to hire one of the co-founders
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.920]   a long time ago, but they basically pair you up
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.560]   with a part-time family advisor who takes your to-do lists
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.940]   and all the projects and tasks you have and takes them off.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.180]   So it's like a part-time virtual assistant
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.620]   focused on families.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.820]   And with all these AI and language model tools coming out,
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.860]   I think it's gonna be even easier and even cheaper
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.580]   to delegate and outsource so many different projects
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.140]   and tasks in the future, whether they're research-based,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.700]   they're work-based, they're errand-based.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.140]   One little simple thing that I think isn't used
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.620]   as much as I thought was just using Uber for deliveries.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.140]   And so I remember there was a restaurant
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.840]   we really wanted to order food from
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.760]   and it was only available for pickup.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.040]   And I looked and sure enough, you could order it for pickup
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.720]   and then order an Uber to go pick it up.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   And the cost of that Uber was like 12 or $13,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.160]   but the restaurant was like 20 minutes away.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.400]   So from a value of your time perspective,
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.000]   if you have to drive to that restaurant and back,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.360]   it was a great deal,
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.600]   even if you factor in whatever tip you're offering.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.840]   And so I just encourage people to think about their time
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.960]   and find ways to spend it more intentionally.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.600]   But also when you're in the middle of that time,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.680]   when you've found the right people,
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.480]   when you've made time for them,
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.520]   I think a really important thing is also use that time
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.260]   to be present, reduce the distractions.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.580]   Talked about that with Nate Klemp,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.700]   talked about that with Sahil,
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.300]   talked about that with Dr. Aditi,
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.680]   and really use that time
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.580]   to have more meaningful interactions.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.160]   If it's at work, maybe you wanna have interactions
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.300]   that embrace the spirit of radical candor,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   which we talked about in episode 169.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.860]   And so the takeaway is to take the time that you've made
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.140]   and then go spend it with the people you care about it
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.320]   and really be present and enjoy that time
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.780]   and make the most of it and build
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.780]   more meaningful relationships with those people.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.580]   Okay, takeaway number eight is that prioritizing your health
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.180]   is easier than you think.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.020]   And in the last takeaway,
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.780]   we talked about how to make time in your day,
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.860]   but if you wanna take a longer term approach to making time,
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.580]   it would just be to live longer, increase your longevity.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.880]   And I'm increasingly finding my health
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.480]   to be one of the most important things
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.500]   to spend the time I have on.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.980]   And so it's no surprise, we did an episode on sleep,
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.260]   on longevity, on breathing,
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.780]   on metabolic health and on nutrition.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.680]   And one of the common recurring themes
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:17.880]   across all of these episodes was three foundations,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.960]   sleep, food, and exercise.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.360]   And I'm not gonna go through all three of them,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.200]   but I just wanna share how good it feels
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   to really start taking these things more seriously.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.280]   Any one of them you can tackle,
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.040]   whichever one is the most important to you.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.080]   And if you wanna get started,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.880]   one way to start thinking about health
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.080]   is maybe just do some diagnostics,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.840]   whether that's a blood panel, whether that's a DEXA scan,
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:39.720]   whether it's checking your VO2 max,
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.060]   figure out which area of your health
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.660]   you wanna have the biggest impact on
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.620]   and start there.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.800]   And once you've identified that thing
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.320]   that matters the most, you can go deeper.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.600]   You could do a lot more extensive blood panel.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.480]   You can work with a doctor specifically on those things.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.640]   And so last year for me, it was all about cholesterol
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.800]   and really dialing those numbers in
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.080]   to a point where right now,
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.320]   I don't feel like I'm gonna have to worry
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.520]   about heart disease.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.580]   And it's not really gonna be an issue for me
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.120]   for the rest of my life because I have it under control.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.880]   And Amy, I know she feels incredible right now
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.820]   that she took this huge step
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.320]   of doing a preventative double mastectomy
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.340]   after learning she carried the BRCA2 gene.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.840]   And I actually shared a lot more detail
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.520]   about that process in episode 175
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.400]   because it was a major surgery,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.280]   but I'm so proud of her for doing it.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.680]   And I know she feels so great about her health.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.700]   And so the takeaway,
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.600]   your health is your foundation for everything else.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.040]   Take inventory, address whatever matters the most for you.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.000]   It's amazing how little simple things,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.800]   whether it's diet to the way you breathe
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.040]   can actually have really big impacts on your health.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.160]   All right, takeaway number nine
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.440]   is that the key to good communication is listening.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   And this one's hard for me,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.120]   and it's really counterintuitive.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.360]   And you'd think that if you wanna be the best communicator,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.380]   you really need to learn to speak better.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.200]   But it seems every person I talk to
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.920]   has told me that's wrong.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.600]   I had a great conversation with Charles Duhigg
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   in episode 159 about becoming a super communicator.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.840]   And he effectively said that effective communication
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.760]   all starts with good listening.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.440]   And while it wasn't last year,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.280]   I go back to a really early episode,
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.080]   number 17 with Kwame Christian about negotiating.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.640]   And I remember how we talked about then
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.620]   how important it is to listen as part of negotiating.
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.500]   But I think I was thinking about it too narrowly back then.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.120]   It was like, oh, it's just about negotiating,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.240]   but it's really about all types of communication.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.200]   We even talked about in episode 162,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.840]   Dan Pink came on to talk about persuasion.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.160]   And he talked about how listening
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.760]   can be a really persuasive tool.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.060]   Talk less, listen more.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.600]   It's just something that I'm always working on
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.000]   and trying to do better.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.120]   And this also made me think about the conversation I had
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.880]   with my mentor, Andy Ratcliffe.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.700]   It was in episode 174.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.360]   But he highlighted that one of the things
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.280]   he looks for in people is a learn-it-all mindset
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.680]   instead of a know-it-all mindset.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.280]   And he's said that in meetings and conversations,
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.360]   he always sees people getting drawn
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.280]   towards people who absorb more
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.080]   and don't dominate conversations.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.360]   And so I think applying this takeaway,
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.720]   this idea of listening more throughout your life in 2025
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.640]   will pay so many dividends.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.880]   And one of the things that's actually helped me
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.760]   think about being a better listener in the coming year
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.360]   is these three levels of listening
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.100]   that we talked about in episode 190.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.180]   You go from me listening to you listening to us listening
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.700]   and the impact kind of being aware
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.580]   of those types of listening can have.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.700]   And one fun tip for trying to get better at this
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.420]   is when you're sitting in a conversation with anyone,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.380]   ask open-ended questions
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.060]   to really foster a deep connection
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.980]   and give yourself an opportunity to listen better.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.620]   Ask someone a question about their childhood,
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.700]   about an experience they have, a place they've been,
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.520]   where they can spend a lot of time answering,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.220]   usually on a topic they're excited about.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.420]   And so in the year ahead,
[00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.560]   try to practice really active listening
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.820]   in all of your conversations,
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.020]   whether it's with partners, kids, co-workers,
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.300]   or even strangers, and see how it impacts your relationships.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.320]   Okay, final takeaway, number 10,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.460]   building good habits takes time,
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.120]   but it's absolutely worth it.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.140]   And one of the most important habits I built last year
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.300]   was waking up early.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.220]   And I've never really been a morning person.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.420]   I've always been a little bit more of a stay up late
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.380]   and get stuff done.
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.260]   And I was able to create this uninterrupted time
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.460]   in my schedule, anywhere from one to two hours,
[00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.660]   depending on when I woke up, when the kids woke up.
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.060]   And I've used that time for exercise, for work,
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.620]   for cold plunges, and a lot more, and it feels easy now.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.060]   And the trick for me was that it wasn't about
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.860]   when I woke up, it was about when I went to bed.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.180]   And so I made my habit at night.
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.980]   So in episode 159, Charles Duhigg,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.240]   who kind of wrote the book about habits,
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.740]   talked about this three-stage cycle
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:26.680]   and how you can repeat it to really build new behavior.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.400]   So you start with a cue and the signal
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.820]   that triggers your brain to act,
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.620]   and you look at the automatic action
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:34.020]   and how the behavior comes from the cue,
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.300]   and then think of a reward
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.340]   to reinforce the behavior you want.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.860]   And so as silly as this sounds, for Amy and I,
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.380]   we had this reward that I didn't even realize was happening,
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.940]   which was as soon as we got to bed,
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.620]   we'd watch a show for half an hour before we go to sleep.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.220]   And to everyone who says that's not the best path for sleep,
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.300]   yes, I get it, but it's what happened.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.700]   And it really worked well for this habit
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.880]   because that was our reward.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.980]   So the cue was that our girls fell asleep
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.060]   and the automatic action was, okay, girls are asleep,
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.980]   let's get in bed.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.860]   And the reward was we got to watch a show together
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:04.740]   and that was really fun.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.060]   And so we did that.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.300]   And now we're regularly and consistently waking up
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.340]   anywhere from five to six in the morning.
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.420]   And we have a lot of time on our hands
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.260]   in that morning window that we use way more productively
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.740]   than the extra one or two hours
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.780]   we were using at night before.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.300]   And so a few tactics to support this.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.820]   What I really like is just focus on keystone habits
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.400]   that can create this kind of chain reaction
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   of other behaviors.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.860]   So for example, waking up early
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.940]   might create this chain reaction that you go exercise.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.020]   In fact, exercise can be a keystone habit
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.900]   that might inspire healthier eating or more confidence,
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.900]   which can affect your work or your life, your relationships.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.140]   So that keystone habit idea is really great.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.300]   And because habits like this take time,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.220]   I would encourage you to try something
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.740]   that Sahil Bloom suggested,
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.500]   which is this 30 for 30 approach,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.060]   which is commit for 30 days
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.820]   and 30 minutes for those 30 consecutive days
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.460]   and see what happens after that.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.600]   For me, once I've done something for about a month,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.880]   it no longer feels as hard as it did in the first place.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.320]   So the takeaway, building good habits
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.520]   can be challenging at first,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.060]   but the results are totally worth it.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.600]   So start small, focus on keystone habits
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.880]   because they create a ripple effect in your life.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.000]   And let's try to commit all of us
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.260]   to building some better habits in the year ahead.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.200]   Okay, that is it for this episode.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.120]   It was so hard to narrow down so many conversations
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.460]   and episodes into just 10 takeaways,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.640]   but it was actually a really amazing process for me.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.200]   I learned so much doing it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.460]   I really hope it's helpful for you as well.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.140]   If you had any other big takeaways from the show
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.200]   from the past year, I would love to hear them.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.280]   Please send me an email, podcast@allthehacks.com
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.840]   or leave a comment or review
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.160]   wherever you're listening to this now.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.800]   That is it for this week.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.080]   I will see you next week.
