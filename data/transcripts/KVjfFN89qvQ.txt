[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.240]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.680]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.460]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.560]   Today, we are talking all about the science of gratitude.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.380]   In part, we're doing this
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.560]   because of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday,
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.720]   which of course is all about giving thanks, gratitude,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.960]   but also because there's now a wealth of data
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.700]   showing that having an effective gratitude practice
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.840]   can impact a huge number of health variables,
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.060]   both mental health and physical health in positive ways,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.480]   things like cardiovascular health,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.500]   things like relationships, things like mental health,
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.720]   things like physical and cognitive performance,
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.100]   and these are not small effects.
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.880]   These are very large positive effects.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.700]   However, in researching this episode,
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.520]   I was completely surprised as to what constitutes
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.680]   an effective gratitude practice.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.300]   I, I think like many of you,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.160]   would have thought that an effective gratitude practice
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.560]   simply involves writing down a few things
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.200]   or many things that we're grateful for,
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.680]   or thinking about those,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.520]   or really making an effort to somaticize
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.840]   or feel some of the elements of gratitude
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.700]   while writing out that list or thinking about that list.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.520]   It turns out that an effective gratitude practice
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.300]   doesn't resemble that at all.
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.620]   The neuroimaging data, the physiological data,
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.780]   looking at things like inflammatory markers,
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.240]   other studies purely looking at the psychology
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.640]   and the long and short-term effects of an effective
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.000]   gratitude practice point to a completely different approach
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.800]   to using gratitude to positively impact health metrics.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.280]   Fortunately, these are things that we can all do
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.660]   very easily.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.040]   Some of them are actually fun.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.960]   You can do them in a variety of contexts.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.640]   So today we're going to talk about the science
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.720]   of effective gratitude practices,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.280]   and we're going to describe what those are
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.680]   and how you can incorporate them into your life.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.280]   Before we dive into today's topic,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.680]   I just want to highlight a particularly interesting set
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.600]   of findings from the literature.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.960]   This is a study that came out in the journal Cell Report,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.760]   Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.940]   It's very relevant to today's topic.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.720]   In fact, we're going to spend more time with this paper
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.680]   a little bit later in the episode.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.780]   The study involved having subjects listen to a story.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.760]   The subjects are all listening to the same story,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.820]   but those subjects are not listening to it together.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.240]   They're not rounded up in a circle or all in a room.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.600]   They're in separate rooms or entirely separate locations
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400]   on the planet, or they are actually brought
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.960]   into the laboratory on separate days.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.240]   What this study found is that different subjects listening
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   to the same story undergo the same variation in heart rate.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.160]   In other words, the gaps between their heartbeats
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   start to resemble one another in response
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.980]   to the same story.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.320]   Now, this is very interesting.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.640]   This is a coordination of the physiology of the body
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.560]   in response to a narrative, a story in different people.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   And yet when they line up the heart rates
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120]   of these different people who listen to the story
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.600]   at completely different times,
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.460]   they find that those heart rates map onto one another
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.600]   almost identically.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.620]   It's really remarkable.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.300]   We're going to talk about what this means
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.140]   in terms of coordination of neural circuits in the brain
[00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.720]   and neural circuits in the body and the organs
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.200]   such as the heart, but also the lungs
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.400]   and other organs of the body,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.040]   and what this means for changing one's overall state.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.140]   A key thing that's going to come up today again and again
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.840]   is the distinction between traits
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.640]   which are pervasive aspects of who we are
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.680]   and how we tend to react to different types of circumstances
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.780]   and states which are more transient.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.600]   They tend to, you can invoke a state in somebody,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.040]   a state of fear or a state of relaxation.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580]   But what this study really starts to point to
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.320]   is that there are specific approaches
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.520]   that any of us can take in order to really rewire
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.440]   our nervous system such that we are calmer
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.880]   if we want to be calmer in certain circumstances,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.560]   that we are more responsive in certain circumstances
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.640]   if that's our goal.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.840]   So we'll return to how one would go about doing that.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.520]   I think these results are just beautiful
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.320]   in the sense that they really show
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.380]   that our brain and our body are highly coordinated
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.800]   because people are listening to the story
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.300]   and the heart rate is changing in response to the story,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.120]   but that there is a, what we call a stereotopy,
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.560]   a sort of stereotyped response to a given story.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.760]   In my mind, there was no reason
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.560]   why the results had to be this way.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.960]   Two people listen to the same story,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.880]   why should their heart rates be almost identical
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.980]   to the same story?
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.160]   Very, very interesting and points to the power
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.920]   of narrative and story in coordinating our physiology.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.980]   And this is something powerful that we can leverage.
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.340]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.940]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.900]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.560]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.380]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.360]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.160]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.000]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.360]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.400]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.740]   and I can tell you that the visual system
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.420]   has a number of important features
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.560]   that allow you to see things with crystal clarity
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.440]   no matter what environment you're in.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.120]   So that means if you're in bright sunlight
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.480]   or you go into shadows,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.280]   you should be able to see everything clearly,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   but many eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.920]   actually short circuit that feature of our visual system
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.880]   and make it such that we have to take off our glasses
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.100]   or if our screen dims,
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.060]   we feel like we can't see things quite right.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.940]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.920]   have completely solved that problem.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.380]   In addition, they're very lightweight,
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.440]   so you don't even remember that they're on your face.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.600]   And if you get sweaty, they don't slip off.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.340]   They were actually designed for cycling and running
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.480]   and things of that sort, but they have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   So I wear readers at night or out to dinner
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   when I'm driving, I wear their sunglasses
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.160]   and the aesthetics are really terrific
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.900]   even though they're so-called performance glasses
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.300]   'cause as many of you know,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.700]   performance glasses often make people look like cyborgs.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.140]   These sunglasses and eyeglasses have the kind of aesthetic
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.180]   that you can wear them anywhere while cycling, running,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.540]   but also doing anything else you might be doing.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.960]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.140]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.500]   and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.840]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.100]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.360]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.880]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.360]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.880]   to help you better meet your immediate
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.820]   and long-term health goals.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.760]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.460]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.720]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.400]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.840]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.000]   you can also get insights into your genes
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.040]   and how those affect or should affect
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.760]   your immediate and long-term health choices.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   A big problem with a lot of blood tests
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.160]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.520]   is that you get the data back
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.320]   and you don't know what to do with the data.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.920]   Inside Tracker has solved that problem
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.280]   with a very easy to use dashboard
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.200]   where you get your numbers back from your blood tests,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.760]   your DNA tests, and then it points to specific
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.020]   lifestyle factors, nutritional factors, and so forth
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.200]   that can allow you to bring the numbers into the ranges
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.720]   that are optimal for you.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.200]   And this is a huge advantage over other blood tests
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.840]   and DNA tests out there.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.680]   Another feature that Inside Tracker has
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.700]   is their inner age test.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.720]   The inner age test shows you what your biological age is
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.320]   and you can compare that to your chronological age.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.560]   And of course your biological age is equally,
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.880]   if not more important than your chronological age.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.200]   So this is an important number
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120]   that you can get from Inside Tracker.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.640]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.920]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.080]   And if you're listening to this
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   during the week of Thanksgiving, 2021,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.920]   and you live in the United States,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.540]   you can get a special offer for this week only.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.640]   You can get $200 off their ultimate package,

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.520]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.040]   Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.880]   keto-friendly cereal.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.840]   I'm not following a ketogenic nutrition plan.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.480]   What works best for me is to fast
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.360]   until about 11 a.m. or noon most days,
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.480]   and then to eat a low carbohydrate lunch,
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.040]   a low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.760]   and in the evening is when I eat my starches.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.600]   That's what allows me to be alert throughout the day
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.440]   for work, for exercise, and so forth,
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.160]   and then to sleep really well at night.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.640]   That's just what works for me,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.520]   but it does require that throughout the day
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.080]   I'm eating fewer carbohydrates than I am at night.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   And oftentimes I want a snack,
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.560]   and the snack I want is usually Magic Spoon.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.520]   Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.160]   13 to 14 grams of protein,
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.400]   and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.760]   It's absolutely delicious.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.640]   I particularly like the frosted flavor
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.640]   'cause it tastes like donuts,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   and then I try not to eat donuts.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.940]   No vendetta against donuts,
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.480]   but it's not really compatible with my eating plan.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.240]   They also have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.560]   They're really delicious.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   Any ideas you have about keto-friendly cereals and foods
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.680]   not being delicious, you have to try Magic Spoon.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.640]   It'll change your mind.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.480]   In fact, I'm getting hungry
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.940]   just thinking about it right now.
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.160]   If you want to try Magic Spoon,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.940]   you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.540]   Let's talk about gratitude.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.000]   And to begin, I'd like to emphasize the various aspects
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.760]   of mental and physical health that have been shown
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.860]   to benefit from a regular gratitude practice.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.760]   There are studies showing
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.400]   that performing a gratitude practice twice or three times
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.520]   or even just once a week can lead to a pervasive,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.080]   a long lasting impact on subjective wellbeing.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   People report feeling happier, more meaning, joy,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.560]   even awe for their life experience
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.440]   simply in response to adding a gratitude practice.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.720]   The key thing is it has to be the right gratitude practice.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.600]   And we're going to talk about
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.840]   what the right gratitude practice looks like
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.320]   in just a little bit.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.200]   But there are additional benefits of a gratitude practice.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.160]   There are studies showing that a regular gratitude practice
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.720]   can provide resilience to trauma in two ways.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.360]   It can provide a reframing and resilience
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.240]   to prior traumatic experiences.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.520]   So buffering people against the negative physiological
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.020]   effects and psychological effects of earlier trauma,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.960]   but also inoculating them in many ways
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.980]   to any traumas that might arrive later in life.
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.660]   So that's a powerful thing.
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.300]   And today we will talk about
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.560]   how that's actually accomplished.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.260]   It's actually accomplished by shifting the way
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   that the fear and defense networks
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.380]   in the brain actually function.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.680]   We'll get right down into the details of that.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.600]   The other thing that a gratitude practice does
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.680]   is it's been shown to benefit social relationships,
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.660]   but not just for the relationship
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.440]   in which you express gratitude, right?
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.060]   So on the face of it, you might think,
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.560]   okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.840]   over and over, over and over,
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.520]   then I'm going to feel better about that person.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.360]   And indeed that is one effect of a gratitude practice
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.880]   that's called a prosocial or inter-social gratitude practice.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.800]   But there are now several studies,
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.480]   recent studies in good journals,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.600]   pointing to the fact that a regular gratitude practice
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.900]   can also enhance one's social relationships
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.080]   across the board, in the workplace, at school,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.040]   with family, in romantic relationships,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.880]   and even one's relationship to themselves,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.400]   which is really what the subjective feelings
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.500]   of wellbeing are.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.240]   So it's clear to me that an effective gratitude practice
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   has an outsized effect on many, many aspects
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.720]   of mental and physical health.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.840]   And for those of you that are coming to this conversation
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.820]   thinking gratitude practice,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.680]   oh, that's kind of wishy-washy or woo,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.720]   it's going to involve putting your hand on your heart
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.640]   and feeling into all the amazing things
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.520]   that you happen to have,
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.920]   even when things are really terrible,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.760]   that's not where we're going at all.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.700]   And equally important is to understand that the neurochemical,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.720]   the anti-inflammatory, and the neural circuit mechanisms
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.480]   that gratitude can invoke are equally on par
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.160]   with some of the effects of pharmacology,
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.120]   of things like high-intensity interval training
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.300]   and exercise, and other things that we think of
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.640]   as kind of more potent forms of self-intervention.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.120]   So if you are of the mindset that a gratitude practice
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.760]   is kind of weak sauce, buckle up,
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.680]   because the data actually point to the fact
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.160]   that a gratitude practice is a very, very potent way
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.700]   in which you can steer your mental and physical health
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.360]   in positive directions,
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.880]   and that those effects are very long-lasting.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.000]   Before we dive into the tools and mechanisms
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.120]   and scientific studies around gratitude,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.520]   I'd like to just set the framework for the discussion.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.140]   Gratitude is what we call a prosocial behavior
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.600]   or a prosocial mindset.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.780]   Now, you can be grateful for something
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.880]   without it involving anybody else.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.420]   So the social part isn't meant to convey anything
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.580]   about interpersonal relations, although it can.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.800]   And today we're going to talk a lot
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.720]   about how interpersonal relations can be incorporated
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.600]   into a gratitude practice in really powerful ways.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.540]   But prosocial behaviors are basically any behavior
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.880]   or mode of thinking that allow us to be more effective
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.440]   in interactions with other people, including ourselves.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.560]   Now, prosocial is not just a name
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.800]   that we give these different tools
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.760]   and practices and mindsets.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.100]   They're actually neural circuits in the brain
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.900]   that are specifically wired
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.200]   for prosocial thoughts and behaviors.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.740]   And these are distinctly different
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.020]   from the circuits in the brain
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.440]   that are involved in defensive behaviors.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.900]   So without getting into too much detail just yet,
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.720]   we will later, we have circuits in the brain
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   that are what we call a repetitive.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.960]   They are designed to bring us closer to things
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.040]   and to bring us into closer relation
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.020]   to the details of that sensory experience.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.160]   Now, that could be a delicious food that you're eating.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   It could be interacting with a loved one.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.280]   It could be interacting with a friend
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.940]   or anyone that you happen to like.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   It could even be in your relation to yourself.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.500]   These circuits that we're calling prosocial circuits
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.560]   light up in the brain in neuroimaging,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720]   meaning the neurons are firing more actively,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   more electrically, robustly,
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.640]   sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.660]   in the brain.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.360]   And the neural circuits in the brain
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.400]   that are associated with aversive or defensive behaviors,
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.500]   things like backing up,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.700]   things like covering up the vital organs of the body,
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.720]   things like a quaking of the voice,
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.920]   all of the things that are associated
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.200]   with defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.720]   meaning they are reduced
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.760]   when the prosocial circuits are more active.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.680]   So the framework here that I'd like to set
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.400]   is that we have this kind of seesaw
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.920]   of neural circuits in the brain.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.120]   One set that are prosocial
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.600]   and are designed to bring us closer to others,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.920]   including ourselves,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.420]   closer to certain sensory experiences, right?
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.140]   Because a lot of prosocial behaviors
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.400]   can also be geared towards things like pets or food
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.080]   or anything that we find we want to be closer to
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.120]   and want more of.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.840]   Whereas the defensive circuits involve areas of the brain,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.480]   yes, such as areas that are involved in fear,
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.880]   but also areas of the brain and body
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.840]   that are literally associated with freezing
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.160]   or with backing up.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.880]   So the way to think about gratitude
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.520]   is that it falls under this category of prosocial behaviors,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.120]   which are designed to bring us closer
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.720]   to different types of things
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.880]   and to enhance the level of detail
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.280]   that we extract from those experiences.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.720]   Now, the existence of these two neural circuits
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.520]   that I've placed on this sort of a metaphorical seesaw,
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.360]   if you will,
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.320]   runs counter to a lot of the messaging
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.160]   or the ideas that were put forth in the last century
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.960]   about the psychology of happiness and gratitude
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   versus the psychology of depression and struggle
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.240]   and concern about the future.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.360]   In fact, I'd like to read a quote from the great,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   and we really should call him the great Sigmund Freud
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.820]   because despite having certain traits
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.140]   that people criticize him of,
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.840]   Freud was indeed a genius about many aspects of psychology.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   But I just want to read you
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.360]   Freud's stance on happiness,
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.080]   and this invokes elements of gratitude as well,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.000]   and then you can gauge for yourself.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.720]   Quote, "Our possibilities of happiness
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.600]   "are already restricted by our constitution."
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.300]   So he's saying that we're basically wired
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.840]   to not have happiness easily.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.280]   "Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.820]   "We are threatened with suffering from three directions,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.360]   "one from our own body,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.660]   "which is doomed to decay and dissolution
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.800]   "and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.020]   "as warning signals.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.860]   "Two, from the external world,
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.960]   "which may rage against us with overwhelming
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   "and merciless forces of destruction.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.600]   "And three, and finally, from our relations with others,
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800]   "the suffering of which from this last source
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.300]   "is perhaps more painful to us than any other."
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.580]   That's Sigmund Freud.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.540]   And not all of his writings were that pessimistic,
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.360]   if you will.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.820]   What Freud is referring to there
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.380]   are those defensive circuits.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.920]   And of course, he talked about psychological defensives.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.160]   And in full disclosure,
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.020]   I am a huge fan of much of the psychological literature
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.800]   and psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.340]   and his descendants, Jung and others.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.620]   I think there are strong elements of truth there,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.700]   but it gives you a sense of the kind of mindset of psychology
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.800]   early in the last century.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.640]   And then of course,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.880]   was the emergence of the positive psychology movement,
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.600]   which was really about invoking the understanding
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.320]   and eventually the elucidation of the neural circuits
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.400]   for things like happiness and awe and affiliation
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.020]   and things that we are calling prosocial circuits.
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.300]   So the field of psychology has a dark and light,
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.200]   if you will.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.380]   And the field of neuroscience has a dark and light.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.300]   You have these, what we call parallel pathways in the brain.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.220]   And we have parallel pathways in the mind
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.300]   that set us up for feeling good about things
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.620]   or for feeling less good about things.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.860]   I think what's really salient from the quote from Freud
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.580]   is that what he's saying is our default
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.680]   is to be concerned about the future,
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.560]   to be wrapped in our defenses.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.580]   And to some extent that's true.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.660]   And the reason we can say that's true
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.320]   is because most of us need a gratitude practice.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.560]   We need to do certain things in order to feel good
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.520]   and to feel happy.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.240]   We actually have to put work into it.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.060]   It is quite possible that there's an asymmetry
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.040]   in the way that these prosocial versus defensive circuits
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.660]   are set up such that because defensive circuits
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.940]   are designed to keep us safe psychologically
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.240]   and physically safe, that they have more robustness
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.180]   or they can actually drive our behavior more easily.
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:21.240]   I'll give you an analogy in the system
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.300]   that I'm most familiar with as a neuroscientist,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.720]   which is the visual system.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.700]   In the visual system, we have parallel pathways.
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.540]   We have neurons in our eye that respond
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.660]   when things in our environment get brighter.
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.340]   Literally when the lights go up,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.300]   these neurons start firing like crazy.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.300]   And we have neurons in our eye that respond
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.560]   when things get darker, when things start dimming
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.540]   or go from white to black.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:48.320]   The circuits for detecting darkening are much more robust
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.140]   and much more numerous than are the circuits for brightness.
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.740]   And that is probably related probably to the fact
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.740]   that dark objects or experiencing looming,
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.580]   meaning incoming objects and being able to perceive them
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.900]   is something that's vital to our survival.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.820]   Whereas being able to perceive the brightening of things
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.140]   might be important to survival in certain contexts,
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.620]   car lights coming at you at night or something of that sort,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.780]   but not as often in a kind of a evolutionary
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.520]   or ethological context as the darkening of things.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.020]   So I think Freud's quote and the field of psychology
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:27.700]   now point to the fact that indeed we have the capacity
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.400]   for happiness and we have the capacity for great worry
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.480]   and concern and depression and unhappiness.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.920]   And the neural circuit literature also supports that.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.560]   The key thing for today's discussion is that gratitude
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.780]   turns out to be one of the most potent wedges
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.240]   by which we can insert our thinking.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.460]   And as you also see the physiology of our body
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.440]   between these two circuits and give a little more levity,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   if you will, to the side of the seesaw that's associated
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.400]   with positive prosocial feelings.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.760]   And if you keep imagining this seesaw imagery,
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.280]   what's really beautiful about gratitude practices
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.040]   is that if they're performed repeatedly
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.640]   and not even that often, but repeatedly,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.820]   then one can actually shift their neural circuits
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.500]   such that the seesaw that I'm calling prosocial
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.220]   versus defensive behaviors can actually start to tilt.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.660]   And the little hinge, if you will,
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.060]   on the seesaw in the middle can be adjusted in
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:28.560]   a little tighter when the side for gratitude
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.360]   and for wellbeing and for feelings of happiness
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.800]   is a little bit higher.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.220]   What this means is that whether or not Freud
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.300]   was right or wrong, whether or not the neuroscientists
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.300]   in one camp or another right or wrong,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.660]   we now know with certainty that a regular gratitude practice
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.120]   can shift the prosocial circuit so that they dominate
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.020]   our physiology and our mindset in ways that can enhance
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.940]   many, many aspects of our physical and mental health
[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.840]   by default.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.320]   So we don't always have to constantly be in practice
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.920]   trying to be happy.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.180]   So the succinct way of saying all this is yes, indeed,
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.300]   we might be wired or in such that we have
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.260]   a greater propensity for unhappiness than happiness,
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.940]   but gratitude practices provided they are the effective ones
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.320]   and they are performed regularly can shift those circuits
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.760]   such that we are happier on average,
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.240]   even when we are not performing those practices.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.920]   Now I'd like to talk about some of the neurochemistry
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.580]   and neural circuits associated with gratitude
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.680]   and prosocial behaviors.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   Numerous times on this podcast,
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.560]   I've talked about so-called neuromodulators.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.240]   Those of you that might've forgotten
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.440]   or have never heard of neuromodulators before,
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.360]   neuromodulators are chemicals that are released
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.480]   in the brain and body that change the activity
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.640]   of other neural circuits.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.820]   They make certain brain areas more likely to be active
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.560]   and other brain areas less likely to be active.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.000]   These neuromodulators have names like dopamine, serotonin,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.960]   acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so on.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   The main neuromodulators associated with gratitude
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.440]   and prosocial behaviors tends to be serotonin.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.820]   Serotonin is released from a very small collection
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.940]   of neurons in the brainstem called the RAFAE,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.640]   R-A-P-H-E, the RAFAE nucleus,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.200]   and a few other places in the brain.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.720]   And the RAFAE neurons send these little wires
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.040]   that we call axons out to numerous places in the brain.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.160]   And they tend to increase the activity
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.200]   of particular neural circuits that lend themselves
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.840]   to more approach to particular types of experiences.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.160]   That makes total sense if you think about it.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.120]   Have a chemical that under certain circumstances
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.360]   is released in the brain that triggers the activity
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.900]   of neural circuits that makes the organism, you,
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.440]   more likely to stay in an interaction with something
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.760]   or even lean in and seek a more detailed interaction
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.280]   with that person, place, or thing.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.040]   Beautiful work from a cognitive neuropsychologist.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.120]   His name is Antonio Damasio.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.400]   He's a world-class neuroscientist.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.200]   He's been in the game a very long time.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.420]   Has explored the so-called neural correlates of gratitude.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.040]   And two main brain areas are activated
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.400]   by these serotonergic systems.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.960]   And when people experience something
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.460]   that makes them feel gratitude,
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.840]   even if it's shallow gratitude or deep,
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.940]   and if it's all the way to deep gratitude,
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.580]   they see activation of these particular brain circuits
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.500]   I'll mention in a moment.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.720]   And the amount of activation scales
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.600]   with how intensely the person experienced
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.480]   the feeling of gratitude.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.460]   And those two areas have particular names.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.540]   You don't need to know the names,
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.840]   but for those of you that want to know,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.920]   they are the anterior cingulate cortex
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.880]   and the medial prefrontal cortex.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.340]   And of course, these brain areas are connected
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.440]   to a number of other networks in the brain.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.560]   In fact, that's how they get you or others
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.060]   to lean into certain experiences
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.400]   because when these areas are active,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.040]   certain thought processes get invoked.
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.980]   Those thought processes probably resemble something like,
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.020]   hmm, I'd like to experience more of this
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.500]   or hmm, this feels really good.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.580]   And then they literally feed onto your muscles
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.860]   via the neurons, making you happy to stay stationary
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.320]   if you're experiencing something you like,
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.020]   or to move closer to something that you find attractive
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.700]   to you literally.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.580]   So these are powerful circuits.
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.900]   Of these two brain areas,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.740]   the one I'd like to focus on the most
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.900]   is the medial prefrontal cortex.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.980]   Many of you have probably heard
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.540]   of the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:30.760]   because this is the area of the brain
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.140]   that is involved in planning and in deep thinking
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.760]   and evaluation of different types of experiences,
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.800]   past, present, or future.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.380]   It seems actually that pretty much every study
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.340]   of a human anything seems to involve
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.660]   the medial prefrontal cortex,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.740]   or at least one could get that impression
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.440]   just by looking at scientific abstracts
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.580]   and papers these days.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.900]   So I think it's worth us taking a step back and asking,
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.220]   what does the medial prefrontal cortex really do, right?
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.560]   How could this one piece of neural real estate
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.720]   that we all have right behind our forehead,
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.340]   how could that be involved in so many different things?
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.540]   And the reason it can be involved
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.580]   in so many different things,
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.220]   and the reason it's especially important for gratitude
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.600]   is that medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay?
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.940]   It sets context,
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.300]   and it literally defines the meaning of your experience.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.660]   Now, this is not at all an abstract phenomenon.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.880]   I'm going to give a very physiological example of this,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.800]   and then we're going to translate it to gratitude,
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.840]   but I really want everyone to understand
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.140]   how is it that medial prefrontal cortex
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.760]   sets the context of everything in your life?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.480]   Well, it does it the following way.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.420]   You have a number of circuits deeper in your brain
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.120]   that simply create some sensations or they allow you,
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.580]   I should say, to perceive certain sensations.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.140]   Let's use the example of cold exposure,
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.140]   something that we'd sometimes talk about in this podcast
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.080]   for other reasons.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.320]   If you were to deliberately place yourself into an ice bath,
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.660]   it would be uncomfortable,
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.000]   even if you're adapted to cold and so forth.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.740]   The discomfort is non-negotiable.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.000]   However, if you are doing it because you want to,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.600]   or because you have knowledge
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.740]   that there are particular health benefits,
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.880]   the medial prefrontal cortex can then control areas
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.280]   of your deeper brain, like the hypothalamus,
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.060]   to positively impact the neurochemicals
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.440]   that are released into your system.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.120]   You'll still get a lot of adrenaline
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.800]   by getting into the ice bath,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.880]   but the fact that you are doing this deliberately
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.380]   and your knowledge that you are making the choice,
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.840]   that it's you that's deciding
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.460]   to put yourself through this discomfort,
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.840]   has been shown to create a very different
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.240]   and positive effect on things like dopamine,
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.200]   on things like anti-inflammatory markers
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.740]   in your immune system, et cetera,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.660]   compared to if someone pushes you into an ice bath,
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.400]   or if you are doing it because someone insists
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.780]   that you do it and you really, really don't want to.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.800]   So there's a very subtle distinction here.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.940]   It's just the distinction of motivation and desire
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.680]   or lack of motivation and being forced into something.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.640]   And there are a number of other effects of this
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.800]   that have been described.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.200]   In the episode with Robert Sapolsky
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.220]   that I did earlier this last year,
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.240]   he talked about a study in animals,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.600]   which has also been shown in humans.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.360]   If you take a mouse, for instance,
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.000]   and it runs on a running wheel,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.800]   which mice really like to do,
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.400]   there are many positive effects on reducing blood pressure,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.480]   improvements in neurochemistry, et cetera, in that mouse.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.880]   However, if there's a mouse in the cage right next to it
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.200]   that's trapped in the running wheel
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.240]   and it has to run every time the other mouse runs
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.640]   because the wheels are linked,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.120]   well, then the second mouse that's forced
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.480]   to do the exact same running experiences negative shifts
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.680]   in their overall health metrics.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.300]   Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones go up, et cetera,
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.520]   because it's not actually making the choice.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.640]   Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.720]   or the switch rather, that can take one experience
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.080]   and allow us to frame it
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.000]   such that it creates positive health effects.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.720]   And the exact same experience framed
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.540]   as something we don't want to do or that we are forced to do
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.620]   can create negative health effects.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.400]   Now, how exactly the neurons
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.360]   in medial prefrontal cortex do that is rather complicated
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.580]   and frankly, not completely understood,
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.220]   but it's somehow able to adjust the activity
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.400]   of other neural circuits that are purely reflexive.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.260]   As we say in neuroscience,
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.720]   like really dumb neural circuits
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.400]   that are just like switches and place a context onto it.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:34.160]   So gratitude is a mindset
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.760]   that activates prefrontal cortex
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.400]   and in doing so sets the context of your experience
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.600]   such that you can derive tremendous health benefits,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.160]   which leads us to the question,
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.760]   what kind of gratitude practice
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.640]   is going to accomplish this, right?
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.080]   Because it is not simply the case that I could take a knife,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.760]   don't please don't do this experiment and cut my hand
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.680]   and say, oh, you know, I'm going to enjoy this.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.880]   I'm doing this because this is good for me
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.780]   and it won't hurt.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.480]   Of course, it'll hurt just like the ice bath is cold
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   no matter what, but I can't lie to myself, right?
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.920]   If I have some knowledge that cutting myself is bad for me,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.720]   that's very hard to override.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.240]   And so the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.320]   has a tremendous capacity to set context
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.260]   and it does that beautifully with respect to gratitude,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.280]   but you can't simply lie to yourself.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.240]   You can't simply say, oh, well,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.420]   every experience is a learning experience
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.380]   or a terrible thing that happens, oh, good.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.820]   I'm just going to say good.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.540]   And that your body will react as if it's good for you.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.520]   That's a myth.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.320]   And frankly, it's a myth that's fairly pervasive
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.960]   in the self-help and self-actualization literature.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.800]   We have the opportunity to reframe
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.000]   and set context on our experiences,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.840]   but that requires a very specific set of practices.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.560]   We can't simply lie to ourselves
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.760]   or quote unquote fake it until we make it.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.420]   Neural circuitry is very powerful and very plastic.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.640]   It can be modified and it's very context dependent,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   but it's not stupid.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.560]   And when you lie to yourself about whether or not
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.580]   an experience is actually good for you or not,
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.340]   your brain knows.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.980]   So what does an effective gratitude practice look like?
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.660]   Well, let's examine what an ineffective,
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.380]   what a poor gratitude practice looks like,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.080]   because therein lies some really important information,
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.640]   including the fact that I,
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.240]   and I think millions of other people out there
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.260]   are doing it wrong.
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.280]   Most gratitude practices that you see online
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.040]   and that people talk about in various talks and so forth
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.380]   involves something like writing down or reciting
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:46.860]   or thinking about five or 10 or three or 20 things
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.920]   that you're especially grateful for.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.120]   And then really trying to feel into some of those,
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.100]   really try and think deeply about the emotions,
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.280]   the sensations, the perceptions that are associated
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.020]   with those particular people, places,
[00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.340]   and things on your list.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.440]   Most studies actually point to the fact
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.800]   that that style of gratitude practice
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.660]   is not particularly effective in shifting
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.240]   your neural circuitry, your neural chemistry,
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.480]   or your somatic circuitry, the circuits in your body,
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.400]   'cause you literally have organs and neural circuits
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.320]   that are connected, the circuits of your brain and body
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.280]   toward enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.400]   enhanced activation of these pro-social neural networks
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   that we were talking about earlier.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.720]   Now that may come as a surprise to many of you,
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.220]   and certainly came as a surprise to me.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:42.400]   There is some evidence that if there's a shift
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.320]   in so-called autonomic arousal during these gratitude
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.100]   practices, these ones that I'm calling ineffective,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.640]   that they can be made slightly more effective.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.240]   So what do I mean by a shift in autonomic arousal?
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.020]   Well, very briefly, we have a aspect to our nervous system,
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.360]   both within our brain and body
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.480]   that we call the autonomic nervous system.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.560]   It's a little bit of a misnomer
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.640]   because autonomic means automatic.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.720]   And in fact, we can take control
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.320]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.840]   It has one branch, meaning one set of connections
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.600]   and circuits that are associated with making us more alert,
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.100]   the so-called sympathetic nervous system,
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.480]   or I should say sympathetic arm
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.600]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.820]   but that's really a mouthful.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.500]   It's really associated with enhanced alertness
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.880]   of any kind for excitement or fear.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.480]   And it has nothing to do with sympathy.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.080]   It's just about enhanced alertness.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   And then the other arm of the autonomic nervous system
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.680]   is the so-called parasympathetic arm
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:36.960]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.240]   but that's also a mouthful.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.360]   So let's just say it's the calming aspect
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.800]   of the autonomic nervous system.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.180]   So it's associated with decreased heart rate,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.840]   decreased breathing rate, et cetera.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.960]   So we have these two aspects to our autonomic nervous system
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.800]   and it has been shown that if people are brought
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.380]   into a state of heightened sympathetic tone,
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.540]   meaning more alertness,
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.920]   then the intensity of the emotions that they experience
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.420]   in their gratitude practice is enhanced
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.840]   and the effectiveness of that gratitude practice
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.640]   can be enhanced.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.000]   This is seen nowadays somewhat commonly
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.620]   as having people, for instance,
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.600]   cyclic hyperventilated breathing,
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.600]   as we call it in my laboratory,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.460]   breathing that's very intense of the inhale, exhale, inhale,
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:25.840]   exhale very deeply for 25 or 30 breaths.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.720]   Then people will sit in a meditative stance
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.360]   or they'll focus on their notepad and paper
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.680]   and they'll write out the things that they're grateful for
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.940]   and then they'll really try and feel into those things
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.620]   or they'll think about those things.
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.840]   And it makes perfect sense
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.320]   as to why enhancing autonomic arousal toward more alertness
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.100]   would create more robust feelings
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.820]   or more robust impact of these gratitude practices
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.800]   because in that state, you are more alert
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.020]   and therefore you are able to bring more detail,
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.860]   more richness to the perception and the understanding
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.520]   of what those things on your list happen to be.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.520]   But, and I should say
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.280]   that there are numerous other approaches to this,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.680]   sort of self-help type stuff
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.480]   and self-actualization seminars,
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.580]   people will do things like cold baths
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.860]   or they'll do chanting
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.440]   or they'll have any number of different experiences,
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.680]   all of which are mainly geared
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   towards increased autonomic arousal.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.420]   There are even practices out there using pharmacology
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.240]   to create increased autonomic arousal
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.740]   and then drop into gratitude.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:28.960]   Across the board, those increase the potency
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.720]   of the gratitude practice of listing things out on paper
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.460]   or in one's mind or saying them out loud.
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.940]   But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.600]   that form of just expressing thanks,
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.860]   expressing gratitude is not the most effective way
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:48.220]   to shift these pro-social circuits in positive ways
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.880]   for one's physiology and anatomy and psychology.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.260]   Turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.120]   is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.440]   or express gratitude,
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.400]   but rather where you receive gratitude,
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.040]   where you receive thanks.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.280]   And this to me was very surprising.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.520]   There are a number of studies about this now.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.480]   One in particular that I think is interesting
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.140]   is called the prefrontal activation
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.960]   while listening to a letter of gratitude
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.320]   read aloud by a coworker face-to-face,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.340]   a NIRS study, N-I-R-S.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.560]   I'll explain what all this means.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.260]   You now know what the prefrontal activation part is.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.500]   This is activation of the prefrontal cortex.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.240]   The NIRS, N-I-R-S, study, that's just a technical term.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.420]   It's a form of imaging brain activity.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.480]   It's non-invasive.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.640]   So it's kind of a skull cap.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.880]   It looks like a hoodie with a bunch of wires
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.160]   coming out of it basically
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.720]   that can measure neural activity
[00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.080]   without having to remove any parts of the skull
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.480]   or put a person into one of these tube-like fMRI machines,
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:50.760]   which is very invasive.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.100]   It's also a wonderful tool
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.580]   because it allows human subjects in the laboratory
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.380]   to move around and to engage with one another.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.240]   So in this particular experiment,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.340]   what they did is they had coworkers write a letter
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.620]   of gratitude of thanks to another coworker,
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.100]   unbeknownst to the other coworker,
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.020]   and then they sat down together
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.540]   and then they imaged brain activity
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.940]   as this letter was being read
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.640]   and as the letter was being heard, received.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.660]   And it showed very robust effects
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.680]   on these prefrontal networks
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.660]   that pointed to the fact that receiving gratitude
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.500]   is actually much more potent
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.660]   in terms of the positive shifts that it can create
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.460]   than giving gratitude.
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:33.200]   So this raises a couple of important points.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.320]   First of all, if you are somebody
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.900]   who is prone to write letters of gratitude,
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.620]   ideally, I think it's requisite
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.460]   that these be genuine letters of gratitude
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   or saying things that are genuine expressions of gratitude,
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.960]   this could be by text or in-person or by phone,
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   you have within you a very potent form
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.300]   of shifting somebody else's neurology.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.900]   Now, that's wonderful,
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.660]   and I think there are many people like that out there,
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.940]   but for many people who want to experience
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.320]   the positive effects of gratitude,
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.000]   it's probably not the most advantageous approach
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.020]   to just sit around waiting,
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:13.900]   hoping that someone's going to deliver
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.100]   all these letters or words of gratitude.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.240]   How is it that you can create that sense
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.280]   of receiving gratitude for yourself
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.140]   and thereby derive the effects of gratitude
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.920]   as outlined in this particular study?
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.160]   And there we go back to the important work
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.360]   of the great Antonio Damasio,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.020]   who explored these neural correlates of gratitude
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.560]   to define the areas of the brain
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.360]   that are associated with pro-social behaviors
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   like the prefrontal cortex.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.280]   And what's really interesting about the work
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.400]   that Damasio and colleagues did is,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.160]   first of all, they used functional
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.500]   magnetic resonance imaging.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.580]   So this is a very high resolution approach
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.360]   to exploring what areas of the brain are active
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.760]   and it has very high, what we call temporal resolution,
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.240]   meaning you can see things in time at very fine scales.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.040]   So a lot of mechanistic detail
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.000]   can emerge from these sorts of studies.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.900]   What they did was interesting.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.640]   Rather than have people express gratitude,
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.660]   they had the subjects go into the scanner,
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.200]   so their brains are being imaged,
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   and they watched narratives, stories about other people
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.000]   experiencing positive things in their life.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.620]   And in this case, these were powerful stories.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.200]   These were stories about survivors of genocide
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.520]   so that's what they're watching.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.800]   The subjects were subjects
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.160]   that were not survivors of genocide.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.220]   So they were watching these videotapes
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.880]   of people that had survived genocide
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.880]   and had people help them along the way
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.200]   as part of their story of survival,
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.420]   either psychological and/or obviously
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:47.640]   they survived long enough to make the video,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.120]   or physical survival.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.860]   So within these stories,
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.620]   there was conveyance of a lot of struggle.
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.680]   These people talked about the horrible situations
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.300]   they were in, but also small,
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.380]   but highly significant features of their history
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.280]   that had led to their own feelings of gratitude.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.380]   So for instance, it says a woman at the image,
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.320]   this is literally from the scientific paper,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.040]   somebody had been sick for weeks.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.960]   So the woman's describing how she'd been sick for weeks.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.400]   And then another prisoner who was a doctor
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.440]   finds a particular medicine somehow,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.540]   it doesn't describe how, and literally saves her life.
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.560]   Or an ally who was also in a stricken circumstance
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.460]   gave this person a pair of glasses
[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:36.860]   when their eyesight started to falter.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.080]   So these sorts of stories.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.120]   Now, just hearing this in the context
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.180]   of nothing but a scientific paper and discussion,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.340]   these probably aren't that impactful.
[00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.240]   What's really important about this study
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.300]   and is really important for all of us to know
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.000]   is that these stories of other people receiving things
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.400]   that were powerful for them in their life trajectory
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.640]   is embedded in story.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:00.220]   And the human brain especially
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.560]   is so oriented towards story.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.000]   We have neural circuits that like to link together
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.840]   past, present, future, have different characters,
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.680]   protagonists and antagonists.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.800]   From the time we're very young
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.840]   until the time we're very old,
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.200]   story is one of the major ways
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.000]   that we organize information in the brain.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.600]   There does seem to be storytelling
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.320]   and story listening circuits in the brain.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.880]   So what's important is not simply
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.480]   that these people survive genocide,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.160]   that's obviously important and wonderful,
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.800]   but it's not just that they were helped along the way,
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.720]   it's that the description of their help
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.800]   is embedded in a larger story.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.720]   So the human subject in this scientific study
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.180]   is watching these powerful stories.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.720]   And the neural circuits associated with prosocial behaviors
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.320]   and with gratitude become robustly active
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.740]   when they start to feel some affiliation
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.120]   with the person telling the story.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.680]   They start to feel some resonance.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.640]   We might call that empathy,
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.840]   but it doesn't necessarily have to be empathy.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.900]   Empathy is a somewhat complicated thing to define
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.840]   because it involves literally a setting aside
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.520]   of one's own emotions and really focusing almost entirely
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.460]   or experiencing almost entirely the emotions of another.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.740]   It could be sympathy, it could be empathy.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.000]   What we do know is that the stories themselves
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.600]   were able to shift the physiology of the subjects
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.860]   in this study and activate these,
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.980]   what we're calling gratitude circuitry
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.940]   that involves the prefrontal cortex.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.980]   So if you think about the earlier study
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.460]   that receiving gratitude is the most powerful way
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.000]   to activate these circuits for gratitude,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.820]   the subjects in this study in many ways
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.720]   are receiving a sense of gratitude,
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.320]   but through the narrative of one of these other subjects,
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.800]   which I find fascinating.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.140]   I would have thought a great gratitude practices
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.260]   would be to sit down and list out
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.480]   all the things you're grateful for.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.180]   That just seems so logical to me,
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.860]   but it turns out that these neural circuits
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.700]   don't work that way.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.480]   That to really activate these circuits for gratitude
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.480]   and the serotonin and probably the oxytocin system as well
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.380]   and its prefrontal networks,
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.900]   one has to powerfully associate
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.100]   with the idea of receiving help, okay?
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.960]   The subjects are associating or experiencing empathy
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.780]   or sympathy for somebody else who received help.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.160]   In the other study we described a few minutes ago,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.220]   the person hearing the letter was receiving gratitude
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.040]   and that would amplify the activity of these circuits.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.060]   And that takes us to a larger theme
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.420]   of what are these prosocial circuits?
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.380]   And an important concept to emerge from this
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.720]   is one that's most often associated
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.860]   with the autism literature, frankly,
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.200]   which is this idea of theory of mind.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.000]   So just very briefly, theory of mind is the ability
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.900]   to attribute or to understand the experience of another
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.820]   without actually experiencing the thing
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:49.000]   that they're experiencing.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.720]   Again, it kind of sounds like empathy,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.720]   but this was actually a term that's now been demonstrated
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.520]   in the psychology and neuroscience
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.000]   that's been linked to some very robust findings
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.140]   associated with brain areas and so forth
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:07.700]   that was looking at autistic kids and non-autistic kids.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.660]   The person largely responsible for developing theory of mind
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.560]   is Simon Baron Cohen.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.620]   I believe he's either the brother or the cousin.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:18.260]   I can't recall which to the comedian, Sasha Baron Cohen.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.100]   Simon Baron Cohen is a professor at Oxford University,
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.120]   or at least he was the last time I checked.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.500]   And the theory of mind test can be done on adults
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.880]   or on children.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.780]   And we can sort of do that experiment right now,
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.860]   if you like, and you can think about how you would behave
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.420]   if you were a subject in a theory of mind test.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.580]   Theory of mind test involves you or a child
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.160]   or some other adults sitting down and watching a video
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.020]   of a child going into a room or a person going to a room,
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.440]   opening up a desk or a dresser, a drawer, for instance,
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.860]   or a desk drawer, and placing something in it,
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.680]   like a pen or a toy, and then leaving.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.760]   And then another person walking into the room
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.460]   and clearly looking for something in the room.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.280]   And one presumes it's the toy or the pen,
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.520]   depending on the context.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.640]   People who have strong theory of mind
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.400]   make the obvious conclusion that the person looking around
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   for the pen or the toy is confused, or they're perplexed.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.160]   They don't know where the toy is.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.440]   They're looking for the toy.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.040]   Someone who is fairly far to one side of the autism
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.200]   or Asperger's spectrum will simply focus
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.760]   on the location of the object,
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.680]   on the location of the pen or the toy.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.260]   And this is especially true in children.
[00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.080]   They will say, "Well, it's in the second drawer.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.900]   It's in the second drawer."
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.720]   And they'll say, "Well, how does the person
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.640]   who comes into the room feel?"
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.220]   And they'll say, "Well, it's in the drawer."
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.320]   So they tend to focus on the specific factual elements
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.300]   of the scenario rather than place their mind
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.920]   into the mind of the other person, so-called theory of mind.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.240]   Now, that doesn't mean that people with autism
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.200]   and Asperger's don't have empathy.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.720]   In some cases, they can.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.120]   It sort of depends on where they are
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.600]   on the spectrum and so forth.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.560]   But theory of mind has very strong basis
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.880]   in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.720]   that we were talking about, because as you now know,
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.540]   the prefrontal cortex sets context
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.040]   on what we see and experience.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.860]   And the theory of mind task that I just described
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   very briefly is a pure example of context setting, right?
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.700]   It's not about just the factual elements
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.020]   about the location of the objects.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.140]   It's about the context.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.180]   Someone is looking for something that someone else
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.080]   put someplace that makes it such that that object is hidden.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.180]   So basically, theory of mind is your ability
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.680]   to put yourself into the mindset of another.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.380]   And in order to get activation of these gratitude circuits,
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.780]   one needs to put themselves into the mindset of another
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.080]   or to directly receive gratitude.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.580]   So let's just take a moment and start to think about
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.000]   how we are going to build out
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.900]   the ultimate gratitude practice,
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.220]   meaning the most effective gratitude practice for us to do
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.020]   because of all the many positive effects
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.680]   that an effective gratitude practice can have
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.080]   if it's the proper one.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.360]   It's very clear that receiving gratitude is powerful,
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.500]   but it's also very clear that waiting around
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.340]   to receive that gratitude is an impractical approach.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.500]   Now, there are methods that have been developed
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.780]   by my colleague at Stanford, Kelly McGonigal and others
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:26.280]   that actually have developed things for the workplace,
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.380]   for school, for coworkers and students
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:32.500]   to write out particular worksheets related to, you know,
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.600]   what they're thankful for from others and exchange them.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.200]   And so those are very useful practices.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.520]   I don't want to take anything away from the important work
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.520]   that Kelly and others have done.
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:42.960]   But in the absence of having other people
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.140]   to do these practices with,
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.380]   what we know for sure is that there has to be
[00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:53.140]   a real experience of somebody else's experience
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.440]   and that the best way to do that is story.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.740]   So in thinking about how to build out
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:00.980]   an effective gratitude practice,
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.940]   it's very worthwhile, I believe,
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.940]   to find someone's narrative that's powerful for you.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.680]   In many ways to think about this is
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.760]   it's got to be a story that inspires you
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.780]   because of the, for lack of a better phrase,
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.640]   the beauty of the human spirit
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.860]   or the ability of humans to help other humans.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.440]   And I find this remarkable because what this really means
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.080]   is that the circuits for gratitude
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.320]   are such that we can exchange gratitude.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.280]   We can actually observe someone else getting help,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.760]   someone else giving help.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.020]   And that observation of our species
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:44.200]   doing that for one another allows us to experience
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.880]   the feeling of a genuine chemical
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.540]   and neural circuit activation lift, if you will.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.820]   Very, very different than simply writing out the things
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.680]   that you're thankful for, right?
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.800]   And so how would you do this?
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.000]   Well, people digest story in a number of different ways.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.880]   People watch movies, people listen to podcasts,
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.980]   people read books.
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.520]   There are a tremendous number of stories out there.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.820]   It's clear that an effective gratitude practice
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.260]   has to be repeated from time to time.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.600]   So what I would not suggest is that we build a protocol
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.380]   in which you're constantly foraging
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.160]   for inspirational stories over and over again.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.280]   Social media and the internet are replete with those.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.200]   That's not going to be a very potent protocol or tool
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.820]   because the most potent protocol or tool for gratitude
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.560]   is going to be one that you repeat over and over again.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:36.320]   Rather, the most effective protocol or tool
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.800]   is going to be either to think into,
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.380]   and you could write this out if you like,
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:45.360]   but think into when somebody was thankful
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.720]   for something that you did and really start to think about
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.640]   how you felt in receiving that gratitude,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   or, and or I should say, imagining or thinking about deeply
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.020]   the emotional experience of somebody else receiving help.
[00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.180]   Now, what narrative you select
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.960]   is going to be very dependent on you and your taste.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.840]   It's going to be very dependent on what resonates with you.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:14.180]   But again, I want to emphasize that the story
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:17.080]   that you select does not have to have any semblance
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.720]   to your own life experience.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.000]   It's just about what happens to move you.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.940]   And so the way that one could do this,
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:26.200]   and actually I've started this practice for myself
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.100]   on the basis of the learnings I've had
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.280]   in the last few weeks around preparing for this episode,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.040]   is to find a story that's particularly meaningful for you.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.000]   And then to just take some short notes, bullet point notes
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.540]   about maybe list out, for instance,
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.360]   on just a small sheet of paper or in your phone,
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.960]   if that's your preference, just list out, for instance,
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.700]   what the struggle was, what the help was,
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.040]   and something about how that impacts you emotionally.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.100]   This is something just for you.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.380]   You don't have to share it with anybody.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.940]   That kind of shorthand list of bullet point notes
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:06.160]   serves as your shorthand for getting into this mode
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.320]   that we're calling gratitude.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.600]   And actually closely mimics a lot of what was done
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.760]   in these various studies.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.360]   Because even though the studies I've talked about
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.220]   up until now, we're really focused on
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.960]   what we call acute imaging studies
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:21.300]   where someone watched a story or received gratitude
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.520]   while the experiment was done, and then that's it,
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.580]   one and done.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.720]   There are other studies looking at gratitude in this context
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.480]   over many weeks, up to six weeks.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.360]   And what one observes is that there's so-called
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.560]   neuroplasticity of these circuits.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.520]   Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   ability to change in response to experience.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.760]   And that these neural circuits
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.520]   start developing a familiarity with the narrative.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.600]   So that, for instance, let's say you sit down
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.320]   the first time you've found a story
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.100]   that you find particularly compelling.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.080]   You've written down a few notes about what that story is,
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.160]   just to remind you.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.800]   And then you read those out and you think into the richness
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.380]   of that experience, that receiving of gratitude.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.340]   Or if you prefer, you're doing the protocol
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.100]   where you're thinking about when someone was deeply grateful
[00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:06.320]   or was genuinely grateful to you,
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.440]   that you're thinking about that,
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:10.020]   the neural circuits become activated more easily
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.400]   with each subsequent repeat of the practice.
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.380]   Now, this could be done literally for one minute
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.660]   or two minutes or three minutes.
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.080]   This is not an extensively long practice.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.700]   And that's another beauty of gratitude practices
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.500]   is that they have these outsized positive effects
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.560]   on so many aspects of our physiology,
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:29.460]   but these are very short practices.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.600]   They're the kind of thing that you can do,
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.800]   walk into your car,
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.320]   the kind of thing you can just sit down for a minute
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.260]   and set a timer and do,
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:36.720]   because they are really about changing
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.400]   your state of mind and body.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.640]   And if you have an experience of receiving gratitude
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.840]   or a story that's very potent for you,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:47.260]   it becomes a sort of shortcut into the gratitude network,
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.980]   these pro-social networks,
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.520]   meaning the activation of these circuits
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.240]   becomes almost instantaneous.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   And that's very different
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.400]   than a lot of other practices out there.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   I'm not aware of any meditation practices,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.840]   for instance, that you can do only a few times,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.640]   and then within a week or so,
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.920]   you just have to do them for one minute,
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.680]   you immediately drop into the kind of optimal state
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.120]   that that meditation practice is designed to create.
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.800]   There are some shorter meditation practices
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.020]   that are very potent and very effective like that,
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.700]   but gratitude and the circuits associated with it
[00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.600]   appear to be especially plastic,
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.200]   meaning especially prone to being able to be triggered
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.840]   in the good sense of the word triggered
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.780]   just by simply reminding yourself
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.360]   of this particular narrative.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:30.760]   Now there's another very clear and positive effect
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.840]   of using this narrative or story-based approach
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.480]   to a gratitude practice.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.240]   And that's what story does for our physiology.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.440]   Earlier in the episode,
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.840]   I mentioned this really incredible study
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   in which listening to a story coordinated the heart rates
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.400]   of different individuals
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.980]   and literally changed the way that their heart was beating.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.360]   The title of this study is
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.840]   "Conscious Processing of Narrative Stimuli
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.960]   Synchronizes Heart Rate Between Individuals."
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.500]   The first author is Perez,
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.820]   again, published in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal,
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.780]   excellent journal, and it's a really elegant study.
[00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.340]   They looked at instantaneous heart rate.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.000]   They use electrocardiogram to do that,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.400]   which is simply a way to look at heart beats
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.520]   with very fine precision.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.680]   They also looked at the breathing of subjects
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.700]   as they listened to these stories.
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.480]   Some of you may know that breathing and heart rate
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.800]   are actually linked to one another
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.300]   in a really interesting way.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.000]   The simple way to put it is that when you inhale,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.060]   your heart rate speeds up a little bit,
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.800]   and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.240]   And this is because of the movement of the diaphragm
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:40.580]   in your thoracic cavity,
[00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:43.460]   and the physicians and medical types call this
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.660]   respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.280]   There's a mechanism there we could get into,
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.640]   but I don't want to distract us from the main theme here.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.140]   So just remember when you inhale, your heart rate speeds up,
[00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:54.480]   and when you exhale, your heart rate slows down.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.320]   They looked at breathing,
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:57.900]   they looked at heart rate in different individuals,
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:02.900]   and listening to a story produced very consistent gaps
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:08.800]   between the heart rates of the people who are listening.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.060]   Different individuals in the study who were not located
[00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.080]   in the same place when they listened to the story,
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.220]   listening to the story in different times,
[00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.620]   different days entirely,
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.860]   had very similar heartbeat patterns listening to this story.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.820]   What this means for your gratitude practice
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:29.740]   is that having a story that you can return to
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.500]   over and over again, even if it's not the entire story,
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.240]   you're just using the shorthand bullet point version
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.240]   of your story, will create a perceptible and real shift
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.340]   in your heartbeat and in your breathing.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.080]   And actually that's been demonstrated over and over now
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.500]   that an effective gratitude practice is one
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.060]   that can rapidly shift, not just the activation
[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.320]   of these circuits in your brain for pro-social behaviors,
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   but also activation of particular circuits in your heart
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.760]   and in your lungs and the other organs of your body,
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.340]   such that you can get into a reproducible state
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.620]   of gratitude each time.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.020]   So an important component here is
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.200]   that there be some element of story.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.100]   Again, you don't have to listen to or read
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.300]   or think about the entire story start to finish
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.900]   in order to extract these benefits,
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.500]   and that it be the same story over and over.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.300]   And as a consequence, that's going to shift your physiology
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:27.820]   into presumably a more relaxed state,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:28.940]   because typically that's the one
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.940]   that's associated with gratitude.
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.960]   Although activation of these gratitude circuits
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.340]   has also been shown to create sense of awe or sense of joy.
[00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.120]   There are a few studies looking at and kind of parsing
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.460]   the difference between gratitude and joy.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.020]   I was able to find a few studies about that,
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.020]   but in general, they tend to,
[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.840]   the neural circuits that are activated tend
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.920]   to overlap quite a lot with those
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.300]   that create a sense of gratitude.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:56.700]   So we don't want to split hairs unnecessarily there.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.860]   The key thing is that you want to use the same story,
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.180]   even if it's your own experience or somebody else's,
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.280]   and keep coming back to it over and over again.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.940]   That makes it a very potent tool
[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.900]   that you can get a tremendous amount of benefit from
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.620]   with even as short as 60 seconds of practice.
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:16.180]   Earlier, I talked about how you can't lie to yourself
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.060]   and say, "You know, I'm so grateful for this thing
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.580]   that I actually hate."
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.100]   And in a moment, I'm going to tell you
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:24.420]   about some scientific data
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:28.180]   that proves the statement I made is true
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.820]   and that you can't just lie to yourself
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.940]   and derive the benefits of a gratitude practice.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.700]   The data are also going to point to the fact
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.540]   that if you are giving gratitude,
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.660]   not just receiving it, but giving gratitude,
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:43.000]   that too has to be genuine.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.800]   There's a really interesting study
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.460]   published in Scientific Reports,
[00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:48.780]   which is a nature research journal.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   The title of it is "Neural Responses to Intention
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.820]   and Benefit Appraisal are Critical
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.860]   in Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy."
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.820]   It's a somewhat complicated study,
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.500]   so I'm just going to hit on some of the high points.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.740]   But basically what they did
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.820]   is they used functional magnetic resonance imaging.
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.540]   So they could look at brain circuitry activation
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.420]   with very high precision.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.540]   And they had people receiving money
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.280]   in the context of this experiment.
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.440]   And they had some knowledge as to whether or not
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:19.980]   the money that they were receiving
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.360]   was given to them wholeheartedly or reluctantly.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.340]   And there were a number of different variables in the study,
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.920]   including how much money was given.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:28.280]   So in some cases it was very little,
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.480]   in other cases it was modest,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.720]   in other cases it was a lot more.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.980]   And they also varied the extent to which
[00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.220]   the giver of the money, that they called the benefactor,
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.660]   was doing it wholeheartedly
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.080]   or seemed to be doing it somewhat reluctantly.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:45.260]   And they looked at whether or not the sense of gratitude
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:48.260]   scaled with the amount of money received
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:53.120]   and/or the intention of the benefactor,
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.660]   whether or not the person giving the money
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.040]   was doing it wholeheartedly or reluctantly.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.680]   And what's remarkable is that
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:04.200]   while the amount of money given was a strong component
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.240]   in whether or not somebody felt
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.580]   that they had received gratitude, which makes sense,
[00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:13.440]   the amount of money is some metric
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.000]   of whether or not somebody feels thanked,
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   the stronger variable, the bigger impact,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.860]   came from whether or not the person giving the money
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.060]   was giving it with a wholehearted intention
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.300]   and not a reluctant intention.
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:30.040]   And of course, there was an interaction
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.840]   where the best circumstance, of course,
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.020]   is where the person received a lot of money
[00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.500]   from somebody who wholeheartedly
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.800]   wanted to give them a lot of money.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.360]   And they did every derivation of this,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.120]   but this is important.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.200]   This tells us many things
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.800]   that extend way beyond gratitude practices,
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:49.800]   which is that genuine thanks are what count, okay?
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.240]   We could probably presume that.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.800]   But receiving genuine thanks is also a strong variable
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.980]   in determining whether or not we experience real gratitude
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.960]   or whether or not it's empty,
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.120]   regardless of the size of a gift.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.460]   So this constrains our gratitude practices somewhat,
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.600]   but I think in an interesting and important way,
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.420]   you can't make this stuff up.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.740]   You can't tell yourself that an experience was great
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:20.560]   or that I got a lot of money and therefore it justified it,
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.080]   even though I think that they gave it to me reluctantly,
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.800]   or my boss hates me, but they gave me a raise.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.480]   That stuff stings for all the right reasons,
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.240]   because there are circuits in our brain and body
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.560]   that are oriented towards these prosocial interactions.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.240]   And in some sense, what we are looking for as a species,
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.600]   what these circuits want, if you will,
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.980]   is to receive things from people
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.820]   that are giving them wholeheartedly.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.900]   And that tells us that if we are the giver,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.960]   that we better be giving wholeheartedly
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.640]   or we are undermining the sense of gratitude
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.760]   that someone is going to receive from us.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.560]   So we are gradually building up
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.000]   the ultimate gratitude practice
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   based on the variety of scientific literature
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.340]   that's out there.
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.940]   And I know that many people are probably interested
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.080]   in developing a gratitude practice that has long lasting,
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.800]   maybe even permanent positive effects
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.320]   on their neural circuitry.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.760]   So with that in mind,
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.240]   I want to turn our attention to a really interesting study.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.860]   It's entitled Effects of Gratitude Meditation
[01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.040]   on Neural Network Functional Connectivity
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.100]   and Brain-Heart Coupling.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:26.000]   And to make a long story short
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.920]   and a lot simpler than that title,
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.780]   repeated gratitude practice changes the way
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.640]   that your brain circuits work.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.680]   And it also changes the way in which your heart
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.940]   and your brain interact.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:40.880]   You're familiar with the fact
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880]   that your brain controls your heart
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.240]   because you could be stressed about something
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.600]   that's perceived with your brain,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.520]   and then your heart rate will speed up.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.960]   You're probably also familiar with the fact
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.360]   that if your heart rate speeds up
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.840]   for some reason or no reason,
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.660]   you're probably thinking, well,
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.920]   what's making my heart rate speed up?
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.800]   And that's because the brain and the heart
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.980]   are reciprocally innervated, as we say.
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.920]   They're talking to one another in both directions.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.120]   It's a two-way highway.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.760]   This study looked at changes
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.400]   in so-called functional connectivity within the brain
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.600]   and between the brain and the heart
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.280]   in response to gratitude practices.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.040]   And as a control, they used what I think is very interesting,
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.880]   a resentment intervention.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.880]   I think resentment is an apt control
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.080]   and quite different than gratitude.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.120]   To make a long story short,
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.000]   what they found is that a repeated gratitude practice
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.860]   could change the resting state functional connectivity
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.320]   in emotion and motivation-related brain regions.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.420]   If I haven't mentioned a strong enough incentive
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:40.020]   for doing a regular gratitude practice until now,
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.600]   this is definitely the one to pay attention to
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.240]   because what they found was a regular gratitude practice
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.040]   could shift the functional connectivity of emotion pathways
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.320]   in ways that made anxiety and fear circuits
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.880]   less likely to be active
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.620]   and circuits for feelings of wellbeing,
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:01.420]   but also motivation to be much more active.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.140]   I find that remarkable and important
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.060]   because a number of people struggle
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.280]   with issues of motivation.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.500]   A lot of people who are highly motivated
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.680]   also have issues with anxiety and fear.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.320]   And so this study really points to the fact
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.320]   that it's a twofer.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:16.040]   If you have a good gratitude practice
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.900]   and you repeat it regularly,
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.760]   you reduce the fear anxiety circuits,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   you increase the efficacy of the positive emotion,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.940]   feel-good circuits,
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.800]   and the circuits associated with motivation and pursuits
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.520]   are actually enhanced as well.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.340]   So that's very strong incentive
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.920]   to have a gratitude practice and one that you use regularly.
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.360]   We'll talk about how regularly in just a moment.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   I don't want to go into too many details of this study,
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.440]   although we will put a reference to it if you like.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.960]   It includes a lot of FMRI data,
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.480]   imaging data of different brain areas,
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.720]   many, many tables and examples of matrices
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.820]   of before and after gratitude, after resentment, et cetera.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.160]   You do indeed have circuits in your brain for resentment,
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.080]   whether you like it or not.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.060]   We all do.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.560]   And some people just,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.500]   those circuits are more robust than others.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.680]   But the remarkable thing is one can shift these circuits
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.400]   in the direction that I think most people would like,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.600]   which is more sense of wellbeing and motivation
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.800]   and less resentment and fear, literally.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.200]   And what's really cool about this study also
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.800]   is that the interventions are only five minutes long.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.440]   It's incredible, five minutes long.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.760]   And so as we start to build out
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.280]   our ideal gratitude practice,
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.220]   we know that it has to have certain features.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.240]   First of all, it has to be grounded in a story,
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.680]   probably a story that you've heard
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.400]   in its entirety at least once,
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.880]   but then you can have a shorthand version,
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.980]   the so-called bullet points that I talked about before,
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.760]   that allow you to drop into that story
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.880]   or the emotional associations with that story.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.000]   So you don't have to listen to the whole story each time.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.160]   And that story should be one in which you are
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.400]   genuinely being thanked for something
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.740]   and it made you feel good,
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.480]   or it could be a story about someone else
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.640]   genuinely expressing thanks, okay?
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:03.240]   Based on the description of the gratitude practices
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.680]   that we talked about earlier.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.320]   Your gratitude practice can be very brief.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.300]   I mean, can it be as brief as one minute, 60 seconds,
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.840]   or five minutes, which still seems very brief to me,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.080]   although in these studies,
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.300]   they were getting these really major effects
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.380]   just from five minutes of gratitude practice.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:24.640]   Some of these papers involve people doing some
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.280]   focusing on their breathing and calming themselves
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.960]   as they go into the gratitude practice,
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.040]   but that's within the five minute block.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:34.180]   So if you decide that you're going to do
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.840]   a gratitude practice that involves first,
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.760]   you know, doing some calming breathing,
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.660]   exhale emphasized breathing, for instance,
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.840]   or physiological size,
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.540]   things I've talked about before on this podcast
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.480]   that can help calm you down
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.760]   'cause they have a lot of exhales,
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.620]   which you now know slows your heart rate down,
[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:50.820]   and then doing your gratitude practice, that's fine.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.260]   It's actually not necessary,
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.800]   but a lot of these studies used that.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.700]   I think once a narrative has been set,
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.740]   you've heard the story and it has meaning for you,
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.700]   or you have a recollection of a story
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.220]   where you are genuinely thanked,
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.680]   then I think just 60 seconds
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.160]   or maybe 120 seconds should be sufficient.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.500]   Then the question becomes how often
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.200]   to repeat this gratitude practice.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.260]   That's not exactly clear from the existing literature.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:19.760]   I can't point to any one study that says five times a week
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.600]   or four times a week.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.780]   So I'm going to throw out a number
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.560]   which is three times a week,
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.220]   and then people will ask,
[01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.420]   well, when should I do that gratitude practice?
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.580]   And I'll tell you what I tell most everybody
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.960]   about most every practice with a few exceptions,
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.900]   which is the best time of day to do this practice
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.620]   is when you first wake up in the morning
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.900]   or before you go to sleep at night or any time of day.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.400]   So we've talked about some of the neural circuitry changes
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.340]   associated with a regular gratitude practice.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.260]   And I should mention
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.100]   that there's an additional neural circuitry shift
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.340]   that occurs.
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.340]   It relates to a structure
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.020]   that I mentioned just briefly earlier,
[01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.500]   which is the so-called ACC or anterior cingulate cortex.
[01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.020]   This is an area of the brain that has several functions,
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.960]   but more and more data are pointing to the fact
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.660]   that the ACC is actually involved in empathy
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.900]   and is involved in understanding
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.740]   the emotional states of others in general,
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.060]   even if it doesn't invoke a sense of empathy.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:17.020]   And there are several studies that point to the fact
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.760]   that in humans who have a regular gratitude practice,
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.220]   the ACC becomes more robustly engaged,
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:25.400]   even with these very brief gratitude practices.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.600]   We actually have a project in our lab.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.360]   This is actually done in animal models
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.380]   where animals observe other animals
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.200]   experiencing certain emotional states.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.520]   And one of the brain areas that we've identified
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.420]   as important for this,
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.580]   it's kind of a primordial form of empathy
[01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.460]   'cause we really don't know what these mice are thinking.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.500]   We work on humans.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.400]   In the case where we work on humans, of course,
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.900]   we ask them and they tell us
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.980]   what they think they're thinking.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.260]   With the mice, we ask them,
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.020]   but they don't tell us much of anything interesting.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.620]   Instead, we measure a number of physiological signals.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.060]   But the important point is that the ACC,
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.720]   the anterior cingulate cortex,
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.260]   seems to be an important hub for the generation
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.380]   and execution of empathy as it relates to feelings
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.740]   and empathic behaviors,
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.420]   altruistic behaviors of animals helping animals
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.380]   and humans helping other humans.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.740]   We see this in the animal models.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.940]   We see this in humans.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:21.820]   So if you want to be a more empathic person,
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.080]   a gratitude practice is also going to be
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.580]   very effective for that, it appears,
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.020]   especially using this narrative type approach
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.300]   where you are using someone else's narrative
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.180]   of receiving gratitude as a way to tap
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.300]   into your own sense of gratitude.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.900]   Thus far, we've mainly talked about the effects of gratitude
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.660]   on neural circuit activation and changes,
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.820]   a little bit about some of the changes that are happening
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.420]   in terms of the body, heart rate and breathing and so forth.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.140]   But we haven't talked a lot yet
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.860]   about the changes in health metrics,
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.460]   in things like inflammation or reductions in inflammation
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.860]   and immunity and things of that sort.
[01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:00.140]   So with that in mind, I'd like to describe the results
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.180]   of a really interesting recent study
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:03.180]   that was published in the journal,
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.700]   Brain Behavior and Immunity.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.020]   This was published 2021.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.580]   The title of the study is Exploring Neural Mechanisms
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.700]   of the Health Benefits of Gratitude in Women,
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.160]   a Randomized Controlled Trial.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.340]   The first author is Haslett.
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:18.940]   And basically what this paper showed was that
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:23.540]   women who had a regular gratitude practice
[01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.300]   of the sort that we've been talking about up until now,
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.900]   showed reductions in amygdala activity,
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.300]   a brain area associated with threat detection,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.760]   a intimate part of the fear network in the brain.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.140]   So reductions in amygdala activation
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:42.780]   and large reductions in the production
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.460]   of something called TNF-alpha,
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.460]   Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and IL-6, interleukin-6.
[01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.380]   Now, if you happen to have listened to the episode
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.560]   that I did on activating your immune system
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.640]   and immune function, you heard about TNF-alpha and IL-6.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.100]   TNF-alpha and IL-6 are inflammatory cytokines.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.820]   These are chemicals that exist in your body
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.780]   and that are released from cells when there is damage
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:13.120]   or kind of a systemic stress when your system is in duress.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.140]   And in the short term, they can be beneficial.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.340]   They can call in signals for wound healing
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.140]   and repair of cells, et cetera.
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.900]   But you don't want TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels to be too high,
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:26.180]   and you don't want those levels to be up for too long.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.100]   And so this study is really nice
[01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.980]   because they showed significant effects
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:32.860]   in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.180]   in response to a gratitude practice.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.580]   And because they also observed reductions
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.220]   in amygdala activation,
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.260]   this area associated with threat detection and fear,
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   it's likely, and I should emphasize likely
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:49.780]   'cause I don't know, that the direction of the effect
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.260]   is that there are neural circuit changes,
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.100]   which in turn shift the degree
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.860]   to which these inflammatory cytokines
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.740]   are released in the body.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.580]   Although for all I know, it could be the other way too.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.020]   It could be that having a gratitude practice
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.880]   shifts something about heart rate and breathing,
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.700]   which in turn shifts or lowers the amount
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.980]   of TNF-alpha and IL-6,
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:10.500]   and that in turn reduces activation of the amygdala.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.980]   We don't really know the direction of the effect.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.660]   Excuse me, but if I had to speculate,
[01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:17.340]   I would speculate that it was a shift in neural circuitry
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.980]   that led to a change in the circuits of the body.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:23.020]   And another interesting aspect of this study
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.940]   is that the reductions in amygdala activation
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.740]   and the reductions in TNF-alpha and IL-6 were very rapid.
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:31.940]   They occurred almost immediately
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.980]   after the gratitude practice was completed.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.280]   And even though that study was performed exclusively
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.960]   on female subjects,
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.940]   based on the biology and circuitry of the amygdala
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:45.300]   and the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-6
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:49.380]   performing this inflammatory role in both men and women,
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.440]   I don't see any reason why the results of that study
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.180]   wouldn't pertain to both men and women.
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.020]   So what about the chemistry associated with gratitude?
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.560]   Are there certain chemicals in our brain
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.580]   or that we could enhance in our brain
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.020]   that would enhance our gratitude practice?
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.900]   Indeed, there are.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.140]   And earlier I mentioned the chemical,
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.980]   the neuromodulator serotonin as having a powerful influence
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.500]   on the activation of neural circuits
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.460]   associated with pro-social behaviors and gratitude
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.580]   and other sort of feel-good behaviors.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.060]   To make a long story short,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.800]   neuromodulators like dopamine and epinephrine
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.780]   and norepinephrine tend to place us
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.900]   into a state of exteroception,
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.280]   meaning a state of observing things
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.560]   and focusing on things outside the immediate reach
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.220]   of our body and confines of our skin.
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:37.180]   They tend to put us in pursuit
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:39.660]   or in thinking about things out in the future
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.140]   or out away from our physical body.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.300]   Whereas the neuromodulator serotonin
[01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:48.520]   and some of the associated pathways like oxytocin
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.380]   and other neurochemicals tend to,
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:53.460]   I want to emphasize tend to be associated
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.300]   with states that are about contentment
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.860]   with what we have within the confines of our body
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.420]   and our immediate experience.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:02.060]   So they're not so much about pursuit,
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.700]   but about gratitude and about appreciation
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.740]   for what we already have.
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.080]   I'd be remiss if I didn't therefore point out
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.500]   that if one were to shift their chemistry
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.100]   toward having higher levels of serotonin,
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.660]   you would by all logic experience
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.260]   heightened levels of gratitude.
[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.560]   And indeed, some people do this.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.820]   They will take compounds that increase serotonin.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.480]   There are a number of compounds out there.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:29.880]   As you know, I'm certainly not suggesting people do that.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.820]   A couple of the supplement-based
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.620]   legal over-the-counter approaches to this
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:39.520]   are things like 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:42.500]   Some people will take 5-HTP to try and enhance their sleep.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.640]   I'm not a fan of doing that personally.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.220]   I've talked about this in the sleep episode,
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:52.220]   but the state that we call sleep has a very complex
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.660]   and important architecture as it relates to neurochemicals.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:58.180]   And by taking serotonin by supplement
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.820]   or by stimulating serotonin release
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.540]   by supplement with 5-HTP or with tryptophan,
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.940]   which is an amino acid precursor to serotonin,
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.140]   one can run into the problem of disrupting
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.320]   the normal architecture of sleep cycles
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.160]   throughout the night.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.140]   I experienced that as if I've taken 5-HTP or tryptophan,
[01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.320]   I fall asleep very deeply,
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:16.940]   but then I wake up three hours later
[01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:18.540]   and I can't fall asleep at all.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.500]   And actually it sometimes even messes up my sleep
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.780]   the subsequent night.
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.500]   Some people are not so sensitive to 5-HTP and tryptophan
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.540]   and they actually really like it.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.580]   So again, you have to talk to your doctor,
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   decide what's right for you.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.340]   You're responsible for your health, not me.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.920]   And you have to determine what works for you.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.500]   Everyone's slightly individual.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:38.500]   But one could imagine enhancing their amount of serotonin
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.660]   in their brain and body by taking 5-HTP or tryptophan
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.980]   before gratitude practice.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.300]   That seems a little bit extreme
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.420]   given that the gratitude practice is only about a minute
[01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:49.180]   to five minutes long on a regular basis.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.480]   But there may be instances in which you're really trying
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.300]   to amplify these circuitry in the brain and body
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.980]   that are associated with gratitude.
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.340]   And therefore that might be something
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.960]   that you want to explore.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:01.180]   There's a new compound that's out there,
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:04.020]   a legal over-the-counter compound.
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:06.180]   At least it's legal in the United States.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.420]   I don't know about overseas.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   And that's a compound called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.200]   It's an interesting compound.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.900]   It goes by another name as well, which is,
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.220]   and I'm going to mispronounce this and I apologize.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:22.120]   This is Selesium tortosium.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.640]   Please see our timestamps
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.460]   if you want to see the spelling of that.
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:28.300]   But I'll just call it Kanna
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.320]   by its other name for short.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.520]   It's an herb that is traditionally chewed
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.340]   prior to stressing endeavors,
[01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.280]   is how it's described on examine.com.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.860]   But I looked at some of the studies on this.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:39.700]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.220]   It very likely increases the amount of serotonin in the body
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:44.460]   and pretty potently.
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.020]   It is generally taken in dosages
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.540]   of anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:55.540]   And it creates a kind of a pro-social gratitude enhancing,
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:00.080]   or I should say gratitude circuitry, pro-social
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.100]   neural circuitry enhancing effect
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.180]   because of the ways that it interacts
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.340]   with the serotonergic pathways of the brain.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.240]   So it also has another name.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.860]   It's sometimes called the Zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.
[01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.540]   Again, I'm not suggesting that people run out
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.440]   and take this stuff,
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.180]   but there is an emerging practice
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:23.380]   of people using Zembrin, Selesium tortosium,
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:25.860]   also called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.440]   In order to enhance the states that are about
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:33.540]   comfort and pleasure with what one has
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.060]   in their immediate sphere of experience.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.180]   And so one could imagine if it's safe for you
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.420]   and right for you and legal where you live
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.540]   in enhancing serotonin by taking Kanna
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.900]   and then doing your gratitude practice.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.180]   What's the logic behind that?
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.300]   Well, oftentimes we hear about supplements
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:56.500]   and pharmacology for quote unquote increasing plasticity
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.060]   or opening plasticity.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.780]   If I had a dollar for every time someone said,
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.800]   "I hear that such and such opens plasticity."
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:05.260]   Well, indeed there are molecules associated
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.200]   with the thing that we call neuroplasticity,
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.820]   but neuroplasticity is not an event, it's a process.
[01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.400]   Meaning it has many, many steps.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.700]   It occurs during wakefulness,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.900]   it's consolidated during sleep and so forth.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.700]   Taking a substance that increases a neurochemical
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.320]   in your brain will likely, provided it's the right substance
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.980]   and it's the right practice, will likely enhance
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:31.260]   the amplitude or the intensity of that practice
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:34.500]   and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:37.460]   Meaning it will create longer lasting
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.320]   or more robust brain changes than if one hadn't increased
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.540]   their chemistry in this way, this way of taking something.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.340]   But that doesn't necessarily mean that you couldn't get
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.960]   to the very same place without it
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.040]   by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.700]   or putting a little bit more mental effort into it.
[01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:58.960]   That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.540]   really resides in not just one approach,
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.280]   not just neurochemistry and taking substances
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.460]   to increase neuroplasticity, not just behavioral practices
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.440]   to try and increase neuroplasticity,
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.700]   not just brain machine interfaces
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.500]   or devices to increase neuroplasticity,
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.260]   but rather the convergence of multiple tools.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.760]   So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission,
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.960]   as we say, in the brain using something like Kana
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:25.260]   combined with a gratitude practice
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.560]   in the not too distant future.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.920]   This will probably also be combined
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.360]   with some sort of noninvasive device
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.980]   to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:34.320]   Please don't do that recreationally.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.820]   Those devices are for clinical use only currently.
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.560]   But I think you start to get the idea.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:41.920]   So for those of you that are a little bit more exploratory
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.100]   and you want to go and do some reading on this,
[01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.980]   I thought you might find a Kana interesting.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.080]   I certainly did.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.100]   There are a number of studies that will pop up on PubMed.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:53.080]   I recommend using examine.com as your jumping off point.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.460]   There are some decent studies that they describe
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:57.100]   in their so-called human effect matrix.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.760]   So those are studies done on humans.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.120]   And the main effects that have been documented
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.920]   in the scientific literature are minor
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.940]   but significant increases in cognition,
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:07.180]   executive function.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.500]   Executive function is something that's also associated
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.040]   with prefrontal cortex and reductions in anxiety.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.640]   And that seems to be a common theme
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.360]   that we're seeing again and again.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.480]   You saw this in the study, the trial,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.100]   where we saw reductions in TNF alpha
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.440]   and reductions in amygdala activation.
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:26.920]   So which would ostensibly lead to reductions in anxiety.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.760]   You're seeing increases in activity and brain networks
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.480]   that are associated with feelings of wellbeing.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:33.840]   So again, back to that kind of push-pull
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.200]   of defensive anxiety and fear-like circuitry in the brain,
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.840]   being antagonistic, as we say,
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.000]   to the circuits that are associated
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.780]   with prosocial feeling good,
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.040]   receiving good feelings type circuitry and events in life.
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.340]   So as you now know, there is a lot of science
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.600]   about how gratitude can positively impact neural circuits
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:56.060]   in the brain, anti-inflammatory markers in the body,
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.040]   brain-heart breathing coordination, and on and on and on.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.220]   I'd like to just highlight the key elements
[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:06.060]   of the most effective, at least to my knowledge,
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.540]   gratitude practice.
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.140]   And when I say the most effective,
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.860]   what I'm doing is I'm gleaning from the scientific studies
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:15.200]   I was able to find and combining the various findings
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.700]   of those studies into what I think is a very practical
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.040]   and what should certainly be
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:22.480]   a very effective gratitude practice
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.140]   for all the positive effects that we described.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.620]   First of all, that gratitude practice has to be grounded
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.320]   in a narrative, meaning a story.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.860]   You don't have to recite or hear that story
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.000]   every single time you do the gratitude practice,
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.200]   but you have to know what that story was
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.920]   and what the gratitude practice references back to.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.800]   Second of all, that story can be one
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:50.040]   of you receiving genuine thanks.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.560]   And the key elements there are that you are the one
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   receiving the thanks, the gratitude,
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:59.480]   and that it's being given to you genuinely, wholeheartedly.
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:05.440]   Or it can be a story of you observing someone else
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.840]   receiving thanks or expressing thanks.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:11.720]   And that has to be a genuine interaction as well,
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.800]   both between the giver and the receiver.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.380]   So those are the first three elements.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.600]   What I recommend would be after you've established
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.920]   the story that you want to use for your gratitude practice,
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:28.120]   that you write down three or four simple bullet points
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.760]   that can serve as salient reminders of that story for you.
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.200]   It will serve as kind of a cue for that story
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.200]   without having to listen to or talk out the entire story.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.040]   I would recommend writing down something about the state
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.720]   that you or the other person were in
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.020]   before they received the gratitude,
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:50.080]   the state that you were in or that the person was in
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.000]   after they received the gratitude,
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.480]   and any other elements that lend
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.380]   some sort of emotional weight or tone to the story.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:59.840]   This could be three pages of text if you like,
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.280]   or it could just be a couple of bullet points.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.360]   I don't think it really matters.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.440]   The important thing is that it's embedded in your memory
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.560]   and that it's really associated
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.040]   with this genuine exchange of thanks
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.920]   and the receival of thanks.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.640]   I think those are the key elements.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.600]   And then it's very simple.
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.520]   The entire practice involves reading off these bullet points
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.520]   as a cue to your nervous system of the sense of gratitude.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.280]   And then for about one minute,
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.820]   which is a trivial amount of time
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.580]   if you really think about it, or maybe two minutes,
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.640]   or if you're really ambitious up to five minutes
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.400]   of just really feeling into that genuine experience
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.760]   of having received gratitude
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.960]   or observed someone else receiving gratitude.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.320]   And then in terms of frequency,
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.000]   I think a good rule of thumb would be to do that
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.340]   about three times a week.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.760]   And the time of day doesn't really matter.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.280]   I can't see why there would be
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.160]   any so-called circadian effects of this.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.000]   I know some people like to do a gratitude practice
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.720]   before they go to sleep at night.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.480]   I don't see any problem with doing this
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.500]   before you go to sleep at night.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.320]   I also don't see any problem with you doing this
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.360]   on your lunch break or mid-morning
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.420]   or first thing in the morning.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.040]   I can't see any logic for placing it
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.660]   any one time of day and not another.
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:10.680]   So I think the most important thing
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.400]   is that you do it at least three times a week.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.760]   And as mentioned before, it's very, very brief.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.340]   So there are very few barriers to entry for doing this.
[01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:22.000]   So if we just take a step back from this protocol
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.120]   and compare it to what's typically out there
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.520]   in the literature, which is,
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.400]   make a list of all the things you're thankful for,
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.000]   recite in your mind all the things you're thankful for,
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:31.840]   count your blessings.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.840]   So I think everybody should be
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.000]   counting their blessings all the time.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.880]   There's always something to be thankful for.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.800]   But in terms of a scientifically grounded
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.040]   gratitude practice that is also scientifically demonstrated
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.000]   to shift your physiology at the level of your immune system
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.580]   and your neural circuitry, reducing anxiety,
[01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.180]   increasing motivation, all these wonderful things
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:55.860]   that so many of us are chasing all the time as goals,
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.400]   I think a gratitude practice reveals itself
[01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.000]   to be an immensely powerful tool
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.800]   for any and all of us to use.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.500]   And that should come as no surprise
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.940]   because these pro-social circuits,
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:09.760]   these circuits for gratitude are not a recent phenomenon.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.480]   Discussions about gratitude date back hundreds,
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.040]   if not thousands of years.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.160]   What we've done today is to take the modern science
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.360]   right up until 2021 and to really distill from that
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.880]   the neuroimaging data, the neurochemistry,
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:25.360]   the various aspects of brain-body connectivity,
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.920]   look at the protocols, take various subject groups,
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:28.880]   some were done in women,
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.700]   some were done in between two individuals,
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.080]   some were done with brain imaging,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.140]   all the various changes on a theme
[01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.680]   that allow us to point to a simple
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.920]   but very effective protocol that certainly we could all use
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.060]   around Thanksgiving.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:47.440]   But Thanksgiving is just but one day
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.400]   throughout the entire year, of course.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.840]   I personally have been using a gratitude protocol
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.740]   for the last several years,
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.240]   but that protocol was based on my ignorance really
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.280]   about the scientific literature
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.120]   and was mainly based on what I'd heard out there
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.240]   on the internet, which is that I should list out
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.640]   or think about or verbally recite the things
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:09.760]   that I'm grateful for.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.700]   The sort of protocol that we arrived at today
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.480]   based on the scientific literature
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.420]   is distinctly different from that.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:19.720]   And as a consequence, I've started to script out
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.700]   a protocol identical to the one I just described,
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.760]   and I intend to use that going forward.

[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.840]   During today's episode and in many previous episodes,
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.080]   I mentioned supplements.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.300]   Supplements aren't for everybody,
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.900]   but if you are going to use supplements,
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.380]   it's imperative that those supplements
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:03.920]   be of the very highest quality.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   For that reason, we partnered with Thorne.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.800]   That's T-H-O-R-I-N-E because Thorne supplements
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.720]   have the highest levels of stringency
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.440]   in terms of the quality of the ingredients they include
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.600]   and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   they include in their products.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.420]   They partnered with every major sports team
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.500]   as well as the Mayo Clinic,
[01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.660]   so we're delighted to be partnered with them as well.
[01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:24.300]   If you want to see the supplements that I take,
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:29.000]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.400]   And there you can see all the supplements that I take,
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.040]   and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

[01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.160]   learning about the science of gratitude.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.080]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.000]   thank you for your interest in science.
