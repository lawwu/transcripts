At an 8% annualized return, your investment portfolio at age 65 would be expected to be about $1.4 million. Not bad, especially for putting aside $5,000 per year. But at an 18% rate of return, you're making a Roth IRA contribution at $5,000 per year.

[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.540]   before was doing professionally, I knew
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.660]   what I was doing. And I had basically had
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.480]   90% of my money in index funds. I think at
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.960]   that time index funds were popular. So
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.100]   maybe it was actually mutual funds, which
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.700]   in retrospect, wasn't

[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   How do these things happen? And you look at so many of the modern companies, I don't know how to connect them to reality. And so I don't know if there's something that's broken with me, that I'm just old-fashioned and we're in a new world where the old rules don't make sense and the goal is to get as big as possible and lose money all the way through as some of the leading companies seem to do, or if there's something old. And so it causes me to be very insecure about decisions like that, especially when then I look at the old rules and I'm like, well, I don't know how to connect them to reality.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:20:15.380]   0:04:40.420,0:04:43.820 I don't know the answer. I'm stymied by the by the problem. I don't know the answer either. And I think what we do as a as a

[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.060]   you can avoid some of those stocks.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:43.120]   Now there's an argument to made that those stocks are very attractive. I'm not going to make that, but I think people can make money a lot of different ways. I mean, there are venture capital firms that, you know, invest very early and stuff and have had major returns and they literally do like two hours of work before they make a half a million or million dollar investment. It's pretty amazing. But you have one success there. You find Facebook and it's paid for every mistake you're going to make.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   But look,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   I mean,

[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   ultimately with the stock market,
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   it just gets very complicated. When you start to get into little stocks, I think to the degree that you don't want to bet on e toys in 1999 having a $30 billion valuation and people saying it's going to be worth that. And you can find parallels today. The way you avoid that is you basically avoid it to the degree of the more specific ETF that have a lot of names like that in them that aren't generating earnings. You can generally avoid those and you do that a pretty good job of that by choosing more boring investments.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   But look,

You're probably in this with something that's okay, because that money will be put in over a long period of time.

It's like, "I'm a good supplier." You know, we have a hedge fund, we have a hedge fund. It's different, but the axiom used to be you charge a 2% management fee and then 20% of profits. That number has come down some. There are lots of flavors of that. When you have an incentive structure like that, you can imagine the amount of resources and incentives someone has to try and perform. At the same time, you wake up January 1st every year and you know you have to outperform whatever your benchmark is by 2% until you even start to compare to them.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   So, you know you have to outperform whatever your benchmark is by 2% until you even start to compare to them.

[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:45.680]   Well, most common things that happens in hedge funds, hopefully this won't happen to us, but it's happened with most of them out there.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:53.740]   Uh, if you don't close to your investors and you keep getting bigger, it becomes harder and harder to generate a return.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.440]   Right, right.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:59.460]   Um, but there's a massive intent to do that because every dollar you take in generally just falls to the bottom line.

[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:05.020]   But yet the number of specialized areas of knowledge and skill 20 years from now is going to be incredibly exponentially higher than today. Exponentially higher. And we're in a world of increasing specialization. And so if somebody understands the blueprint of basically how these things work, how does somebody go the path that you have gone, then they can see the clues and yet apply it in a totally different way.
