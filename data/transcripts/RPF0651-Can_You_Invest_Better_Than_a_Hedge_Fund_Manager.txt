[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.840]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.560]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.360]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.800]   Today we tackle a subject on the show that we have not tackled adequately for some time,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.040]   and that is investing wisely.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.120]   The subject of investing is massive and can be applied to many aspects of life, but specifically
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.920]   today we're going to talk about stock market investing with somebody who is actively involved
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920]   in the business.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.400]   My guest is John Medford.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.680]   John, go ahead and take a moment and introduce yourself, please.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.960]   Share a little bit about the work that you are currently involved in.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.120]   So my audience can get a context of how you're coming to this conversation, please.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   Sure.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.360]   So thanks for having me.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:16.720]   I am a partner at an investment firm that invests entirely in publicly traded stocks
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   in the US and in Europe.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.880]   We've been in business for about 15 years.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.400]   We manage about a billion dollars mostly for high net worth individuals, endowments.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.440]   We're more specifically a hedge fund, which is a dirty word, but basically just means
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.600]   because we're really good at what we do, we're able to charge more in fees, but it doesn't
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.120]   have perhaps connotations that typically are associated with it.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.040]   So John Medford is not the name that John was born with by his parents, and that's what's
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.240]   giving us the opportunity to dig into some of the things that we're going to dig into.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.580]   So the reason that I wanted to have John on is because in this context, we can talk with
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.240]   somebody who's actively involved in the business.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.800]   It's a real challenge for somebody like me, who is a podcast host, to try to find interesting
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.080]   guests who are able to bring an honest inside look to the marketplace without having a significant
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.760]   conflict of interest.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.240]   Generally interviews have to be run through the legal team for compliance reasons.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.600]   Generally people who are on the show are actively pitching something.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.800]   It's just a challenge for me to give inside information.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   And so John is on the show here, and again, John is not the name that his parents dubbed
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.320]   him with, and that gives us the opportunity to chat inside about what's actually going
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.080]   on from somebody who's working in the business.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.000]   First John, I'd like to start with just a quick intro on how important returns are and
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600]   what this benefit is.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.120]   Because in personal finance, at this point in time, the safe solution for me as a broadcaster,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.320]   as somebody who's encouraging people to be thoughtful and careful with their money, the
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.600]   safe solution that won't result in my getting fired is to recommend to all of my listeners
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.200]   that they take all of their money and that they invest it into index funds.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.160]   And certainly I don't think that's an ineffective solution, but I also always look at those
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.400]   returns, and I always think, "But if you could get a little bit higher, it could do a little
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   bit better."
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.560]   So talk for just a moment about how, when you're working in your hedge fund, what your
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.040]   returns have been and how they compare to your competitive returns that you're being
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.680]   measured against, your benchmarks.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   Sure.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.720]   So, look, most funds don't do a good job.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.400]   The vast majority of funds are going to underperform their benchmarks, which is why index funds
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.040]   are so popular, and rightfully so.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.960]   I think Warren Buffett's been asked what he'd recommend folks do, and he always recommends,
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.680]   "Unless you're going to do it professionally, you invest in index funds."
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.160]   And I think he had a famous bet with some prominent people that ran hedge fund funds
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.520]   that the index would outperform their five or ten best chosen hedge funds over time,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.960]   and lo and behold, he's won that bet pretty handily.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.320]   So in terms of our returns historically, look, we were, for a long period of time, a smaller
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.960]   firm.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.240]   We do a lot of quirky stuff.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   We're exceptionally passionate about what we do.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.200]   We spend almost all our time doing it.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   I love what I do.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.400]   I find it really fun, like, so engaging.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.600]   I've been doing it for ten years at this point, but doing it informally since I was
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240]   probably closer to 20 years.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.960]   My partner who founded the business has been doing this professionally about 15 years,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   and our track record's really good.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:57.000]   So we've compounded our capital since inception at about 18% a year.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.800]   The market over that time has delivered, call it, 80-ish percent, roughly.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.680]   Now that said, that's our gross return, so that's what, as investors in the fund, we
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.440]   would get on our capital invested in it.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.920]   If you were to look at an external investor who has to pay fees, that number gets closer
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.760]   to about 12.5%.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.320]   The reason that Delta's so high is essentially, call it a 5.5% expense ratio.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.760]   But the reason we can charge that is we're generating excess return, and so some of that
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.160]   comes to investors and some of it comes to ourselves.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.840]   Even despite charging those fees, we still have an attractive product with a lot less
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   volatility.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.320]   Here is why I think these numbers are so important, and I wanted to lead with them.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.880]   I think that in many ways, people like me in the personal finance space have become
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.040]   cavalier about returns and their impact on people's wealth.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.280]   I'm very nervous using high predicted rates of return because I don't know how to tell
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.120]   a broad audience of people, "Here's how you get these returns."
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.760]   And the other thing that's challenging is doing this at various points in the market
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.760]   cycle.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.920]   I think over the last few years, almost anything has done well, but it's not always that way.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.640]   But if we look out over a lifetime of investing, rate of return is massively important, and
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.300]   it's especially important as your wealth grows.
[00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.880]   In the beginning, the most important number is how much you save, and that's for most
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.920]   people going to be driven by your income.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.480]   But quickly, as your investments grow, you quickly get to the point where the most important
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.600]   return number is the investment rate.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   And so here's to put this into context, how important this conversation is for the average
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   person.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.280]   Let's say you're investing over a 40-year career from 25 to 65, and you're putting aside
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.180]   just a measly $5,000 per year.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.280]   You're making a Roth IRA contribution at $5,000 per year, starting with nothing.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.000]   At an 8% annualized return, your investment portfolio at age 65 would be expected to be
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.800]   about $1.4 million.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.560]   Not bad, especially for putting aside $5,000 per year.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:17.200]   But at an 18% rate of return at 65, your investment portfolio would be $24.5 million.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.280]   Now let's use the retail rate of 12.5% for somebody who is investing with you, John,
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.280]   not you.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.680]   It's $5 million.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:32.480]   There is a huge, meaningful difference for actual spendable income, actual impact between
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:40.800]   $1.4 million and $5 million, and there's an even bigger impact between that and $24.5
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:41.920]   million.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.960]   So this matters hugely.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.080]   And I get really bothered because I've succumbed to this idea of saying, well, you can't get
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.680]   returns, market's efficient, et cetera.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.480]   And yet it's too important to just leave alone.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.800]   So to begin with, John, I don't want you to get into details, but let's say that you were
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.040]   advising me, and knowing that you can't just say, well, buy my fund, because that's not
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.040]   an opportunity in this context, how do you advise me to think about my stock market investing
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   dollars, knowing that I really want return, but I don't know how to get it?
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:20.240]   Even though I'm doing this not under the name my parents gave me, I will give the usual
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.360]   disclaimer that I just pick stocks, and I've done that for a long time, and I have my opinions
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.960]   about the way people might do things, but you should reach your own conclusions on that.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.560]   But I can opine on that with that caveat.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:41.480]   Look, you said this on your show, I think it's a really interesting concept.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.160]   I'm good at what I do.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.960]   I'm very bad at lots of things in life.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.760]   I happen to be good at this, and I love it.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.560]   And it so happens that I believe if you devote yourself to one thing, and try and become
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:04.600]   very good at it, and you're of reasonable intelligence, and you are humble, and you
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.040]   have a lust of learning and curiosity, I think you can be good at it.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.360]   I think if you don't do that, you might be able to also be good at it, but it's a lot
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   harder.
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.080]   So I would say in many respects, I'm not good at very many things, but it happens to
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.440]   be one thing I'm good at.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.120]   And so for that reason, I think it makes sense to do it.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.160]   My choice is basically investing in stocks.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.320]   Now it's horribly tax inefficient.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.560]   If I think from a standpoint of if I was just maximizing my wealth, I wish I would have
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.680]   spent more time understanding real estate, given the tax characteristics of that.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.880]   I think ultimately, the first question is, is there anything that you happen to be really
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.480]   good at or can develop a skill at?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.920]   And if it is, I think that tends to be the best place to put your money.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.960]   Now, realistically, if you have a full time job, and that job doesn't involve investing,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.000]   it's difficult to develop that competency, at least right away.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   So a couple of things I can say on this.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   So one, generally index funds are probably the best, but there's some huge caveats to
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.040]   that.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.600]   When you invest matters a lot.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.520]   In general, the market returns have been, call it 7%.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.960]   I don't know where the numbers are, roughly 7% over a very long period of time.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.640]   But depending on when you invested, that return can be very different.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:34.120]   So for example, if you happen to invest at the top of the internet bust to today, your
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.440]   returns would still actually be pretty decent, but they'd be much less good than if you started
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   your investing in 2009.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.680]   Now, this isn't an issue if you're putting $5,000 a year, but to the degree you have
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.480]   a meaningful bonus or inheritance or something like that, and you decide to put all your
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:11:00.520]   money into index funds at one point in time, that can result in some pretty bad scenarios.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.360]   So look, if you're going to invest in a stock market, I think index funds are definitely
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   reasonable.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.640]   I think one just needs to be careful about the returns that one underwrites.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.200]   I think from today, my personal opinion, is that it's not going to be as good as it has
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.440]   been historically, even if you look out over a 20 or 30 year period, at least on a real
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.000]   basis.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.640]   But I've been wrong on that, and that's not an area of confidence of mine.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.360]   If you do actually want to invest personally in a stock market, I think it's great to try
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   to build a competency.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:40.480]   I strongly believe that someone that really devotes themselves to stock analysis can actually
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.120]   build a skill and make money, especially in smaller companies, but it's just something
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120]   that takes a lot of time.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.280]   And so when I started investing in college, I'd say the first eight years I was in this
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.040]   business, even before I was doing it professionally, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.200]   And I had basically had 90% of my money in index funds.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   I think at that time, index funds weren't as popular, so maybe it was actually mutual
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.640]   funds, which in retrospect, I wouldn't have done.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:10.200]   And I had 5% or 10% in individual stocks, and I treated that 5% to 10% as not necessarily
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.400]   gambling money, but as experimental money.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   And then I watched my returns, and I thought about, I tried to be honest with myself about
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.800]   my capabilities, and if I thought I was doing a good job.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.660]   And as time went on, I devoted more time to it, I decided to put more and more money away
[00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.760]   from ETF and into individual stocks.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.560]   But had I not devoted myself to my profession in that way, I wouldn't have done it.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:38.400]   I would have found something else that I could have compounded money at in a better way.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.800]   >>DAVE Well, just as a personal finance observer,
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:50.040]   I would illustrate, with your being the partner, an investing partner in an almost billion
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.160]   dollar hedge fund, you can do both things.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:59.540]   You have an incredible synergy in that position of being able to earn a lot of personal income
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.720]   using a form of synthetic equity, using other people's money, and to invest at the very
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.840]   highest rates, and to invest a lot of money by using other people's money.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.840]   That's why so many intelligent, bright people go to the investment marketplace.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:18.560]   So you're doing great for you, but I'm going to go back to for the rest of us.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.880]   So I agree with you in terms of it seems to be a, it's not a consensus, it seems to be
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:31.560]   a highly echoed prognostication that future returns will not, over coming decades, for
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.920]   the market in general, would probably not be as generous as they have been for some
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.960]   of the past decades.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.320]   What's the argument though?
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.160]   What are the headwinds that are causing so many people to believe that, and Warren Buffett,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   just to pick on the most commonly thrown around name, many people are saying there are major
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.960]   headwinds.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.520]   What's the argument for that position?
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.520]   >>JASON Okay.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.760]   So I'm going to narrow this a little bit.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:06.680]   So I'm going to say developed markets, I'd say US and developed Europe, I'm going to
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.880]   ignore emerging markets.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.520]   I don't have a strong opinion on emerging markets.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.360]   My bias would be that those might do better.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   But if you look at developed economies, a few different things.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.400]   One is in general, we're moving towards a society, we've had a two and a half to 3%
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:32.280]   tailwind as an economy from more people being born in most developed countries, especially
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.440]   countries that speak English, that tailwind is starting to reduce.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.920]   In certain countries like Japan, it's become a headwind.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.240]   So it's harder to grow your economy when you're not growing your people.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.360]   The second thing I'd say, if you think about the US kind of where we were 50 or 75 years
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.880]   ago, it's just a different environment than we have today.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.880]   That's one.
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:02.120]   Two, stocks are, this is going to get a little bit technical, I assume it's okay if I get
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   slightly technical.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.120]   >>COREY Go ahead.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   >>JASON All right.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.160]   So when you own a stock, you own a portion of a business and that business has a price
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.640]   attached to it.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.360]   There are X number of shares and so you get a price per share based on the total value
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.840]   of the enterprise and how many shares there are.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.360]   That company, let's assume the company has earnings to make things simple.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.520]   The company has earnings.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.800]   People generally value stocks based on their earnings, not entirely, but let's just make
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.240]   that simplified assumption as well.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.540]   And so when you're investing in the market, which is really just a collection of stocks,
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:48.280]   you have X amount of investment that's producing Y earnings and there's a multiple that's attached
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.280]   to that.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.560]   So let's say for simplicity's sake, that multiple today are different numbers, but let's call
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.320]   it 18.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:02.560]   So I have the stock, I have my index fund, let's just use, I'm going to assume we'll
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.880]   call it S&P, let's assume S&P just to make numbers simple is 100.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:11.720]   So 100, I have, gosh, let's make it even more simple, so 20 times earnings.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.960]   So let's say I have $5 earnings.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.600]   Now over time, the investment grows a few different ways.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:28.480]   One, that earnings can grow so that $5 can go to 510, 525 to the degree that earnings
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.120]   grow and the multiple stays the same, the investment grows.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.320]   Now over time, my impression is that the earnings growth has been, call it 2% or 3% a year.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.680]   So you have that.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:43.200]   Secondly, you have capital return, which in the form of dividends.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.160]   Dividend yield across full stock market right now is something like 2%.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.560]   I think it's varied over time, but let's call it 2%.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.760]   So you have kind of 5% of your return that I actually think you can feel decent about.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.920]   Dividends are what they are.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.920]   And earnings growth over a long period of time, I don't think there's any reason to
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   think that that's changing particularly.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.600]   Now the third factor is the multiple you put on those earnings.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.200]   And that number varies wildly.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.320]   And that number has a huge impact on what your return is going to give in a year.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:21.840]   So simplistically, if you think about certain market environments, so 2009, I think you
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   had that multiple.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.680]   And again, these are going to be rough numbers, illustrative.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.400]   That multiple may have dropped to nine.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.960]   And here we are today, that multiple's call it 18, 19.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.080]   Your return that you've gotten from the quote unquote predictable things, earnings and dividend
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.080]   yields, that's not really...
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.600]   I mean, it's rebounded some, but it's not what's driven the returns.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.480]   What's driven the returns is people instead of willing to pay nine times that number,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.560]   now willing to pay 18 times that number.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.840]   And if you look over a very long period of time, there's an argument that folks make,
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.800]   which is basically you can rely on that call it 5%.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.760]   And that multiple expansion, it's just hard to know, but all else being equal, you're
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.880]   better off when you're buying at a lower stock multiple than when you're buying a higher
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   stock multiple.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.520]   And so very simply, and you can do some math around this, if you assume over, I think,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:18.200]   a 10 year period, that earnings grows, call it 5% a year, or earnings dividend gets you
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.480]   5% return a year, but the multiple falls in half.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.080]   I don't know exactly where that math works out.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.760]   And Josh, I'm sure you can put something together on this, but basically you would end up with
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.920]   something that basically has no return.
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.160]   And so the real variable that moves things a lot isn't actually the underlying performance
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   of the businesses.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.680]   It tends to more be people's feeling or multiple they're willing to ascribe to those earnings.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.440]   And that's what I don't understand about many of the...
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   There are some businesses that I understand that make sense.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.560]   The company is profitable.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.040]   They have a compelling value proposition.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.680]   They have real customers.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   They really work.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.160]   And I would be happy and proud to be a marginal owner of those businesses.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:15.920]   There are other businesses that it seems to me have massive stratospheric desire by investment
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.400]   managers that I just simply don't understand.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.000]   I was looking at Uber recently, and I don't want to...
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.640]   Obviously I don't want to get into individual things, but I'm just looking at this company
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.560]   and saying, massive company that can't seem to make money, basically.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.960]   How do these things happen?
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:37.160]   And you look at so many of the modern companies, I don't know how to connect them to reality.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.080]   And so I don't know if there's something that's broken with me that I'm just old fashioned
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.740]   and we're in a new world where the old rules don't make sense and the goal is to get as
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.760]   big as possible and lose money all the way through as some of the leading companies seem
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.700]   to do, or if there's something old.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:20:00.660]   And so it causes me to be very insecure about decisions like that, especially when then
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.420]   I look at what's happening in the world.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:06.040]   And as you say, the difference between nine and 18 is major.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   If you're going to value things at nine times, that's going to be a very different number
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.100]   than at 18 times.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.420]   But then I look at the world being a wash in money, and it almost seems like do the
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.620]   old rules still apply?
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.620]   I don't know the answer.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.220]   I'm stymied by the problem.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.340]   I don't know the answer either.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:34.220]   And I think what we do as a, this isn't maybe super satisfying, but as a firm, or just as
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.660]   a person, there are certain things I know the answer to and I feel like I'm good at.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.620]   That's analyzing individual stocks.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.340]   There are other things that are a lot more complicated and require a very different skill
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.340]   set.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:51.140]   Like for example, trying to predict where the economy is going or trying to predict
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.500]   the multiple that people will apply to those earnings streams across a broad number of
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.500]   companies.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.660]   That is a totally different skill set.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.420]   I have no idea how to do that.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:06.580]   That said, I can be aware it exists and I can try and carve out a niche for myself where
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:12.740]   I'm focused more on businesses I can understand that have been valued for better or worse
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.380]   somewhat consistently over time.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:20.460]   And so what I would say, the nice thing is at least if you're investing in, I know S&P
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:28.460]   500, some of the bigger indexes, there's also IVN, which I think is the Russell 2000 value
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.740]   index.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.540]   You can avoid some of those stocks.
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.060]   Now there's an argument to me that those stocks are very attractive.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.820]   I'm not going to make that, but I think, look, people can make money a lot of different ways.
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.740]   I mean, there are venture capital firms that invest very early in stuff and have had amazing
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.620]   returns and they literally do like two hours of work before they make a half a million
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:51.820]   or a million dollar investment.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.940]   It's pretty amazing, but you have one success there.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.820]   You find Facebook and it's paid for every mistake you're going to make.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.700]   But look, I mean, ultimately with the stock market, it just gets very complicated when
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.940]   you start to get into little stocks.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:10.780]   I think to the degree that you don't want to bet on eToys in 1999 having a $30 billion
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   valuation and people think it's going to be worth that.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.740]   And if you can find parallels today, the way you avoid that is you basically avoid, to
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:23.620]   the degree the more specific ETFs that have a lot of names like that in them that aren't
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.020]   generating earnings, you can generally avoid those and you do a pretty good job of that
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:34.820]   by choosing more boring indexes like the S&P, Dow, or potentially a value skewed index,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.660]   which there are plenty of.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:43.780]   So do you think that normal people with an above average interest in money should simply
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:49.180]   give up and say, "I'm just going to take market returns," or do you think that normal people
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.100]   with an above average interest in money and investing should seek to become competent
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.500]   DIY investors buying publicly traded securities?
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:03.700]   That's a very good question.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:09.460]   It's really hard to do that, but you can do it.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.860]   But if you're going to do that, it's a job.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:20.540]   To spend two hours a week doing something, you're just not going to be competent at it.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.060]   I don't know, to the degree you're a surgeon, someone tries to be a surgeon a couple hours
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.900]   a week, it's probably not going to go very well.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.780]   And the thing is, if you start to spend that much time on it, I think there are probably...
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.820]   I can only speak to investing, I think it's possible to do.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.460]   I know people that have done it.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.380]   There are probably easier ways to do it than putting your time in stocks.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.940]   So what I would say generally is, look, if you have a 401(k) and that's your option,
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.940]   putting it in ETFs is probably a fine thing to do.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.940]   I think generally you shouldn't make bets about where the market is, even though it's
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.540]   going to have a big impact in returns.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.140]   You just put in the amount that you have every year, you're just 65, you're probably in this
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:09.820]   with something that's okay because that money will be put in over a long period of time.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:16.100]   But to the degree that you can develop a competency in something, whether it be investing or real
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.740]   estate or something else, I think you're going to find, or starting a business, I think you're
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:26.380]   going to find a lot more attractive returns there than you are just putting your money
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.940]   in an ETF.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:35.340]   So let me hone in on something then, because I want to understand the difference between
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.100]   your abilities as a professional hedge fund manager versus mine.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.740]   The thing that bothers me about stock market investing, just to use what I mean is purchasing
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:51.180]   publicly traded securities for large companies.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.140]   The thing that bothers me in trying to choose, do I want to put together a portfolio of blue
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.660]   chip stocks or this kind of thing?
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.420]   What bothers me is I don't see where my competitive advantage is in that market.
[00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.380]   Let's stick with real estate versus stocks.
[00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.420]   I can understand where my competitive market is to find, or my competitive advantage is
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:17.540]   to find a below value property in a neighborhood in my town, because I can understand which
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.300]   neighborhoods are coming up, which neighborhoods are going down.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.460]   And I can go out on a Tuesday evening and drive around with my children in the back
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:30.580]   seat and I can look for houses that look dilapidated, that look like there might be something happening,
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:34.140]   and I can start to go and knock on doors and ask people if they know anyone on the street
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.220]   that they might want to sell their house.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:44.500]   I'm doing work that is in such a tiny market that it's very reasonable that I could be
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:54.300]   one of, if any others, one of only a few other people who are actually canvassing that market.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.940]   But if I go to US listed securities exchanges, there are, I don't know the number, at least
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:06.980]   hundreds of thousands of people who are scouring these same handful of some few thousands of
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.940]   companies and I don't see the competitive advantage I have.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:17.860]   So what do you have as an investor that I don't have sitting at home on Yahoo Finance?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.620]   So it's not higher intellect.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.540]   It's more time and more resources and more focus.
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.500]   So the analogy you have is interesting.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:33.580]   So you said something I think really insightful, which is you can focus on a small neighborhood
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.460]   where you do a lot of work, right?
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.740]   You know the ins and outs of that neighborhood.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.700]   You drive around and do on the ground diligence.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:50.140]   It's not just looking up on Zillow and buying a home in Nebraska when you live in Florida.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.300]   You do it in a neighborhood that you understand.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.820]   Stock investing isn't really too dissimilar.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.860]   So a couple of things I'd say.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:06.140]   One is as a firm, we spend probably about a million dollars a year on research.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.380]   Now that research comes in a couple of different flavors.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.540]   A relatively small amount of it frankly is off the shelf research.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.600]   A fairly large part of it is what would be called proprietary research.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.740]   So for example, if I'm researching a company, and the other thing I'd say just to make it
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:29.380]   simple as well is I'm not going to look at things that a thousand other smart people
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.380]   are looking at.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.540]   I want to look in markets that are inefficient where there's lots of fear.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:40.460]   These tend to be companies that aren't very well followed.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:46.060]   They're not kind of popular household names or if they were popular household names, they
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.980]   no longer are and have a stigma associated with them.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.220]   So first you start going to those areas as you would say that are inefficient.
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:28:00.980]   And the second thing is you throw a lot of intellect and time and money trying to figure
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.300]   out those neighborhoods better than anyone else.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   And that's what we do.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.340]   So as I said, we spend a million dollars a year on research.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.500]   What does that mean?
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:16.060]   That means I do, gosh, I personally probably do about 300 phone calls a year with former
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.980]   employees, competitors, customers, industry experts of businesses we're considering investing
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:21.980]   in.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.100]   What else do we do?
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.580]   I can actually talk to management teams of the companies that we're investing in because
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.700]   we have access to that because we're of a scale that we can do that.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.460]   That can help us well.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.820]   I've been doing this for a long time now.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.860]   So I have tremendous experiential knowledge.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.420]   For example, we do a lot of investing in software.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.300]   I've just have a very good sense of that market.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.500]   I've seen a lot of patterns in terms of why people panic and sometimes sell software stocks
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.300]   that they shouldn't.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.900]   There are whole interesting little things about that that I could talk about endlessly,
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.300]   but just from doing it for a long period of time, you see pattern recognition.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:04.660]   I imagine if you're good at real estate, you would see a set of patterns that would make
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:06.100]   you be attracted in a deal.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   I'm making this up, but maybe it could be someone who's lived in the house for a long
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   time.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.620]   The house is not very well kept.
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.620]   Maybe it's really dirty.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.880]   It's messy, but those are things.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.940]   Maybe they're not using a broker or not using a good broker.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.060]   Maybe it's on the market for a long time.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:28.580]   You just see these patterns of things that tend to result in people that aren't as sophisticated
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.940]   as you haven't done it as much, that they might value those things.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.380]   They might value the dirt on the floor at negative $10,000 on the house.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.940]   Psychologically, you can see how that makes sense.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:46.220]   Realistically, with experience, you can buy a $5 cleaner and fix it with an hour of work.
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.180]   It's not very different than getting good at anything.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:58.620]   I think the challenge with the stock market is it's just like the world's casino.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.060]   People tell you it's investing.
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.260]   I think people convince themselves sometimes investing is actually gambling, and then you
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.860]   get into a whole list of other issues.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:10.180]   But chances are, unless you spend a lot of time on it, unless you have specific knowledge
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.020]   about a company or an industry, you probably don't know what you're doing, and you're probably
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.620]   going to do substantially worse than just an index.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.700]   Let me ask you about risk.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:27.580]   I personally have what I perceive to be a fairly high tolerance for risk.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.660]   Let me define that term in two ways.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.060]   First, volatility.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:39.140]   My personal theory that I practice and encourage others to practice is keep your personal finances
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.980]   separate from your investments in this way.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.220]   I don't know how to control for the volatility of an investment portfolio, but I do know
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:52.420]   how to calculate how much money I need every year and make sure that I have money that's
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.620]   not going to be volatile to provide for my expenses.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:00.580]   So then, in looking at an investment portfolio, if I say this portfolio here is likely to
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:06.820]   be this volatile based upon historical understandings, and so therefore if I keep three years of
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.500]   cash outside of the portfolio, I could afford to leave that portfolio alone completely for
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:17.000]   three years, which would get me through 72.6% of the problems, something like that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.100]   So I segregate investing from personal finance.
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:26.860]   I don't want my life or my lifestyle to be subject to the risk of investment volatility.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.700]   That helps me to be more comfortable with risk.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.960]   A lot of people have this sense, however, that investing in the market is just this
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.420]   intensely risky thing.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:42.460]   I'm a little bit more cavalier about that concept of risk, thinking that somehow if
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.860]   I buy this company, it'll go to zero.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:50.100]   I'm a little cavalier because, one, I think the market is very efficient.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.900]   There are a lot of people who are looking for things, and it's hard to believe that
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.740]   if this company were headed to zero, there wouldn't be some indications of that.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.260]   There are a lot of people trying to find that information out.
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.260]   So yes, there are spectacular bankruptcies.
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.700]   There are spectacular failures that come from nowhere, but those are pretty few and far
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.220]   between compared to the most of the companies that just don't generally do well.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:18.660]   The risk of a company going to zero is very, very modest.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.660]   Companies have a lot of assets.
[00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.100]   Now, it's a little different to look at a company that's very heavily on this whole
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.260]   asset as intellectual property or an idea or an app.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.700]   I don't know what Uber's assets are other than its user base and its app.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:38.020]   I don't seem to see what their moat is that they can put against competition, considering
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:43.540]   that most Uber drivers are running three apps at a time, and most Uber riders also have
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.660]   two or three apps on their phone.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:50.700]   So I don't see what this moat is other than early mover advantage and brand recognition.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.580]   But when I look at a company like, I don't know, my favorite, Walmart, I look at Walmart
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.300]   and I look at it and say, "Man, you've got millions of customers on a global basis.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.860]   You've got diversified streams of income.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.660]   You've got tremendous physical plants, infrastructure, et cetera.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.100]   There's real value here."
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.540]   And so no matter what, obviously that value needs to be properly assessed based upon the
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.240]   formula of earnings, profitability, et cetera, and some multiple.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.900]   But this is not that risky.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.900]   So I'm not worried.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.420]   If the dollar plummets, here's a company that earns money in all kinds of currencies all
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.600]   around the world.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   So I just don't see large companies or reasonable companies with professional management as
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   all that risky.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:37.200]   It seems far riskier to me to own a house on the corner that could be wiped out by a
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.440]   zoning change or could be wiped out by a law change or something like that than it does
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.840]   to own shares of a large global corporation.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   Where am I wrong?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.640]   What am I missing in that kind of ambivalence about risk?
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.760]   Well, so the first thing you said is something I wholeheartedly agree with.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.440]   So even though I can get very attractive returns on my funds, it's not particularly useful
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.560]   if I have to dip into that.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.160]   At definition, it would probably be the worst time.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.600]   If the market's down a lot, funds down a lot, I'm not making so much income.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   I might have to dip into savings to do that.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.560]   So having cash just provides a buffer that allows you to never have to call yourself
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.560]   out.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   So that totally makes sense.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.280]   I think you're also generally correct.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.880]   Look, the more businesses you have, the things that that's harder to...
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.200]   If you buy Walmart, you're not really buying one business.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:30.640]   You're buying one type of business all over the world and such that one thing can go bad
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.960]   in one region and you could still probably be okay.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:41.000]   That said, simplistically, I would not take much of any comfort in any signaling just
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.200]   because it's a big company you've heard of and the stock's gone up or other things like
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   that.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:55.880]   I think it's probably safer, but you'd be surprised at the level of...
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   Enron, for example, there are lots of examples of those companies.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.600]   Valiant, all different kinds of companies that we're seeing as these big, good companies
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.960]   that end up having a lot of issues that you wouldn't be able to diagnose logically, sometimes
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   outright fraud or anything like that.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   So in general, even being a professional investor, spending tremendous amounts of time on every
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:21.680]   company research, we typically in our portfolio don't have more than 5% of the portfolio in
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   one investment.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.320]   Personally, when I did things myself, I had my own portfolio, I'd be comfortable going
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.000]   to 10 to 15, but even in that case, it'd be things that I knew tremendously.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.080]   I would never make the assumption that just because a company is big and has professional
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.480]   management and it has a stock price with a big valuation that it's safe.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:48.520]   I can give a bunch of examples of that, but maybe another way to tackle this is within
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.880]   the investment community, there are lots of people that have very different jobs.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:58.520]   So why individual investor or why small firms can actually do quite well in the market is
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.560]   due to a whole host of structural issues with the way investments are managed.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.920]   So if you think about the stock market and the investors in it, right now you have, I
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:14.440]   don't know if the numbers did 25 or 30% of money, which literally just goes into whatever
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.840]   stocks are in an index in the composition that they happen to be in.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.720]   There's no lens of value, there's no lens of interesting things happening in the business.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:29.840]   It is just formulaically put to work in indices, which is actually creating more opportunities
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.280]   for people that can do a lot of work.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:38.520]   You then have the vast majority of money that's managed, which is managed still by mutual
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.760]   funds or institutional investors.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:47.800]   Making these numbers up, let's call it 30% ETFs and then you have 60% mutual funds.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.560]   Those mutual funds get compensated almost entirely on a percent of assets.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.920]   They don't get rewarded very much for doing substantially better than the market because
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.280]   they don't get a percent of profits, they just get their management fee.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.160]   They want to do just well enough not to be fired.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:08.960]   And so those people basically try and track the market and make some small adjustments
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.080]   around the edges to try and maybe outperform it by 50 or 100 basis points.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.640]   But in reality, a lot of them don't do that and so they'll tend to lag by roughly their
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.640]   fees.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:25.440]   And then you have a much smaller portion of the market with people that are getting paid
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:32.120]   substantially more as a percent of the assets they manage with tremendous incentives to
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.080]   find stocks that perform and to have no correlation.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:42.560]   And those people are throwing massive amounts of resources and employees at companies that
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.600]   other people aren't looking at in detail.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.280]   So I can't tell you how many times I go to conferences or other things like that and
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.840]   you just see people that, you know, there's one analyst maybe who covers 100 stocks and
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.400]   covers 100 stocks.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.200]   Each one is a 50 basis point position or 25 basis point position for the company he works
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   for.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:11.020]   No matter how smart that person is, you just can't divide your time in such a way to be
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.600]   expert on 100 companies.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:19.440]   And he can be expert on like 10 or 12 or 13 at any one time.
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.480]   And so the math just becomes very unfavorable.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.960]   So what you have to have happen is occasionally you'll see these spectacular failures where
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.120]   the businesses were owned by a whole host of people.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.160]   It was seen as a very safe company.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.200]   And lo and behold, the thing goes under.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   Now, interestingly, in many cases that that happens, I'd argue in most cases that that
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:47.360]   happens, there are short sellers that tend to be employed, hedge funds that are doing
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.440]   work trying to uncover frauds or businesses that have presented themselves in one way
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.720]   that actually aren't what they think, what they make themselves to be.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.760]   And in most cases, we have this spectacular failures.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.320]   You have people like me that will be betting on them failing because they've uncovered
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:12.200]   through massive amounts of on the ground diligence, other things of that nature might find a fraud
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.680]   that's there that people have missed.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.320]   So I think it's very dangerous to ever have assume any investment is inherently safe.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.840]   Certainly there are ones that are going to be more safe than others, but there's that,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.640]   there's leverage, there's all different kinds of factors that come into play that might
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.200]   not be obvious unless you do this as a Russian.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:36.160]   And you very briefly there at the very end alluded to just even all the different tools
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:44.560]   and different ways of playing a hunch or playing a bet, whether that bet is up, down, all of
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:50.440]   the ways to ensure your bet, et cetera, which are effective, but are largely opaque to a
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.120]   retail investor.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.740]   Here's what bugs me, which I want to try to figure out how to do.
[00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:04.660]   To your comments, it seems to me from having sort of worked in the investment business,
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:13.160]   there is, I don't know what cliche to spout out here, but you won't get, what was the
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   old thing about IBM?
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.600]   They said you won't get fired if you choose IBM.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:20.000]   Basically, it's a safe choice.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.360]   Yeah, it might not do very well, but you're not going to get fired.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.400]   And as you just pointed out, in the investment business, the majority of people are just
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.040]   trying not to get fired.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:39.320]   And even though at this point in time, I have no allegiance, I have no conflict of interest,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:48.240]   I have nothing that is in any way to my opinions, I still don't want to get fired.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.520]   I still don't want to make a crazy prediction that turns out to be wrong.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.480]   And so I always go back to, "Index funds are safe.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.040]   How can I be the guy that says, 'No, you should try to go and find John Medford and
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.120]   invest in his hedge fund because this is too important.'"
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.560]   And I run the math and I quietly do things myself in my own private life, but when it
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.660]   comes time to putting my reputation on the line, then it's very hard to put my reputation
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:17.080]   on the line for something that's not safe, that's not deniable, that I couldn't defend.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.960]   Now at every level of the investment business, you have the same thing.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.400]   If I were, when I was a financial advisor actively managing money, you had exactly the
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.680]   same thing.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:34.640]   You would get very little return for a massive outperformance if there were some way for
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.480]   an individual retail advisor to provide massive outperformance.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:45.240]   You get very little return, but you'll suffer massively if you're out of line with the benchmarks
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.880]   by too much of a degree.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.520]   Because you can at least defend how, "Well, we're in line with everything's down.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.200]   Yeah, your portfolio is down, but look, look at what the S&P 500 is doing and you can see
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.920]   that we're actually doing only a little bit worse or only a little bit better."
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.480]   And then as you say, at the mutual fund, you have the mutual fund managers, the portfolio
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.500]   managers, basically every single level.
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:10.520]   So about the only people who have enough incentive seem to be guys like you, hedge fund managers,
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:17.760]   where there's enough upside that you have the incentive to swing for the fences for
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:24.680]   returns to invest the money, but the press is so bad and I don't know how to find you.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:32.760]   So how do I find you is the point and how do I find a good you, not a loser?
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:38.600]   So you would be substantially better off, anyone would be substantially better off,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:45.760]   I think, investing in the average ETF or investing in the average mutual fund than investing
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.040]   in the average hedge fund.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.880]   And the reason for this is very simple.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.440]   If you are a mutual fund, you're just not going to veer that far from the market.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.040]   You're going to, they charge 1%, they're not going to swing for the fences, they're also
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.280]   not going to destroy you.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.280]   Hedge funds have a terrible reputation.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.400]   There are lots of types of hedge funds.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.200]   There are lots of hedge funds, I have no idea what they do or how they make money.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.720]   There are lots of hedge funds that are terrible.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.760]   There are lots of hedge funds run by miserable people.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.720]   There are lots of hedge funds run by actually, I think, quite good people.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.560]   Hedge fund is just a fee structure and a legal structure.
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.520]   So hedge fund is different, but the axiom used to be you charge a 2% management fee
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.720]   and then 20% of profits.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.960]   That number has come down some.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.120]   There are lots of flavors of that.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.000]   When you have an incentive structure like that, you can imagine the amount of resources
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.280]   and incentives someone has to try and perform.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.720]   At the same time, you wake up January 1st every year and you know you have to outperform
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:50.200]   whatever your benchmark is by 2% until you even start to compare to them.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:55.600]   And so it's logical to think, again, it's just a fee structure.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.040]   People often choose hedge fund managers like they choose any investor, they choose them
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.760]   on the big names that they don't think they'll get fired for.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.200]   And lo and behold, the investor at the average hedge fund is probably better than the average
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.640]   investor at a mutual fund.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.160]   But I'm not sure it justifies the fee differential.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.560]   And so if you look at hedge fund indices, the hedge fund indices are even worse than
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.120]   mutual funds in aggregate.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.120]   But what that masks is a smaller subset of funds that happen to be very good.
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.960]   Now, how do you find that?
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.840]   Look, it's hard.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.880]   I mean, I don't know you're looking for any life hacks.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.600]   The reality is almost definitionally, I would argue, it has to be a smaller fund.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.800]   I would say it has to be a fund that's somewhere between kind of $50 million and $1 billion.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:47.000]   Ideally, it would be one where most of the capital is capital partners that has been
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.400]   in business for a few years that seems to care more about compounding their own money
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.840]   than growing their business.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.120]   Most common things that happens in hedge funds, hopefully this won't happen to us, but it
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.680]   has happened with most of them out there.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.360]   If you don't close to your investors and you keep getting bigger, it becomes harder and
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.800]   harder to generate good returns.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.360]   But there's a massive incentive to do that because every dollar you take in generally
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.000]   just falls to the bottom line.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.240]   And so what tends to happen is the folks that are good grow, and they pretty much keep growing
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:27.040]   until they're no longer any good, or they're just trying to not get fired because now their
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.800]   incentives are to swing for the fences and generate good returns to hold on to their
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.520]   money empire that they built.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.320]   So it's exceptionally difficult.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.720]   In my case, it's like anything.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.560]   I imagine if you're doing real estate investing, you run into people in your neighborhood and
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.680]   you know that this person is really talented.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.880]   I don't know a way to do that other than being an expert in what you do.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:56.260]   So if you're not an expert in stocks, you probably shouldn't try and find me or anyone
[00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.920]   that's good because you're not going to know what to look for.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.840]   Whereas if you're looking in something you know a lot about, real estate or whatever
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.240]   it happens to be, you're probably going to be a better judge of that.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.400]   And I'd say given how expensive hedge funds are, I would dissuade anyone from thinking
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.960]   that the average hedge fund is going to be good.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:15.920]   The average hedge fund is terrible.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:20.440]   It just comes down to if you find people that are good in a niche, have a good track record
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:26.680]   of doing that, are trustworthy, are honest, seem to make sense, what they do make sense.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.920]   You can understand, they can explain to you how they make money.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   That's a good starting point.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   But I just think it's very hard to do that unless you have the knowledge.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:40.200]   Well, at the very least, you are basically affirming the way that I've affected it or
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:48.220]   addressed it in the sense that I can't deny the academic data on the whole, but I also
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:53.640]   can't deny the individual examples that are there, but I can't tell you how to get them.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.320]   So you basically said what I say, which is things are largely efficient.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.680]   The safe solution is buy an ETF, Eaton Dex fund.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.120]   And yet that doesn't mean that outperformance is not possible.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.600]   I just don't know necessarily how to tell you to get there.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.440]   You repeated what I have repeated, right?
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.640]   We pretty much agree?
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:18.700]   Look, if you want to talk for two hours about everything that we do that's different, I
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.700]   can start to give a clearer sense of that.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.700]   But I assume that'd be true of anyone that does anything well.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.140]   The conclusion I have from this is less anything related to stocks.
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.820]   I think the thing that gets me excited is exactly what you said.
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.540]   You chose an example in your life where you feel like you can get an advantage because
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.660]   you live in the area, you know the neighborhood, you know that.
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:45.340]   And if you dedicate time to it, you can probably do substantially better than that than the
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:52.140]   average person who probably is trying to find a new place to live, has time pressure, has
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.460]   work, isn't just focused on it the way you are.
[00:47:55.460 --> 00:48:00.340]   And so for me, the conclusion isn't, frankly, the conclusion is more you should find something
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.540]   where you feel like you have an advantage and put your money there.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.260]   And I don't think that's stocks unless you devote yourself to it.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:09.100]   Now, obviously stocks are easy and realistically for a lot of people, it's one of the easiest
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   ways to spend money.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.460]   But if you want to have great returns, probably not going to be an ETF.
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:17.180]   It's probably going to be doing something that you become expert in where you look at
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.060]   the other people doing it and you understand why you have an advantage.
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:26.820]   >>AJ: I've been disconnected from the professional world of money, anything, no licenses, no
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.500]   anything for I think almost five years now.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:36.060]   And over those years, I have really tried to ask myself, what do I believe now that
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.700]   I still believe that I believed then?
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:45.500]   Now that enough of my loyalties and allegiances and conflicts of interest and whatnot have
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.140]   dissipated, what did I fool myself?
[00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.540]   What did I think I believed then, but I only believed in it because it was buttering my
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.540]   bread?
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:59.420]   And one of the things that I believed then, but I didn't know necessarily how to articulate,
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:06.580]   was basically that you shouldn't look to investing, if we think of investing as buying something
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.480]   like just buying a Roth IRA and putting stocks in there, you shouldn't look at that as the
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.100]   path to wealth because you don't have a competitive advantage.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.900]   You're not knowledgeable about the market and you don't have enough money to make a
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:18.900]   difference.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:23.900]   So if you're only making a $5,000 investment, that $5,000, you can probably find something
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:24.900]   in your personal life.
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:25.900]   I don't know what it is.
[00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.580]   Maybe it's solar panels on your roof.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.480]   Maybe it's cash for your next car.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.580]   Maybe it's discounts on bulk buying of your groceries.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.200]   Maybe it's a discount on new equipment for your business or something.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.560]   You could probably find a better way close to you to put $5,000 than in the stock market.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.280]   Same thing when we go up at $50,000 or $100,000 or a few hundred thousand dollars.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.960]   If you've got $100,000, you can start to get, you can swing your weight around very effectively
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.460]   in your local community.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:58.040]   You can find enough opportunities where you can really get outperformance.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.280]   But then you face a problem where it's hard to invest your capital more and more.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.600]   You get to a million and millions of dollars.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.360]   Unless you're an established entrepreneur or a very experienced investor who's willing
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.740]   to buy a 20-unit apartment building or something like that, it gets hard to invest significant
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.520]   amounts of money.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:23.560]   And I think that's where, just speaking generally, the stock market can easily absorb a million
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   dollars.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.480]   The stock market can easily absorb $5 million without becoming a problem.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:34.580]   Now a billion dollars is very hard to invest, but a million dollars can make a big difference.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.840]   And so somebody who has a million, somebody who has a couple million, can easily come
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:44.720]   to a modestly-sized firm or something like yours where you're not managing a $100 billion
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   portfolio.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.680]   You can come in and there are then those opportunities for outperformance.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.040]   And it's almost like the next logical step.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:56.320]   You keep outgrowing one market and you've got to figure out how to get into another
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   market.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:05.000]   And to me, that seems like the best value, the best argument in favor of working with
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.400]   somebody like you.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.920]   Now that's not to deny – go ahead and respond to that.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   >>Trevor: Yeah.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.280]   So it's interesting because I would hate for people to take away from this.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.640]   It's actually possible to beat the market if you can only find the right person.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.480]   Look, you shouldn't trust anything I'm saying.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:25.960]   I'm an anonymous person and there's no reason to trust this.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.240]   You have to use your own judgment as to whether or not I'm making sense.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.480]   But you don't want to – there are so many people that have such strong incentives to
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:40.120]   convince you that they do something special that's going to get you more money than putting
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.200]   an index on.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:50.040]   I go back to it, unless you're an expert in stocks or in choosing managers or have really
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:54.120]   strong personal recommendations from people who actually work in the industry that you
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:59.840]   think are competent, I would generally just put money in ETFs, especially if you have
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   a lot of money.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.680]   Look, if you have a lot of money, if you have two, three, four, five million dollars, your
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:08.320]   expenses are modest, you don't need to return 10%.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.880]   If you want to maximize your wealth, maybe you do, but you'd be perfectly fine with something
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   that's boring.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.200]   You put it in an ETF, you know no one's going to steal it from you, you know that no one
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.680]   is going to have sold you a pipe dream that they won't be able to deliver.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:30.040]   It is really hard to outperform the market and most people that do it, you've never heard
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.000]   of.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.520]   And if they claim they do and you have heard of them, in many cases they're lying because
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:44.880]   the people that are slickest salesmen tend to be, it tends to be an inverse correlation.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.160]   Most people I know that outperform the market have modest forms of Asperger's syndrome and
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   autism.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.800]   They are people that can function very well in the real world, which is why they spend
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.000]   all their days reading 10Ks.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.800]   The person, for years I read Joshua Kennan's website and he writes a lot less now that
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.000]   he and his partner have launched a fund.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.840]   But I used to read his website and he was such a good writer that I thought this is
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.960]   an insight into somebody who, I don't think he's autistic, but into somebody who's just
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   a freak.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.260]   Like he likes this stuff and it convinced me to entirely walk away from any interest
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:29.760]   in market investing because the kind of person, I would imagine you, John, the kind of person
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.360]   that enjoys this stuff is weird.
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.560]   You're weird and you enjoy things that most people don't enjoy.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.280]   Now my interests are totally weird, but they're weird in my direction.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:48.960]   And so I think the key is to recognize what your interest is in.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.420]   I don't want to read 10Ks, but I love reading tax law.
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.320]   It's weird, but that's my thing.
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   So I want to pivot here.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.160]   I didn't tell you I was going to do this, but I want to ask you about your personal
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.440]   financial advancement.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:07.400]   Not asking you for all the details, just simply pointing out the path that you have taken
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.860]   towards wealth.
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.760]   Did you come from a wealthy family?
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   Yes.
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760]   Okay.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.200]   And how did your parents invest in you?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   What worked and what didn't?
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:30.320]   They paid for my education, which I'm eternally grateful for.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.680]   What did that education look like?
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:34.680]   Four-year university.
[00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.080]   I have no graduate degree at all.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.400]   I don't think it's useful.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.760]   Was it elite, Ivy League?
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.080]   Was it general, mass market?
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.760]   It was slightly below Ivy League.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:47.240]   It was a very good school, but not actually much of a brand name.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:51.560]   And how did that benefit you?
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.360]   I met really interesting people and found things I'm passionate about, and I had space
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   to do that.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.080]   I didn't take a class that changed my life or allowed me to.
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.040]   I think it was just the social environment.
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:04.040]   I met fascinating people.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.880]   I had room to explore what I wanted to do.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.920]   The other thing my parents did, so they had set aside money for college, I had expressed
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   an interest in stock investing.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   I've generally been prudent and conservative over time.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:18.400]   They, when I turned 21, there was still money left in that account.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.240]   They turned it over to me and they told me, "This is it.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.440]   You can invest it, but if you mess it up, there's not more."
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.560]   And that started, and I put a lot of time and effort.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.480]   I think my junior or senior year of college, I just consumed everything I could, really,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.600]   at the stocks.
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   Got lucky, frankly.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.160]   I don't think I was particularly good.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.960]   Got lucky, I think it was 2003, which happened to be the bottom of the stock market cycle.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:50.720]   And lo and behold, 2005, I have the same amount of money in the account that I had when I
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.720]   was a junior.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:57.280]   I also decided to go part-time my senior year, which saved me 20 grand.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:04.000]   And I came out of college with a couple hundred thousand dollars in an account, and that started
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.200]   to compound my whole life.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.760]   And then I was exceptionally frugal for a very long period of time.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   Why were you frugal?
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   How did you learn that?
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   Who taught you that?
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.800]   This is interesting, actually.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.880]   My father was a very successful entrepreneur.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:30.800]   He built a business that, at one point, was worth, I don't know, $50 or $100 million,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.800]   and he owned maybe 20% of that.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:37.160]   And we had a very nice lifestyle.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.400]   We had a big house, and I never understood why we had a big house, because there was
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.880]   half the house we didn't use, and it just made no sense to me.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.120]   I don't know why that appealed to me, but it was.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:50.560]   And then something happened such that that business imploded, and he went from having
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.360]   lots of paper wealth to not very much.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:57.600]   Sorry, lots of paper wealth to still lots of paper wealth, but not as much as he was
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   used to having.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.840]   And then that paper wealth was invested very poorly, and he was left with half of that.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.880]   And he was still in a good place, but nowhere near what he was.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.240]   And for lack of a better word, it just got him depressed for about 15 years until things
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.360]   kind of finally got better.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:16.000]   And so I just grew up assuming bad things would happen.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   So I didn't have a pretty simplistic person.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.640]   I had things I like and I need.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.760]   I'm not particularly social seeking, data seeking.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.800]   I just like the food I like.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.800]   I wear clothes until they have big holes in them that are unsightly.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.360]   I'm just the way I am.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.680]   And as time went on, I've had to learn to spend money.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:40.520]   I mean, I married a wife who is very frugal herself, and that's just kind of the way I
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.840]   did it, but it wasn't really a choice.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   It was just the natural consequence of probably seeing what happened to my parents, who weren't,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.840]   by the way, very frugal at all.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.360]   Yeah, but I don't know how that happened.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:55.480]   I'm not sure it was them that instilled that in me as much as it was just me watching what
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.320]   happened to my family as they rode up and down with wealth.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.280]   Well, to me, it's obvious.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.880]   Sometimes we learn from somebody training us and us believing the person, that the person
[00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:11.060]   who's training us knows what they're talking about and choosing to obey them.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:15.280]   Sometimes we learn just by simply watching an unfortunate example, example of disaster
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.440]   or catastrophe or just malaise and saying, "Hey, I see the problem.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.020]   I don't want to repeat that."
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:27.640]   And it sounds like your personal example was a negative example, not a bad, but just simply,
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:29.880]   "Oh, that wasn't a good thing.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.720]   If my parents had been more frugal, then they wouldn't have experienced such severe depression
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.480]   when their wealth was severely diminished."
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.680]   Then when you got into the investment marketplace, you graduated from college, you were managing,
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.600]   in essence, a couple hundred thousand dollars of your own money, addicted to it.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.840]   When did you decide to go into that field professionally and what was your path into
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.840]   it?
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.840]   It's unusual.
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:59.560]   I decided it wasn't the right thing for me.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:03.520]   And lo and behold, I went back to...
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.440]   I didn't have any hedge funds at that time.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.960]   There weren't any that were hiring.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.160]   When I then came back into the market, which was not in a good economic environment, and
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:24.000]   then I just kind of was scrappy and I started writing on a blog some of my investing ideas
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.920]   and the work I was doing.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.440]   And someone read it who managed money and he gave me a job.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   He first offered me my salary, which I believe was $32,000 a year.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.600]   I got him up a little bit, but not much.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.120]   And I just kind of grinded it out.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   I was really scrappy.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:44.120]   I moved on from there to another firm that I met by working there.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:49.240]   I did a lot of in-depth stock research, loved talking to people.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   I just networked a bunch.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.440]   I don't call it networking.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.440]   I just love investing and it's very fun for me to talk to people and I like talking to
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.440]   people that are good at it.
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.480]   So over time, I would talk to people that were good at it and some of them would think
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.040]   I was good and some of them would think I wasn't.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.560]   And the ones that thought I was good and I thought they were good and I thought they
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.520]   were reasonable people, we would connect and chat and we'd then occasionally make money
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.440]   together and lo and behold, what happened with my career, it's not worth going into
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.560]   too much detail on and I don't want to reveal myself, but I ended up meeting someone through
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:24.840]   that process that I then joined in his business.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.320]   And I happen to think he was very good.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   I walked away from a more lucrative job to take a chance on a startup.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:37.560]   I bet on the team that we had at the time of which I was a big part and he was a big
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:41.000]   part and things went well.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   And they continue to go well.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.280]   At some point, they won't go well, but basically, I was at more established firms and then found
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:51.280]   an entrepreneurial opportunity where I wanted to make a bet and take a swing and that's
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.280]   what I did.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:01:00.240]   >>Corey: And so people who are in similar jobs like yours with similar responsibilities
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:06.520]   like you have would earn on average about how much per year at this point in time?
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.000]   >>Jeremy: It varies dramatically depending on the fund size.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.640]   I mean, I can give some illustrative-
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   >>Corey: Just range.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.640]   >>Jeremy: Yeah.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.480]   Look, so if you're a partner, if you're the founder of call it a billion dollar hedge
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:29.560]   fund, in an average year, you probably make 10 to $20 million.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.880]   That's if you're the founder.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:40.760]   If you are a partner that has been with the firm for a while, it depends at the place,
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:48.000]   but call it anywhere between $1 to $5 million depending on the fund and individual performance.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.640]   That's kind of at partner level and then investment analyst level can be very good as well depending
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.840]   on how your ideas go and how generous the person in charge is.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:02.160]   >>Corey: So my point is not to probe too deeply on your personal experience, but to point
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:09.480]   out as a financial planner how incredibly valuable your path is.
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.400]   Because at this point, and about how many years out of college are you?
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.480]   >>Jeremy: Between 10 to 15.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.760]   >>Corey: Okay.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:25.480]   So 10 to 15 years out of college, you have come from a place where, let's just say you're
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.120]   making, what was the number you said, $32,000, right?
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:36.560]   So you started with varying experiences, but $32,000 to earning in excess of 10 times that
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.840]   today in 10 to 15 years.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:44.640]   But yet you're in a business where it aligns with your personal interests, gives you enough
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.040]   ownership, enough autonomy to be connected with so that you can live your life.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.000]   But this is what you did when it was just your own interest.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.960]   But yet you found a way to make a lot of money that way.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:00.720]   And this is the perfect example of for somebody like you, it's a win-win-win because you are
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.240]   investing your own money in your own firm.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:11.680]   Thus, you have the opportunity to earn basically the gross number of 18% basically, instead
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.160]   of 12.5%.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:18.440]   But you're also generating enormous fees for yourself on your management of other people's
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   money.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:24.600]   So your income from here can basically increase, assuming that you don't mess it all up, it
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.640]   can basically increase almost exponentially over the coming decades.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.840]   And yet it's well aligned with something that you are interested in.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.280]   So I point that out because what I have observed is the most important examples for us generally
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.400]   to look at in personal finance are people's career paths and how their money and their
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.360]   career are interrelated.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.920]   Not just on how do I find the best hedge fund manager or how do I find somebody to get me
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.200]   a lot of money in my portfolio, but who are the people who are doing it most effectively.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.560]   And so you're in a business where you risked relatively little in terms of capital, but
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:05.320]   you exerted yourself in interest and in study and for years built up and accumulated the
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:10.640]   benefit of that and then parlayed that into a place where you have exponential returns.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.880]   Because the returns that you can get from managing other people's money where you can
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:19.440]   generate as you say, an extra one to $15 million of annual fees based upon whether you're a
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   partner or founder of a hedge fund.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.560]   But when you can generate a million dollars per year reliably and consistently, and be
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:30.120]   doing that while you're simultaneously investing your money, then you're in the stratosphere
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.720]   of opportunities for wealth.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:36.320]   Now many of us have opportunities similar to that, but it's important to understand
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:37.320]   what's happening.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.800]   It was the same thing I tried to show people when I was a financial advisor.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.200]   The financial advisor doesn't get, the retail financial advisor doesn't become wealthy because
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.000]   they give excellent financial, give great investment advice.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.320]   That's the biggest misconception that the financial advice industry has successfully
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.380]   sold to people.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:59.820]   The financial advisor gets wealthy because they accumulate a set of knowledge and then
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:08.380]   they build, they use the, they borrow the assets of other people to generate profit.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.520]   So as a financial advisor borrows money from other people, says I'll manage this money
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.980]   for you, generates fees, and those fees then go to the financial advisor's bottom line
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.220]   and then they generate income, they pay for some expenses out of it and then they invest
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.060]   the money hopefully themselves.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:27.580]   Hedge fund managers do the same thing but on a much bigger scale, but then you can do
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.940]   the same thing at a smaller scale.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.540]   I used to have, Curtis Stone was on the show a couple years ago and he borrows people's
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.100]   backyards and uses them to generate lots of money.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:40.340]   So the key thing is if you really want to grow wealthy, you've got to find ways to leverage
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.940]   equity including the equities that most people don't see and how do you use other people's
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.860]   money, other people's skills, other people's talents in a way that enriches you but provides
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.160]   a useful and important service to them.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:58.980]   So does that make anything to add, John, from your inside experience to that?
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.820]   I can only speak to what I do.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:07.060]   I feel incredibly fortunate to live in a society that massively overvalues what I do economically
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:11.580]   and to enjoy doing it, to have a life that is good from that.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.900]   I have a lot of concerns and things I'm not good at.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   Thankfully this is now my life.
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:21.460]   I don't have to worry about it as much but I hope that people can find things, at the
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.460]   very least, that are fulfilling.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:26.700]   I mean I'd probably do this even if I made quite a bit of money just because I like it
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:32.100]   but that I can have the other benefits is certainly attractive and unusual.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.900]   I appreciate your humility.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:38.140]   I'm not trying to push you too far out but just trying to show that to my audience because
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.140]   here's what I see.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:42.300]   We're in 2019.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:50.580]   The niche that I'm doing right now is something that could hardly have happened 20 years ago
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:58.820]   but yet the number of specialized areas of knowledge and skill 20 years from now is going
[01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:04.580]   to be incredibly exponentially higher than today, exponentially higher.
[01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:07.980]   And we're in a world of increasing specialization.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.980]   And so if somebody understands the blueprint of basically how these things work, how does
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:19.460]   somebody go the path that you have gone, then they can see the clues and yet apply it in
[01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:21.500]   a totally different scenario.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.300]   So that's all I'm trying to point out is this is the personal finance lesson.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.900]   We're in a world of increasing specialization.
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.740]   All of our careers will become increasingly specialized so we need to understand the pattern
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.420]   so we can recognize them.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.980]   You apply pattern recognition in stock investing.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.380]   We all need to do that in our own careers.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.820]   I was just trying to use the example to show you.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.700]   John, that's all the questions I have.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.580]   Is there anything that I've missed that I should have asked you about that you really
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.660]   wish I had touched on?
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:52.060]   No, I don't think so.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.980]   Maybe a couple random things.
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:59.620]   I would say one is things are much more complicated than they seem in the high level.
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:06.620]   I would argue there are lots of not very good people that run hedge funds in the same way
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:09.820]   there are lots of many not good people who do all different kinds of things.
[01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:17.420]   I happen to think there's a part of the community of hedge fund investors that are curious,
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:22.660]   passionate people that like finding the truth and enjoy being in a profession where they
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:27.180]   can get rewarded for being right and taking chances.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:28.780]   Is it saving the planet?
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:32.460]   Is it the most meaningful thing one can do for society?
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:35.020]   No, I would argue it's not actively bad.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:41.100]   I can make an argument it's modestly beneficial but I think the reputation that the whole
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.700]   industry has gotten as a whole is inflated.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:50.220]   I think the only other thing I'd just say too just to make sure and know in certain
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.460]   terms it's really hard to outperform the stock market in general.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:59.180]   I don't know in good conscience how to advise someone to do that themselves or to find someone
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:04.100]   that could do it without doing it as a profession and becoming an expert at it.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:09.340]   So ETFs are probably the best thing to do.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.700]   Probably the best thing to do but frankly probably the best thing if you want to do
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.860]   stocks but probably the best thing to do is to find whatever example is in your life something
