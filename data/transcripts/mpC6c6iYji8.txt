[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   sexy. Can you can you come outside your window and I'm
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.840]   going to start waving and you see me you want to see me?
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.680]   Zach have two of your butlers hold you up on their shoulders.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.560]   I hope this is being taped and part of the show because this
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   is great.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.480]   David, you're wearing blue shorts, right? Yeah. Yeah, I saw
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.400]   you. Did you see me?
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.040]   Not in see you? Where are you?
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.200]   When you look out on the first house, the pink house? Look at
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.280]   this house. You see that?
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.760]   I heard you. I couldn't see you though.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.720]   yelling like a lunatic. You're the pink house. Look, I'm right
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.080]   below me or above me.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   No, I'm like to your right. If you're looking at I'm at your
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.520]   right. Your first house on the right. Oh, there. Oh, I see. I
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.800]   see you. I see you guys are like 12 year olds. Come over
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.080]   afterwards. We'll have a glass. Okay. All right. I'm coming. I'm
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.120]   gonna come over afterwards.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.840]   Vivek has a hard stop. We should go.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.200]   Rain Man David.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:11.240]   All right, Vivek Ramaswamy is finally on the program. He's an
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.120]   entrepreneur. He graduated Harvard. Yeah, all that kind of
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.840]   stuff. He was an entrepreneur, then a capital allocator. I
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.560]   think broad strokes, everybody knows he's a conservative
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.400]   running as a Republican. He's anti woke. He's pro life
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.520]   anti affirmative action, pro free speech. And he wants
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.080]   federal government term limits. And his fans are lunatics.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.040]   They've been asking for him to be on the all in podcast every
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.760]   day. I've gotten about 300 emails from your fans. Welcome
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.400]   to the program.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.520]   They sound like your fans, actually, because I hear it all
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.040]   the time. It's like blaming me for why I have not been on this
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.760]   program. And so you guys, this has been like some sort of
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   idealized experience for me. I'm looking forward to it.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.000]   Okay, great. So what we try to do here is have a real
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.160]   conversation, try to get these candidates off their talking
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.960]   points. So this isn't meet the press, obviously want to talk to
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   you like a human being. So the extent that you know, as a
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.600]   politician, now you can talk like a human being the audience
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.240]   and we would appreciate it. Meet David Sachs, Chamath Palihapitiya
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080]   and David Friedberg. Vivek, why don't you explain maybe your
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.840]   background as a capital allocator and as an entrepreneur
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.040]   and then why you chose to run for president at this time?
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.040]   Yeah, sure. I mean, my parents, like many people, you probably
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.800]   also know who've had similar success stories, they came to
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.360]   this country with almost no money. I went on to actually
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.680]   found successful companies. And so I started my career as a
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.040]   biotech investor. I worked at a hedge fund in New York when I
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880]   graduated in 2007. I thought I was going to be a scientist. I
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   studied molecular biology, ended up enjoying my time as an
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.680]   internship at a hedge fund a lot more than that. So I did that
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.880]   for seven years. Three of those years, I spent law school at the
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.840]   same time. But then when I finished law school, I had, you
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.920]   know, I think felt like my learning curve had flattened
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.760]   from being a pure capital allocator. So I stepped down and
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.760]   founded a new kind of biotech company that I could, actually,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   you guys might be more interested in it than most of my
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.040]   political audiences. But the basic premise was give
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.520]   scientists skin in the game in the projects they actually work
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   on. So if you're a GSK or advisor, or whatever, Merck, you
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.600]   discover a drug or you develop it, you don't have personal
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.920]   upside in the individual drug that you develop. You do have
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.240]   various forms of asymmetric downside. And so people don't
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.960]   take risks unless they're the same risks that the other pharma
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.000]   companies are taking. Because if you take the same risk and fail,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.480]   but everybody else is failing in a therapeutic category at the
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.720]   same time, you're safe. But if you take a risk that other
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.520]   people aren't willing to take and you fail, then you
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.160]   experience budget cuts, maybe job security risks, social
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.960]   embarrassment, which is a big factor in big pharma as well,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.680]   which in turn created an opportunity that I took
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.560]   advantage of, which was that there were systematically
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.840]   categories of drugs that went undeveloped, even after big
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.920]   pharma had for a long time, spent a lot of money developing
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.960]   those drugs up to a certain point. So I built a business
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   called Royven, basically in licensed some of those drugs in
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.800]   their early stages of development, phase one or phase
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.480]   two, often for pennies on the dollar relative to what had gone
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.280]   into them. Often, we would have scientists or drug developers
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   who are passionate about that very project inside the
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.400]   companies who would come with those drugs because they wanted
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.440]   to develop them. But the big pharma company said that they
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.160]   weren't in that area anymore. And we built a pipeline of such
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   drugs. The whole plan was some of them would work, some of
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.120]   them wouldn't, the successes would make up for the failures.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.920]   And it's now a $10 billion public company. And it returned,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.400]   unlike many private companies, you know, return a billion
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.680]   dollars plus to shareholders before going public. And it is
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.640]   doing continues to do well to this day. I led the company as
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.080]   CEO for seven years, five of the drugs I worked on are FDA
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.720]   approved today. The one I'm probably most proud of is is a
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.000]   drug that sexually biologic that is life saving therapy and kids.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.440]   Another one's an approved drug for prostate cancer. But that
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.120]   was my world is the point very different world, maybe more
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.080]   similar to your guys's world now than the world I'm in now.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.120]   Something funny happened in 2020, which was that, in my own
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.680]   company, there were demands that I make a statement on behalf of
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.200]   Black Lives Matter after the George Floyd, it was tragic
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.200]   death in May of 2020. By June, there were demands that I start
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   making statements on behalf of BLM. And it was a funny time
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.120]   because only starting that February, I had ventured into
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.080]   actually exercising my voice as a citizen, while being a CEO at
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.960]   my own peril criticizing what was then the still new shiny
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.600]   object of stakeholder capitalism. So I published this
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.520]   piece in the Wall Street Journal and generated some waves that
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.360]   February, few months later in May, this George Floyd
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.920]   controversy comes up. And the long story short, I can go into
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.000]   it if you guys are interested, but over the next six months, a
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.640]   series of escalating events led me to face a choice the
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.080]   following January of, you know, there's three advisors to my
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.000]   company that stepped down after I wrote a rather, I didn't
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   intend it to be but a rather controversial piece in the Wall
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   Street Journal at the time. What was the
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.320]   premise of the piece?
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.760]   21? Yeah, the premise of the piece was that it actually was
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.160]   controversial on numerous counts. But the basic premise
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.600]   was, it was the first legal argument anybody had made, that
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.960]   if the government is pressuring a private actor to do something
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.160]   that the government couldn't do directly, that that was still
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.600]   state action. Now, the subtext is this was in the wake of
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.240]   January 6, when there was widespread systematic
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.720]   censorship of, you know, political speech in this
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.600]   country, at least I believe there was. And so at the time I
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   made that argument, it was dismissed as a conspiracy theory
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.040]   on the facts. No, that's not happening. It was also dismissed
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   as a legal theory. You know, this Rube who happened to go to
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.600]   law school for God his first year where the First Amendment
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.920]   only applies to state actors. You know, now, fast forward,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.680]   three years, two and a half years, we now know those facts
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.480]   were far worse than even I envisioned at the time. And
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.200]   actually, the legal argument that I made is now popularized
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.600]   by Clarence Thomas and others that are finding its way into
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.960]   our jurisprudence. But anyway, three advisors to the company
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.680]   found it so offensive, that I would make this argument in
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.800]   public, that within 48 hours of that piece, they resigned,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.520]   that that was definitely a post Jan six mood and reaction, that
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.080]   I had to then make a choice, right? Because now this is
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.440]   having potentially an adverse impact on the company. I could
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.880]   either, all right, call it a year where I experimented with
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.920]   expressing myself and, you know, wearing my legal academic
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.960]   hat and call that a day and continue with biotech. Or
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.120]   legitimately, if I didn't want to have an adverse impact on my
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.720]   company, I could step down and really speak freely. I chose to
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.600]   I chose to step down, not in small part, because the company
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.160]   was doing great. You know, I had a successor lined up. So
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.800]   there was a fortunate set of circumstances that happened to
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.640]   be the right time. I just had my first son, my son, Karthik
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.200]   was born in February of 2020. He was about to turn a year old,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.480]   we were in a transitional phase of our life COVID, you know, we
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.720]   were we had a year away from the office, my wife was filling
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.120]   her fellowship, there was just a lot going on in her life that
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.520]   felt like this was a moment for a life transition to focus on
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.360]   a lot of people, talented people developing medicines, maybe
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.000]   some of them more talented than me, you know, rove into
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.120]   successful company.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.120]   Did you feel like you were being bullied into making a
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.080]   statement about Black Lives Matter by your own employees?
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.760]   And what's your thought? Generally speaking on companies
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.480]   being politically active and companies having a political
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.280]   voice because it has come up in our industry over and over
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.680]   again, you might know Brian Armstrong from Coinbase said,
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.200]   Hey, we're here to do crypto, nothing else. Please don't talk
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   about anything political. So what are your thoughts generally
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.840]   on that?
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.360]   You wrote a whole book on this, right? I mean, I read your book,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.520]   and it's a lot about the distinction between what the
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.840]   intention is in optimizing for shareholders versus the personal
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.720]   interests of the executives and those in charge, expressing
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.160]   their personal points of view through the corporation. And I
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.880]   think you had some points of view on where that should all go.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.480]   But was that in part motivating for you to run for public
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.120]   office? And why president instead of running for a senate
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.520]   seat or congressional seat or something else?
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.400]   Yeah, so it turns out I've written, I wrote three books in
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.680]   the last two years, and two of them are about this topic. The
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   first one is Woke Inc, which was for a general audience. And
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.720]   then there was a second one called capitalist punishment,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.160]   which was specifically about the ESG strand of this and
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.600]   capital markets. And just so people are aware, my general
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.320]   view is that companies should focus on making products and
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.360]   services for people who need them without apologizing for
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.480]   it. And yes, that's how you maximize profit for shareholders
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.680]   by having a worthy mission and sticking to it without taking
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.800]   on social missions that are best carried out by institutions
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.480]   outside of corporate America. I so much believe this that even
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.720]   before I ran for president, this actually does answer your
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.600]   question, Dave is, I actually thought the way I was going to
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.400]   have impact based on this. I enjoy being an author, but I'm
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.800]   not by nature, just an academic, I like to do things. I started
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.560]   a company called strive. It's an asset management firm that
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.760]   directly competes against the likes of BlackRock and State
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.960]   Street and Vanguard. That's what I thought my next leap was
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:28.040]   going to be. Strives first fund launched last August, and less
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.200]   than a year in it's close to a billion dollars in assets
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.520]   under management. I think it took JP Morgan two years to get
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.480]   to a billion when they got into the ETF business. That was what
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.360]   my journey was going to be is within corporate America,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.760]   restore the unapologetic pursuit of excellence over
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.640]   distracting and dilutive political, environmental and
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   social agendas. The thing that struck me, I think late last
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.280]   year, and last December, last year, we had our second son, got
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.600]   a new company off the ground. You all know what that entails.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.000]   It was very much an all in experience doing that. December,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.680]   we had some time to take a step back. My wife and I, we
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.600]   kind of take a moment to ask yourself, why are you doing what
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.880]   you're doing? It's not a conversation you often have or
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.720]   take time to do. The question of the why. It reminded me back
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.640]   of that experience I had at Royman. You asked me, did I feel
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   bullied? I didn't actually feel bullied. I could imagine
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.440]   someone in my shoes feeling that way, but I didn't feel like it
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   was somebody cornering me to do something I didn't want to do.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.200]   Others have had that experience. That wasn't quite how it felt
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.120]   for me. I felt like there's a group of people who followed me
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.720]   on this mission who look up to me, who were disappointed in me,
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.000]   actually. I think that was much harder than feeling like I was
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.560]   being bullied was to have a group of people who followed me
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.120]   on this worthy mission of developing medicines that pharma
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:51.080]   companies weren't, that felt proud of that mission, that now
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.240]   felt disappointed in me. That was much harder to deal with than
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.960]   the bullying, but that also opened my eyes to the fact that
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   I'm here stridently fighting against BlackRock and the ESG
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   industrial complex, which is a little bit of a deflection from
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.720]   the essence of what I actually think is going on at the real
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.440]   root cause, especially amongst young people in the country.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:10.940]   What is that?
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.480]   This is what I saw in my employees and the experience I
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.040]   went through. That was formative for me. These are good people.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.400]   These are earnest people, many of whom came. In many ways, it's
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.120]   my fault because the pitch that we made in recruiting, we
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.920]   recruited from Harvard and MIT and everywhere else. Big pharma
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.240]   companies didn't recruit out of undergrad. We did. Part of my
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   pitch was, "Hey, you want to go to a quant hedge fund and turn
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   that pile of cash into a bigger pile of cash, or do you want to
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.360]   actually make medicines that impact people's lives and do
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.000]   well that way?" That was part of even my pitch going in.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.240]   We select for a certain kind of person and then they come back
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.960]   and say they're disappointed in me for not adopting unrelated
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   social agendas. What dawned on me is that young people in this
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.640]   country – I'm a millennial. You guys are young. We're hungry
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.880]   for a cause. We're so hungry for purpose and meaning.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.360]   We're hungry for purpose and meaning and identity. Yet, we're
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.720]   starving for that at a time in our history when the things that
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.920]   used to fill that void – there's a lot of things that
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.080]   could fill that blank. I talked about it today at this
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.600]   Constitution camp here in New Hampshire. Faith, patriotism,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.200]   hard work, family. I think there's some truth to what
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.000]   Brian Armstrong told his employees. A corporation with a
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.240]   worthy mission can help fill that void too. I think that's
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.040]   one of the roles that CEOs who feel like they're being bullied
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.600]   might miss is you don't have people who are bullying you. You
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.880]   have people who are lost, who are looking to you for direction
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.440]   and purpose.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.640]   You're saying it quickly, but I think that family and religion
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.440]   are very, very big drivers of that.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.600]   Oh, huge. I'm just saying it quickly because I talk about
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.800]   that all the time. I think the family and faith – these are
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.240]   foundational building blocks.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.800]   They're foundational. I think that when you look statistically
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.560]   at the decay in the number of young people who are religious
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.000]   or the decay in the number of young people who actually have
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   two-parent families, all of this speaks to the fact that the
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.560]   social norms that gave people purpose have actually gone, but
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.880]   they haven't been replaced with anything else. I think that's
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.320]   the vacuum that you're seeing that many of these young people
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.760]   fall into. They're looking for something, to your point.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:24.200]   The problem with that is not the causes themselves, but the
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.400]   fact that they're short-lived. Then what's left over is
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.840]   the need for more and more and more. That escalation, I think,
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.200]   is very dangerous if you think about where society goes to
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.680]   from here.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.800]   Yeah, I agree with you on that. That's why I have been
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.360]   characterized – and Jason introduced me that way too – as
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:47.960]   anti-woke. I don't like that label because it's not inaccurate.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.240]   I don't like it because it's false. I think it misses the
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.880]   point where I think the way we actually combat – fill in your
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.520]   favorite blank – wokeism, climatism, COVID-ism, fentanyl
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.040]   usage, anxiety, depression, loss of self-confidence – these
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.880]   things are symptoms of a deeper void of purpose and meaning.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.560]   I don't think you help the matter much by – and I've done
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.600]   some of this, I will admit this, right? I'm not blaming other
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.200]   people. Have you read the book, Jason, or not?
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.400]   I haven't yet, but I will.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.240]   Okay. The book is titled and written before the word "woke"
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.040]   took on its current political valence. I will say that,
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.680]   actually. Many people didn't know what the word "woke" was
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.400]   at the time I titled the book.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.760]   It was fairly revelatory when you came out and used that word
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.720]   in your title. It was like, "Let me reveal to you a little bit
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.160]   about what this thing that I'm calling 'woke' is turning into,"
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.920]   which is a more broader kind of social, psychological issue
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.280]   that we're all grappling with. How it's now leeched its way
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.840]   into politics. It's leeched its way into non-profits. It's
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.200]   leeched its way into corporate America, into for-profits,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.080]   into the military, into government, etc. Obviously,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.640]   since that was published, it has now become this hot term
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.640]   that has different meaning for different people, and it can
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.600]   be pretty inciting in terms of how people react to it.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   I appreciate you saying that, Dave. I appreciate you saying
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.480]   that, Dave, because my net prescription is actually, we
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.280]   dilute not just wokeism. I mean, that's just part of the
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.360]   story. We dilute secular religions, the rise of secular
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.800]   religions. I don't call them even religions because religion
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.760]   has withstood the test of time. A cult has not. But the rise of
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.240]   modern secular cults, we dilute them to irrelevance by filling
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:38.360]   that void with an alternative vision. If one political camp
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.840]   might offer race and gender and sexuality and climate as a
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.760]   prescription for the void, I think where conservatives fall
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:52.200]   badly short is by simply being anti those things without
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.240]   actually offering an alternative vision of our own.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.360]   I am aiming certainly to do that in this campaign.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.280]   If you were going to replace race and gender and these kind
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.320]   of things, what would be your qualities or things to focus on?
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.040]   So let's do a little face-off. We're talking about race,
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.080]   gender, sexuality, climate. I pair them up against individual
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.720]   family, nation, God. I think that there's a substantive
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   vision here. I think America happened to have been founded
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.040]   on the latter vision, not the former. So if I'm running for
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.840]   US president, I think that that already tilts the scales in
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.240]   favor of this vision because it so happens as a historical
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.600]   matter. America was grounded on, some people will contest
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.040]   this, but I think on that vision rather than the genetic and
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.760]   climate-based one. But I think that that's something where the
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   Republican Party and conservatives have fallen short.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.400]   That's part of what, to your question, Jason, pulled me into
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.840]   this, is I saw the emergence of what was likely to be a
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.440]   biographical brawl between two guys who were the frontrunners
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.040]   or whatever. That's not productive. But I think more
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.440]   importantly than a biographical brawl, even the question about
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.640]   who we are, I think the Republican Party and the
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.280]   conservative movement was in many ways defining itself in
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.560]   opposition to that alternative vision of identity where what I
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   want to do, what I'm striving to do, and I hope we're doing,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.720]   is actually offering an affirmative vision of our own
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.200]   that go to the heart of what it means to be an American.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.440]   I don't think that national identity alone is going to fill
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.360]   that vacuum fully, but I think it makes a pretty good darn
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.400]   stride forward. I think there's roles for pastors and others.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.320]   That's beyond my pay grade. I'm not purporting to do that in
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.800]   this campaign. I speak to it, but that's going to be the role
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.880]   of people in a higher calling than being US president. But I
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.920]   think the next US president can play a meaningful role in
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.880]   filling that vacuum, at least when it comes to national
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.280]   identity. That's really what this campaign is about. It's not
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.920]   anti-woke. It is unapologetically nationalist in a
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.720]   certain sense of that word. Nationalist in the sense of
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.280]   embracing those ideals that set this nation into motion that
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.120]   still unite us across those genetically inherited attributes
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.760]   that we've otherwise celebrated over the last 10 years in this
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.000]   country.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.160]   It's safe to say you believe in American exceptionalism, and
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.680]   that's your platform for running for-
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.160]   That is my platform. That is absolutely my platform. The
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.200]   exceptionalism of the ideals that set this country into
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.320]   motion. Absolutely.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.000]   Absolutely. So, Vivek, let me ask a question around where we
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   are in the cycle of the American experiment, where we have
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.880]   obviously allowed the throttle to be full forward, and as a
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.920]   result, we've seen extraordinary progress emerge from the
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.400]   entrepreneurial talents and the drive of the people of this
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.320]   country for the past 250 years. And it's really extraordinary
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.440]   and it transformed human civilization. We now find
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.640]   ourselves, particularly over the past 50 years as this
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.800]   problem has gotten worse, with increasing disparity between
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.320]   the haves and the have-nots, or those who believe they have
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.520]   not, which is nearly everyone. Everyone now has some point of
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.240]   view that they have not got something, and they see other
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.600]   people that do have something that they do not. And this
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.480]   inequality and this perception of inequality, both with respect
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.400]   to absolute amounts of capital, income, earnings, and these
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.040]   perception issues, have now driven a populist movement in
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.960]   this country that we have seen historically, many times in the
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.640]   past, different countries that ultimately turn into either
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:25.720]   socialist nations or fascist nations. In all cases, some
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.320]   sort of autocratic regime seems to have emerged because of this
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.280]   populist movement that we're now seeing not just in the US, but
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.760]   across the West. Do you feel like we're at that moment in the
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.640]   US? And one of the manifestations of that, I'll say,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.680]   is government spending. Because everyone demands more from their
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.600]   government, and the government steps up, and the elected
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.720]   officials that they elect step up and spend more, and it layers
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.240]   and it layers and layers. And we now have a $33 trillion debt
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.760]   load, and we have a $1.5 trillion annual deficit, and by
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.560]   many projections, Social Security will be bankrupt in
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.880]   anywhere from 10 to 15 years, 10 to 20 years, whatever numbers
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.120]   you want to use. The CBO assumes we're going to have
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.400]   unsustainable, spiraling debt. What is your point of view on
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.000]   where we are in the cycle, how it's manifesting today, and how
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.320]   we're going to deal with the fiscal issues that arise from
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:13.960]   these movements?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:19.320]   Yeah, so I think where we are in that in the cycle, I don't
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.880]   take that as a passive law of physics. I think that who runs
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.600]   this country and leads this country can make an actual
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.520]   difference in the actual underlying course of that so
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.160]   called cycle, which is part of what pulls me into this. So I'm
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.120]   a little bit unconventional on my views on the debt load and
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.920]   the entitlement spending in this country and our first step in
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.440]   our way out of it. I don't think we're at a place of having
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   remotely enough consensus or trust, and I think trust is
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.480]   probably the more important word than consensus, to begin just
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.360]   snip snip, make cuts to what people feel like they were
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.240]   entitled to and promised, especially in a moment where
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.040]   we're beginning with deep distrust, that will take what
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.520]   you call those populist flames and throw kerosene on it.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.520]   I do, I'm more optimistic about this. And I think this is quite
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.720]   realistic, actually, is that the next leap forward is we can
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.200]   grow our way out of, I'm not going to say all but most of our
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.440]   actual fiscal calamity, pending fiscal calamity. This year, I
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.840]   mean, I think like right now, last six months, we're talking
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.920]   less than 1.5% annualized GDP growth, what we're averaging
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.000]   right now, for most of our national history, we actually
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.120]   grown at over four plus percent GDP growth. Certainly, if you go
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.320]   back to the pre gold standard period, and even after going off
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.360]   the gold standard, we had a relatively stable US dollar and
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.560]   I am one of these weird guys who believes that the Fed should
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.240]   have a single mandate of dollar stability without playing the
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.000]   Phillips curve game. But anyway, put that sidetrack to
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   one side, we've grown at three, 4% GDP growth for most of our
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   national history, even relatively recent national
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.240]   history. And I don't think it's a complicated path to get back
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.400]   there. I think things we need to do unlock American energy.
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.560]   There's, you know, we talked about secular religions, I view
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.200]   the climate cult as one of those secular religions, what's your
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.920]   energy pack? What was your specific energy plan be
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.760]   completely, completely unlock the permitting process that
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.080]   they've used as a backdoor mechanism to shut down American
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.680]   energy production, drilling, fracking, burning coal, coal
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.160]   should not be a four letter word embracing nuclear energy.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.120]   Later tonight, like after we're having this conversation this
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.400]   evening, I'm going to be at St. Anselm College, laying out my
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.520]   detail, it's gonna be like a giant poster, laying out the
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.080]   anatomy of how I will shut down the Nuclear Regulatory
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.920]   Commission, which has been a fundamentally hostile
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.680]   administrative agency to the existence of nuclear power in
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.560]   this country, actually, even to the detriment of actually
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.040]   making sure that we are getting our nuclear energy from Gen
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.240]   two, rather than Gen three or Gen four reactors. But that'll
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.120]   be for tonight. It's an all of the above approach of
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.640]   unshackling ourselves to produce energy here in the
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.160]   United States. To your point about, you know, David made a
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.560]   good point earlier about the addiction of paying people more
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.480]   from the federal government that becomes the status quo, if
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.280]   that's your voter base. That's not even good in many cases for
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.920]   the people who are giving that money to, I think we should
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.840]   stop paying people to stay at home. When actually the top
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.320]   obstacle for many businesses to grow, you guys will know this
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.120]   well, is filling vacant job openings. And so that is an
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.880]   obstacle to GDP growth is paying people more to stay at
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.920]   home than many of them earn to go back to work. Do you think
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.680]   that the IRA was good legislation? I don't have. It's
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.960]   not like it's not like my the horse that I'm gonna, you know,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.640]   ride right in terms of like the main I'm gonna pin everything
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.680]   on it. But But I mostly don't think it was it was great
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.040]   legislation. But like, where are you coming from on that?
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.480]   Because we might have different reasons.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.080]   If you think about what the IRA does for energy, and frankly, if
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.560]   you just roll up the bi ellipsis chips in IRA, I'm just curious
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.240]   your thoughts on whether government incentives are moving
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.600]   in that direction that you actually support, or you still
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.120]   think it's, it's missing something?
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.520]   Well, so one of the things that I actually focus on, and I
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.240]   think is really important is, what can the US President
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.680]   actually do? I mean, President Trump's I don't know, people
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.800]   remember this, his main promise, policy promise was actually
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.280]   repeal and replace Obamacare, which never happened, because
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.320]   it required going through Congress. So I'm actually
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.520]   focused on elements that I can deliver on, without asking
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.640]   Congress either for permission or forgiveness. And so that's
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.800]   all my answer to Jason was, I go straight to at least let's
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.760]   focus on actually, the administrative state, which on my
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.720]   reading of the Constitution reports in to the single duly
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.800]   elected president. So when I talk about the permitting
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.360]   process at the Department of Interior, or shutting down the
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.960]   Nuclear Regulatory Commission, I believe in, you know, we could
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.520]   go I'm going into details on it tonight, I have the legal
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.240]   authority to do that as the US President, I think the
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.480]   legislation is gonna be much more complicated. And I don't
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.320]   believe that I can be in a position to promise what we
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.160]   would do legislatively to any of that.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.040]   You mentioned getting people to take all these jobs that are
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.320]   available. Do you want to talk about immigration for a second?
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.200]   And what you think about that?
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.600]   Yeah, merit based immigration, immigration, would, would you
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.000]   are you saying you would cut entitlements like unemployment
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.560]   or shorten the unemployment period to force people to go
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.160]   back to work? Is that what I'm reading?
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.440]   And tie them to work requirements? Absolutely. Yeah.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.920]   Would you have a specific for that, like a certain number of
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.680]   months or, you know, a pretty good, a pretty good, I mean, I
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.880]   do. But I think that's, again, I'm very clear about what I will
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.680]   do through executive authority, what needs to go through
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   legislation. I mean, that's all a negotiation. But I think a
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:46.440]   good principle is 1996 or in the 1990s, workfare under Clinton
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.280]   was actually far more aggressive than the work environment work
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.520]   requirements that were put into this supposed Republican led
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   debt deal where, like, what did they say? It was if you're age
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:04.200]   18 to 55, and you are able bodied and childless, then you
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.840]   have to work at least 20 hours a week in order to receive more
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:12.760]   than three months out of three years worth of welfare, right?
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.840]   You know, Joe Biden as a US senator voted for actually much
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.120]   more stringent workfare requirements in the 90s. So,
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.680]   you know, yes, I have ideas on specifics, but I'm not going to
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   make a promise on exactly what that specific will look like.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.640]   But a guiding principle is, it has to be at least as aggressive
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.520]   as what we adopted.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.120]   I mean, to your point during Clinton, we had 69, almost 70%
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.720]   participation, and we're at 60. And now I think so. It's
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.760]   obvious that we have to trim that. But to Tomas, next point,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.560]   you know, we have 10 million job openings. We're not letting
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.440]   anybody in. How would you look at immigration? Obviously, we
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.320]   have people coming in the southern border illegally. And
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.760]   then we have h1 b visas. And now Canada is saying, hey, we'll
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.480]   steal all those h1 bs. We'll take them. So how do you look at
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.000]   immigration to Tomas question?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.200]   Merit based immigration? I mean, one of the things that Canada
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.000]   does have, and I'm not a fan of America imitating Canada or
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.040]   anything like this in most respects, but they do have a
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.760]   point based system, right? They have a point based system. And
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.120]   so I think the point based system should work differently
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.840]   in the US. But I do favor merit based immigration. I'm a little
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.320]   bit of a departure from what I think is the Republican
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.440]   consensus here. You know, people I respect Tom Cotton and others
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.640]   have proposed bills with a hard cap on the number of immigrants.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.400]   I it's a mistake. I think that the cap should declare itself
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.440]   based on how many people meet the meritocratic criteria.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.560]   We're not a little different qualities, then for what would
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.280]   be your top criteria in this point based system to criteria
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.480]   skills that match up to job openings in the United States.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.120]   But secondarily, and this one's important to me, I would move
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.000]   the civics portion of becoming a citizen to the front end of
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.120]   even being granted a visa to enter this country. And I think
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.360]   that addresses and accommodates an important part of the concern
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.040]   that many people who are pro immigration cap actually favor
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.280]   is I think there are legitimate concerns about the dilution,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.120]   the loss of a national identity. But a lot of that is conflated
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.000]   with first the cycle of illegal immigration. I'm a hard liner on
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.840]   this. I favor putting the US military on the southern border.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.800]   I've said I would use it on the northern border. I believe that
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.640]   we are on strong constitutional and legal authority to do it. I
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.200]   do not think building the wall was enough. There are cartel
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.000]   finance tunnels underneath that wall that vehicles literally
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.480]   run through today. So in some ways, I'm going further than
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.600]   Trump in this direction. But simultaneously, debureaucratize
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.360]   speed up the process for merit based immigration. But part of
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:42.760]   merit includes not just skills, but also civic commitments to
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.800]   the country. And I'm, you know, I use the word nationalist
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.200]   before I know that scares some people. I mean it in a positive
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.160]   way. I think every high school student in this country should
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.360]   have to pass the same civics test that an immigrant has to
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.880]   pass in order to become a citizen of this country. I also
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.440]   would favor bringing that on the front end and it selects for the
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   kind of people who know something about the country when
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.280]   they enter, which I think is a good thing. It's
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.920]   people should assimilate. And they should love this country in
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.280]   order to come into the country. Yes, I do. I think I think you
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.160]   should want to come here to be an American. Yeah. I think I
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.600]   think I think you get agreement around the horn here. sacks,
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.360]   you've heard the vex position so far, you obviously are
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.640]   passionate about the GOP. What do you agree with? And what
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   don't you agree with so far? Well, there's a lot of stuff to
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.280]   agree with. There we're talking about American exceptionalism.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.880]   One thing I want to talk about there is that I agree that
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.840]   America is exceptional. And we're most exceptional when
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.640]   we're trying to set an example for other nations. We're trying
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.960]   to be the shining city on a hill, as Reagan put it. But
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.080]   lately, and really, I mean, over the last couple of decades,
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.000]   what you've seen is that what American exceptionalism means to
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.120]   a lot of people in Washington, is that we run all over the
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.280]   world and impose our ideology and our values on all these
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.880]   different countries. We began this great crusade to try and
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.040]   spread democracy in the Middle East, we tried to turn
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.400]   countries like Afghanistan and Iraq, into Madisonian
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.360]   democracies, where you now are very, very involved in Ukraine,
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.520]   basically trying to detach that country from the Russian sphere
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.960]   of influence and turning it into a member of our military
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.200]   and economic alliance. So it does seem like American
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.000]   exceptionalism has taken on this sort of harder, more
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.800]   militarized edge, where would you draw the line? I mean, like
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.960]   what makes sense to you? I think I basically agree with
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.880]   everything you just said. I think as a side note on the
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.000]   geopolitics of it, I do think Ukraine is on track to become
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.720]   potentially the next Vietnam or the next Iraq. I think you have
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:51.400]   said similar things. I also think there's something else
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.360]   going on with Ukraine that's fueling this, which relates to
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.040]   the deeper identity crisis in our country that I described
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:01.320]   earlier. I think Ukraine has become a new religion, right, in
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.120]   the country. And it's a substitute for purpose and
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.400]   meaning, just like climate ideology or woke-ism is. And,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.440]   you know, there's the flag.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.080]   It's like a crusade. I mean, you have people like waving
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:11.560]   these.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.200]   Absolutely. You go to Washington, DC, at least I did
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.000]   in June, I was there for one of the Sunday shows where my wife
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.440]   and I are going for a walk. We saw more trans flags and
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.320]   Ukraine flags than we did American flags on a short walk
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.880]   that we took through Washington, DC, our nation's
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.440]   capital. So I'm not whining about this or being histrionic
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   about it. I just think getting to the essence of what's going
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.400]   on, I think that's a different element of Ukraine that's
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.200]   different from even what we saw with Vietnam or Iraq. I don't
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.480]   think American exceptionalism is foisting our values on anyone.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.760]   I think American exceptionalism is about demonstrating
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.520]   through our example, how America flourishes and is strong
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.280]   when we live by our own ideals. And I think the best way we
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.120]   give hope to the free world is by being that shining city on a
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.880]   hill, not going somewhere else and talking about it with tanks
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.560]   behind us, while actually suffering here at home. If you
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.760]   roam the streets of Kensington, as I did a few weeks ago, you
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.200]   know, you don't have to go to Baghdad to see the third world.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:16.040]   And so that I think is, I think, a big loss of where we are
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.880]   today in the country. When your president Putin invades Ukraine,
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.520]   you would sit back, not give any armaments and let him roll in.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.360]   Here's what I would do. I would actually be proactive in doing
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.240]   a deal. And I've been very clear about the deal I would do.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.120]   Trump has said he would do a deal in 24 hours. He hasn't
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.000]   said what it was. I believe there's a deal to be done. But
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.640]   I also believe it's important to be clear about what the
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.120]   contours of that deal would be. I would freeze the current line.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.160]   Let's take the status quo right now. So I can answer your
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.880]   question. Or I could answer starting from the present. If
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.680]   you don't, we could do both. I mean, the obvious Yeah, the
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.880]   obvious is maybe put NATO take NATO off the table and avoid the
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.840]   whole thing. But now we're playing. Yeah, we're playing
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.080]   I would say history. So maybe it's better. Yeah. What's
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.920]   happening now? Present, right? Because I don't think that we
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.840]   would have if I was president, I don't think we would have
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.080]   gotten to the point of those things rolling in Angela
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.720]   Merkel made some disastrous comments. Putin made a hard
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.000]   demand. We would have said hard no to Ukraine joining NATO. And
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.600]   that would have been that there would have been no tanks rolling
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.240]   in Putin may have taken NATO off the table, Putin may have
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.880]   still invaded. We don't know. I don't I don't think so. But we
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.040]   can't, you know, those are counterfactuals that we can
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.680]   actually, you know, we're not gonna have one side or the other
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:27.080]   being able to prove that right. So let's talk about the present.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.720]   Right now. Let's say I'm US President, I would freeze the
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.520]   current lines of control. We have a precedent for doing this
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.760]   to Korean War, Korean War style armistice. That does give Putin
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.640]   most of the Donbass region. That's beyond the pale of what
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:45.960]   many are willing to accept in either party. But I think any
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.680]   deal, someone has to win, everyone has to win something
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.400]   out of the deal, I would further then give that assurance that
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:56.440]   NATO will not admit Ukraine to NATO. But there's a requirement
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.480]   in return, the biggest requirement is that Russia has
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:04.600]   to exit its military partnership with China. There's a 2001
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   treaty, it's called the Treaty of good neighborliness and
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.160]   cooperation, military cooperation between the two
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.640]   countries, that Xi Jinping and Putin ratcheted up to the so
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.880]   called strategic no limits partnership in 2022. That is why
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.800]   China is now coming by the way, to Russia's aid. I personally
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.560]   believe we are absolutely sending Putin into Xi Jinping's
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.720]   arms in a way that's a mistake. I would also require that Putin
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.400]   remove his nuclear weapons from Kaliningrad that we take any
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.880]   Russian military presence in the US in the Western Hemisphere
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:40.520]   off the table, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua. I think this is a
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.000]   deal that Putin would do if we paired it with reopening
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.040]   economic relations with Russia, which I would do. Because I
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.360]   think Putin does not and I can give you some evidence for this.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.080]   But I think Putin does not enjoy being Xi Jinping's little
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.040]   brother. And so I think that this is actually an opportunity
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.640]   and I have to confess, I am a guy who sees our foreign policy
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:01.000]   prism through the prism of believing that China is the top
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.840]   long run threat that we face. And so most of my foreign policy
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   views and national security views, even on topics that are
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.760]   apparently unrelated to China, I still see it through that
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.400]   prism. But this one isn't a far leap because China's literally
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.680]   in a military treaty with Russia and coming to their aid. I would
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.000]   use the Ukraine war and an end to the Ukraine war as a way to
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.320]   bifurcate the Russia China relationship and divide,
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.400]   basically dissolve that relationship. And then actually
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.080]   that's our best way and most effective step towards deterring
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.400]   Xi Jinping from going after Taiwan. Because right now Xi
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.760]   Jinping, I think that there's a mistaken consensus view that the
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.600]   way he thinks about it is, oh, reason by analogy rather than by
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.640]   actual analyzing of a situation say, oh, well, he got that piece
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.040]   of land, maybe I can go get this island. I don't think he
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.360]   reasons by analogy. I think he reasons by the cards he has in
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.000]   terms of hard power. So his bet is that the US won't want to go
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.440]   to war with two different allied nuclear superpowers at the same
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.920]   time. But if Russia is no longer in his camp, then Xi Jinping is
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.480]   going to have to think twice about going after Taiwan. So
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.920]   then I guess my broader Taiwan,
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.360]   the obvious question there is, you wouldn't defend Ukraine,
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.720]   would you have America and the allies defend Taiwan if it was
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.000]   invaded? I would at least until the US has achieved
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.840]   semiconductor independence. So you would defend the thing.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.320]   Yeah, because we depend on them for our modern way of life in a
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.680]   way that we don't on Ukraine. And then the latter part of this
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.160]   is sounds a little crass to some people, but I believe in
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.800]   being honest, I actually think that I'll get to the get to this
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.120]   point in a second. But to answer your question, yes, until we've
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.600]   achieved semiconductor independence, I believe we can
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.960]   achieve semiconductor independence.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.480]   Yeah. So it's not your belief is not, hey, these are two
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.760]   democracies, they both deserve equal defense from the United
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.560]   States, Ukraine and Taiwan. It's Ukraine doesn't have
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.360]   semiconductors, we don't have a strategic need to defend them
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.480]   yet in Taiwan. So it's a lot more of a pragmatic cutthroat
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.680]   approach to foreign policy.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.040]   It is I, of course, you know, resist the characterization of
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.160]   cutthroat a little bit. I go back to the principle that David
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.840]   mentioned of what American exceptionalism is, to me is that
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:19.080]   when America is strong, and is flourishing, and Americans are
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.840]   flourishing within America, we set the example for the free
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.000]   world of what is possible. And so my view is that yes, at least
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.640]   until time until we're semiconductor self sufficient,
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.080]   and I think things work out here where I think we can get there.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.680]   So in five years, we're, we've got our semiconductors up and
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.640]   running. You'll let China roll into Taiwan, no big deal for you.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:45.960]   I will say that I definitely evaluate that very differently
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.440]   than I do.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.000]   Sacha, but I but I your thoughts on that is important.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.960]   Freebird.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.560]   Yeah, let me just ask. So Vivek, I mean,
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:00.360]   I think that your point is a really important one, which is
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.120]   that when we're happy at home, we tend not to look for conflict
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:09.480]   abroad. That's almost a universal truth that's emerged
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:15.480]   from history, human civilization has shown that, you know, when
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.600]   the people in a democracy in particular are happy at home,
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.440]   and certainly autocracies are quite different.
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.080]   Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, you go
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.800]   through history, but like when you have a true democracy, you
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.480]   don't vote to go and you don't support the idea of conflict
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.520]   abroad if you're happy at home. But the counter is true, which
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.680]   is when you're unhappy at home, you tend to look for conflict
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.760]   abroad. And by some assessments, Ray Dalio had this great book
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.440]   about this. The changing world order, I don't know if you if
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.800]   you read it. But you know, he makes this point about the
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.000]   internal strife leads to external conflict, which is why
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.520]   it felt like we were going to go that way with Ukraine, Russia,
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.440]   coming out of 21. So I wonder, are we happy at home?
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.360]   We're not.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.920]   And I want to ask it. I want to ask another question tied to
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.760]   this. Why is Donald Trump leading in the polls? Because I
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.880]   think that the two go hand in hand, there is something that he
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.320]   represents. And there's something about his voice, that I
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.480]   think echoes the sentiment of this populist unhappiness
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.680]   inside of this country today, that manifests in a bunch of
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:23.800]   ways, one of which is the interest in and support for
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.680]   external conflict. But I don't know if you're up for kind of
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.920]   thinking about tackling the two questions together. But I love
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.400]   your your take on that. Great question.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.480]   I think you're absolutely right. I mean, you're extending a theme
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.960]   of where I talk about sort of domestic cultural annoyances, as
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.440]   a symptom of a deeper vacuum in our national soul. I think that
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.280]   actually our projection and focus abroad is a lot easier of
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.120]   a deflection away from the harder step of taking a long,
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.840]   hard look in the mirror and asking ourselves about the
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.280]   health of our own nation today. And so I think that's a deep
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.880]   question. I think we're not healthy as a nation today. I
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.840]   think we suffer from deep seated psychic insecurity,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.960]   psychological insecurities. I think the economic stagnation,
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.840]   the fact that real wage growth isn't up for the bottom 99% of
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.240]   the country. A lot of that I put at the feet of the Federal
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.120]   Reserve. There are a lot of other complex factors behind it.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.920]   But a lot of this feeds into what you call populism. I don't
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.680]   excuse me, I don't I don't like that word, by the way, just to
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.720]   be clear. I think that it's just imprecise. And I don't find it
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.960]   useful. That tries to catch too many things, and it doesn't
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.280]   catch any of them enough. So yeah, yeah, you think what
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:36.840]   you're calling populism is actually a failure of our elites.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.960]   Isn't that what's going on? We saw during COVID, that all the
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.480]   health authorities did a horrible job, the CDC, and the
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.600]   NIH, it turns out they were funding function research, which
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.720]   may have caused COVID. In the first place, they were doing
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.600]   experiments on bat viruses, almost certainly did cause Yeah,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.840]   exactly. So you know, we keep finding out that the elites are
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.440]   supposed to be running the country and running these
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.160]   institutions are doing absolutely horrible job. That's
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.360]   what the reaction is against. Then people come along and label
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.680]   a populism and say it's going to lead to fascism. It's like,
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:10.840]   come on, that is a way of protecting the people in power
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.800]   from accountability for the horrible job they're doing.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.440]   It's well said.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:19.240]   Absolutely. And the use of the word populism is almost
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.520]   stacking that debate in favor of saying that those grievances
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.480]   aren't legitimate. And so I think why is Donald Trump
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:29.880]   polling at number one in the polls, because people know the
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.040]   truth. I think those grievances are absolutely legitimate. Now,
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.200]   I think the mood of the country has changed a little bit,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.120]   including the mood of the hard conservative base has changed
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:44.360]   since 2015. I think there is now I think there is now a sense
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.000]   that what are we actually going to do about it? Are we are we
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.080]   going to go the direction of a national divorce? I mean,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.680]   divorce is one of these things that speaks itself into
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.120]   existence, maybe applies at the same level of a nation, right?
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.560]   That's on the table. It's in the it's in the ether. I don't
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   think most people, including in our hardcore America first base,
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.040]   I'm part of that base. I don't think want a national divorce.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.400]   And so I think that the moment now calls for this why I'm in
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.280]   this race. This is actually why at this point, I couldn't have
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   told you this in March, but at this point, I'm convinced we're
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:21.320]   actually gonna be successful in this. This is what the unique
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.960]   fusion we're going to require is not somebody showing up saying
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.800]   hope kumbaya, let's move forward, compromise, hold hands
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.840]   and declare its morning again in America. No, that ain't gonna
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.240]   work. But I think it requires recognizing the legitimacy of
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.760]   those grievances, not as lip service, I believe, for the same
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.200]   reason, sexist measure. Many of those grievances are legitimate,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   they're grounded in truth. But to say, as I often say to the
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.360]   left, hardship is not the same thing as victimhood. And we're
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.160]   not going to choose victimhood. We're going to choose
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.800]   recognition of truth as our best path to heal over whatever's
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.880]   happened and then to move forward. That's why I've come
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.440]   out and been very vocal about the fact that I would pardon
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.840]   Trump of each of the two indictments that have already
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.080]   been brought in. If the J six indictment is brought against
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.400]   him, I would do the same thing. I think that we have to be able
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.880]   to recognize the truth of our past grievances of our fellow
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:21.160]   Americans, and actually, not just pay lip service to it, but
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.360]   feel into it and acknowledge the reality of them. I think that's
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.440]   then the table stakes of Vince meeting a demand that many in
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.120]   our grassroots conservative base have, I'm one of them, a desire
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.600]   to also move forward as one nation. And I think both of
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.680]   those elements are going to be required. They don't go
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.840]   together. I think there are people in the Republican
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.920]   primary who offer each of those on their own. Yeah.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.600]   Whoever's successful gonna have to offer both this morning,
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.760]   there was a an opinion piece. I'm assuming you read it by
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.280]   Rich Lowry, chief of the National Review, published on
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:59.320]   Politico. Get ready for the Vivek Ramaswamy moment in which I
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.120]   would say he's fairly effusive about the campaign you're
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.760]   running, right? I mean, would you agree like if you said you
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.640]   said, yeah, there was a really, yeah, some really taken that
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.160]   one. Did you read the piece? I mean, I thought there was some
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.720]   really nice abusive. Oh, really? He loves you. Yeah. No, he
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.800]   said, he doesn't love me. Actually, he doesn't love you.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.040]   But he said, I think he said some complimentary things.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.760]   That's okay. About your campaign about your character,
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.000]   but said, there's no way you're going to win and win for
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.120]   president. Well, you went from under 1%. I think now the latest
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.920]   polls has you above 5%. And we're in the very early
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.640]   endings here, right? I think there's one that just came. I
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.400]   mean, yeah, there's some that have, you know, bounced a
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.000]   little higher than that. But yeah, you're a little higher
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.160]   before the first debate, the thing that we've done, let me
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.880]   just state this in observer, and then you can react to it is
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:45.320]   that you have kind of inserted yourself in the debate on every
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.680]   issue. You know, every day as it comes up, I mean, you're kind
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.040]   of living off the land as a candidate, not out there with
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.400]   just kind of a traditional stump speech, but you're finding
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.600]   a way to insert yourself into the debate every day on social
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.080]   media. I see it, right? I mean, you post a tweet that will hit
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.000]   the nerve of whatever the issue is going viral that day, which
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.720]   means that you'll go viral. And so for months, I've been seeing
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.960]   your tweets go super viral. And so it's not surprising to me
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.520]   that your candidacy starting to, you know, catch on in that way.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.960]   What's remarkable to me is that other candidates can't do it. I
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.640]   mean, when you first started doing it, I was kind of like,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.680]   okay, this is obvious and easy. Of course, this is what you
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.560]   would do. But other candidates have not really done that for
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.760]   whatever reason. So I mean, am I correct?
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.480]   You know, my perspective? Yeah, my perspective on that, because
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:38.600]   if we use it like it is when you accuse us of creating a
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.120]   banking crisis, but other than that,
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:44.440]   I do want to close the loop on that one. You can either do it
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:49.320]   on air or off. Let's go do it right now. Yeah. You know, so
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.360]   for the other candidates, I do it's anyway, that's less
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.720]   interesting. It's fine. Maybe they'll do it. I think it's not
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.160]   running it through a filter, right? Because because I think
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.560]   the traditional political thing is, and here's what's going to
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:02.040]   happen to me as a consequence, I'm going to eat the consequence
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.280]   of this, right? Everything comes at a cost. There's no free
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.480]   lunch. I'm going to say something in real time that
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.880]   reflects my honest instincts. That's my whole strategy, right?
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.720]   People can tell the difference. But then I'm going to change my
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.920]   mind on one out of 100 things. Okay? And that's just going to
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.320]   happen, right? And I just have to be open to that and eat my
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:22.600]   words. And, you know, I'm going to do it at some point. And
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.000]   that's the trade off we're making is that I'm not running
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.280]   it through the filters. I'm not making up what I believe I'm
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.520]   telling you actually, to the contrary, what I truly believe.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.520]   But if I'm doing it really that rapidly in response to what's
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.680]   happening, I think people appreciate that. But I'm going
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.320]   to eat my words at some point. That's okay. In response to new
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.680]   information, you might find new information, or sometimes even
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.160]   in response to reflection, right? So that's a gaffe,
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   basically, because it's less filtered, is what you're saying.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.480]   You might make a gap. Do you want to close the loop on this
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:52.360]   other thing? Yeah. Do you think you caused a banking crisis by
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.880]   using all caps locks when he tweeted? Yes or no? I did not.
[00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.520]   I can't tweet on a Saturday night called the back was a
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.520]   bank run. I did not say I did not. I never said that either.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.480]   But we did go at it pretty hard. I think actually, I think
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.360]   there's a chance we might still disagree, Dave. But I think that
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.560]   I'm talking to sacks here. But yeah. So, so I actually talked
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:21.080]   to a lot of friends who were in the position of running
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.520]   companies that had some amount of gap. And we talked through
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.840]   this, like the specifics of the situation, and then it dawned on
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.000]   me where it might, it's not, it's not necessarily we're going
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.120]   to agree at the end of this, but there's a chance that we might
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:40.040]   actually, which is this. So in the lead up to this before that
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.240]   Friday, I was already against any governmental intervention
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.960]   here, let this play out. Why? Because like, let's put aside
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.160]   all the histrionics do the math on it. And I'm remembered,
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.320]   there's a little hazy now, right? So on the facts, but I
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.800]   think it's approximately right. And you correct me if you have
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.200]   up to date facts on this, but I think it's approximately right.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.720]   If everybody had run and gotten their money out, I think it
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.040]   would have been like 94 cents on the dollar that everybody
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.560]   would have walked out with. Right. And so what happened on
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.440]   Friday is in this the part where I want to potentially build a
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.120]   bridge here. The part that what happened on Friday was that
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:22.840]   Friday was the government, FDIC or otherwise froze the ability
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.640]   to regulator Friday morning. Yeah, yeah, the Friday morning
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   you much closer to this, you know, in the details, but the
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.000]   California regulator froze the ability to take out deposits. So
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.320]   I am more sympathetic to the point that once the government's
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.360]   gotten involved, because that really is then like, you know,
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.960]   kind of like an oh crap moment where you're CEO of a company
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.680]   or CFO and you want to get your money and then you can't now
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.320]   it's panic, right? Right. And so I think that there's a version
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.400]   of the world where the version of the world I wanted, I was
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.720]   talking about this before you and I were talking directly to
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.480]   each other. I just think they should have stayed out of it.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.520]   94 cents on the dollar. Not bad, which is why the public
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.400]   didn't actually end up directly using taxpayer funds was because
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.880]   the bank was healthy in its own right. That's what that's the
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.920]   worst result of bank run would have produced there, which
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:08.280]   actually should have been heartening in terms of
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.400]   confidence. Let me give you an insight that maybe you weren't
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.240]   as close to as the rest of us were, which is on all the
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.800]   boards that all of us sit on. All of the boards were
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.600]   discussing independent of this show and the conversations in
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.880]   the media. We need to move all of our money out of all of the
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:27.000]   banks that aren't one of the top three and move all of our
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.240]   money into those top three. So the point is, which is the
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.960]   shape into the six, you know, to the top four subs. That's
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.240]   the point of view that we all saw was that there was a mad
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.400]   rush in corporate America in startup land, in small business
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.920]   land. This isn't even VC land. This is like everything from
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.360]   the nonprofits that we sit on the board of to the, you know,
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.080]   laundromat to the dry cleaner to every business I got you. I
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.720]   have some money in a small bank was saying I got to move my
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.600]   money into a big bank now. And that's where the whole banking
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.320]   system is put at risk. And that is why we all universally felt
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.280]   that it was important to highlight that the federal
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.640]   government needs to step in and reassure and rebuild confidence
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.160]   in the small banks in this country just deposits not only
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.800]   and that the only way to do that was to say your deposits are
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:15.320]   safe. And that was it. And that was the point because the panic
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.120]   that was going on in small business land in America, which
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.240]   as you know, employs half of the people in this country was at
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.880]   risk, and that those people, those small businesses were
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.360]   fearful, and they were looking to rush to the big banks, and
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.000]   that would have cratered the small banks around the country.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   So and I think it's a difference in vantage point,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.160]   right? You have discussion about populism and everything else.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:38.520]   I don't think Dave Sacks caused the bank run any more than I'm
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.280]   causing populist waves in this country. Again, it was with his
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.040]   caps lock. But yeah, but I think I think the reality is people
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.120]   literally have tweeted that I caused the bank runs insane.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.000]   But there's, there's a technical there's a technical
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.080]   point I'll make and then we'll get to the deeper point. The
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.840]   technical point to close loop is, I think, Dave, I find your
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:02.200]   position more reasonable, given that it's after Friday, when the
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.840]   California regulators came in and locked in. But in my version
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:08.200]   of the world, I would have just said, stay the heck out,
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.720]   government of any kind, 94 cents on the dollar, there's a 6%
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.400]   haircut. And we've discovered the market actually works. And we
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.680]   avoid playing favoritism in the first place. And I say this as
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.240]   somebody who and this is where you understand my vantage point
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:26.280]   have been a longtime opponent of the creation of the notion of
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.080]   sibs, systemically important banks in the first place, as an
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.800]   opponent to the bailouts of 2008, as somebody who's running
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.000]   for US President, not to lead incremental reforms, but a sort
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.880]   of revolution in the kind of restoration and the integrity of
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:40.440]   both capitalism and democracy that I think is actually the
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.720]   best antidote to would you try to construct the sibs?
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.480]   Well, I mean, given the status quo of where we are, I think
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.080]   that I would have to offer a credible enough basis to make
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.880]   sure that people know that if there's a systemic so called
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.880]   previously known as systemically important bank that
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.440]   fails, that the public still not going to be there for them.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.920]   But in a way that allows for enough of a enough of an
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.840]   unburdened banking sector that we have resilience in terms of
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.200]   exactly who can actually fill that void. And I think that
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.960]   there is a discursive impact on I don't think it has to be. And
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.720]   this is where maybe I disagree a little bit. And this is a
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.440]   small scale disagreement. I don't think it has to be a state
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.920]   of the world where we just assume consumers are dumb, and
[00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.400]   don't take this into account. Consumers are in part dumb,
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.520]   because we treat them as dumb, right? And so these, it's like a
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.200]   Heisenberg effect, right? You can't, you know, you assume
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.320]   you're following what I mean is, you know, basic principle in
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.440]   physics, you can't, you know, observe the spin and not affect
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.600]   the spin of the electron at the same time. I think the same
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.840]   thing applies to a relationship between the government and its
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.200]   people. And so I think part of the reason that people, I think
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.160]   I feel the same way about the FDA, by the way, I think people
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:54.920]   would be far more scrutinizing of the medicines they took, if
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   it didn't come with the crowding out effect of that
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.240]   individual level of self responsibility and due
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   diligence that the government wasn't doing. But now we live
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.800]   in the worst of all worlds where we have neither. The government's
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.680]   neither actually protecting nor actually providing the space for
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.560]   individual responsibility. I just wanted to hear, you know,
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.840]   you make a statement, you collect data, one in 100, you
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:17.800]   say you'll change your mind. I just want to understand with all
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.480]   the data, the past, the present, and probably who knows every
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.560]   every incremental day, we see something new. What is the full
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.960]   360 degree view that Vivek Ramaswamy has of Donald Trump?
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:33.240]   Full 360 degree view. Got it. Yeah, I actually haven't had a
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:39.160]   space to articulate this yet. So I think this is useful. So my
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.600]   view is that he was a successful president, measured by reviving
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:49.080]   the economy. It's like a present period. How, why do I say that?
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.240]   reviving the economy, growing the American economy. I think
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   that recognizing and speaking to and partially addressing
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:00.920]   concerns that had been historically unaddressed by both
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.360]   both major political parties. We did not enter a major war, we
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.560]   were on the brink of major conflict with North Korea, on
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.400]   the precipice and other parts of the world. ISIS was a thing it
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.520]   is, you know, by it exists, but it's by and large not the same
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.080]   threat that it was after his presidency as it was when he
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.120]   took over. These are major accomplishments, right? I think
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.280]   the immigration crisis, I think is far worse today, precisely
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.720]   because Biden's in office and not Trump. So I believe he was a
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.680]   successful president. That's view number one, view number two,
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:38.040]   he has an effect on people. About 30% of this country that I
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:44.840]   think becomes psychiatrically ill when he is the US. I think
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.720]   it's just a fact, right? agreeing with things that they
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.280]   otherwise wouldn't have agreed with because that 30% number
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:56.360]   applies on our pod to one and four. Well, I think that it's
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.280]   just the reality is people lose their ability to process
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.160]   information. People lose the ability to think independently.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.480]   It's like a demonic possession that happens in this country of
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.120]   about as best I can tell about 30% of the country. And I think
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.240]   that's not good for the country. And we can debate who's to blame
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.720]   for that or whatever. But I'm just stating it in observation
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:18.840]   that I feel pretty strongly about. And so I think most of
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.080]   Trump's policies were good. Do I have some policy disagreements
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.480]   with them? Of course I do. It'd be weird if any two people
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.560]   agreed on 100% of things. I would reenter the CPTPP. He
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.000]   exited the TPP. I think his exit of the TPP gives us a stronger
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.720]   negotiating position with Malaysia and Japan to you know,
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   fix some of the micro things that we might have wanted. China
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.000]   is not in the TPP. That's part of the path to actually declare
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.120]   economic independence from China. If it comes to that. We
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.640]   could go into a lot of different details. I would have
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.120]   rescinded the affirmative action executive order that Linden
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:48.280]   signed that I asked Trump's people why they didn't they
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.760]   said it was a political hill they didn't want to die on. I'd
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.560]   shut down the Department of Education. We can go on. But
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.920]   broadly, he was a successful president with whom I mostly
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.640]   agree on his broad policy vision, and especially his
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:00.200]   handling of foreign policy.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.800]   What did he get wrong? And what and was the election stolen?
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.640]   Yeah. So I mean, I gave you like small examples of what he
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.040]   got wrong. But I think the real care, the real thing that he
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.680]   got wrong. I'm not sure that getting wrong is the even
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.120]   framing. It's just a fact that 30% of this country became
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:20.600]   psychiatrically ill, and you're the leader of this country,
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.560]   you're leading a nation. And so you can decide whose fault that
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.560]   is. But I believe leaders are ultimately judged by their
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.240]   results. And for whatever reason, even when I'm saying
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.600]   the same things that Trump often did as a matter of policy or
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.640]   foreign policy, or domestic economic policy. Maybe it's
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.040]   because people don't, don't yet know me broadly, but I don't
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.920]   think that's it. Actually. I don't think I'm having that
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.920]   effect on people. And I think that that's why I'm in this
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.520]   race to carry forward unapologetic George Washington
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:54.840]   America First policies, and to do so more successfully, but
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.360]   also in a way that unites the country around that vision,
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:01.000]   more so than Donald Trump ever did or could in a second term,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.640]   was the election stole. Here's the sense in which I think the
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:09.320]   election was stolen in a data driven way. I have not seen any
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.520]   data to suggest that the ballot fraud or anything like that
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.760]   would have been sufficient to overturn the ballot count of
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:20.680]   the ballots. I've not seen any evidence to that effect. What I
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:27.480]   do see is hard evidence that people in this country would
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.800]   have elected a different president. Who's that?
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:37.560]   I like this is Tali. This is child number five. Number five.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.400]   She's cute. But number one in our hearts.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.080]   That's nice. All right. So what's your name?
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:48.200]   Are you? I would say Tali Tali. Tali. Hey, I'm away from my
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.840]   sons. These last few days. So I you know, I'm happy for you.
[00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.160]   Hopefully we'll be with our little guy soon. You know what
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.400]   I was saying is, let me get to the punchline. The sense in
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.320]   which the election was stolen was the Hunter Biden laptop
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:04.120]   story and the systematic suppression of information. I
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.880]   think that there is no doubt. No doubt. I think that the
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.000]   evidence strongly suggests that Trump would have been elected
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.680]   and not Biden had we actually a voter base that had access to
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.480]   that information. And I think that that is something that we
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.760]   ought to learn from. And I think that it does cast a lot of
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.440]   doubt and frustration on the legitimacy of the election.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.640]   Let me double click on that. You seem to have said on other
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.960]   programs, I've heard you at least a half dozen times talk
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:38.200]   about deep, deep state conspiracy, trying to frame
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.680]   Donald Trump, federal indictment of the 37 criminal charges for
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.680]   the stolen documents refusing to give them back. You got the
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:49.240]   New York case 34 more felony counts, we're about to have
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:53.160]   another one drop on January 6. You got the Georgia where he
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.120]   tried to get people to get 10,000 more votes. You got the
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   New York case where CFO is going to jail. You got him
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.080]   guilty of sexual assault. And then you got Latita James is
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.440]   suing the Trump organization of these seven are all seven a deep
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:13.160]   state conspiracy. I think it's it's a collective anaphylactic
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.600]   immune response to an antigen that challenged the system. I
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.320]   guess really what he did anything wrong, you're using all
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.520]   seven of these cases. He's Scott free. It's just I want to be
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.800]   really clear about something. I'm running for US President in
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.680]   this race against Donald Trump, because I'm the best position to
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.400]   lead this nation forward. And I was guilty of any of these
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.960]   seven, I would have made I would have made very different
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.120]   judgments than he did. But I think criminalizing bad
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.480]   judgments, especially when done so against political opponents
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.160]   in the midst of a presidential election, is an awful judgment
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.880]   for a US President and the Department of Justice
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.200]   underneath him to make. So you think that the Department of
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.840]   Justice and the person he put in charge of it, they're all
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.920]   conspiring, and that he didn't do anything wrong? Well, there's
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.880]   like a lot in that statement, right? Sure. Does he did he do
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:05.080]   things that I think are reprehensible that I wouldn't
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:08.280]   have done? Yeah, I think so. I mean, a lot of acts as they
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.760]   exist. Absolutely. Do I think that Biden and a lot of other
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:15.080]   politicians who have come have done things that I would have
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.120]   done differently and actually think were wrong decisions?
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.720]   Absolutely. But do I think that conflating a bad judgment with a
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:27.480]   breakage of law is a risk to our future? I think it is. Do you
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:31.080]   think he sent those people to? I mean, you just go on January
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.240]   6? I don't think he did. No, no, I think we need to march down
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.200]   there. And when he told the proud boys to stand by and stand
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.040]   back, you don't think that he was inciting them? Let me just
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:46.200]   say, I'm not here to defend Donald Trump's behavior. I'm
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.120]   running for US President. I think we need to but I think
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.520]   your opinion on it matters. I don't think my opinion on this
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.680]   matters. Yes, I want to be very clear about that the hat that
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   I'm wearing. I would not have done what he did. But he was
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.080]   very clear. I mean, you look at the transcripts, you run this
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.640]   by as I have First Amendment scholars just to check my
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.440]   inciting violence is not protected speech by the First
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:08.280]   Amendment. There's no sense in which when he tells people to
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.000]   peacefully make their way to the Capitol that does not meet any
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.440]   Supreme Court test for what constitutes inciting violence
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.080]   in this country. I think that let's just take this take the
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.240]   New York example. I mean, some of the stuff the details actually
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.480]   let's take the let's take the Oath Keepers one because that
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.680]   found roads hold on. First, hold on, let me get my first Oath
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.240]   Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes got 18 years. Do you think that
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.120]   the Justice Department did that? Because they're trying to
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.480]   frame Trump and you and Trump told the Oath Keepers to stand
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.280]   by and to stand back? Do you think he incited the Oath
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.120]   Keepers? Yes or no? Based on the facts that I have seen, I've
[01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.800]   seen no evidence of that. You're delusional. Okay. Yeah, I
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:50.920]   mean, that's delusional. Look, hold them to stand by. Okay, so
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.840]   I'm also there's also an indictment that hasn't been
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.320]   brought. So I've offered my opinion on the first two
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   indictments that have been brought against him, right? I
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.840]   read them. I read all 49 pages in the last one. I'm responsive
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.760]   to facts. Yeah. On the first two indictments. I think they're
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.080]   absolutely politically based in and I can go through the if
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.080]   you're interested, we can go into the specifics of it. I mean,
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.640]   it might be boring. I'll take your word. Yeah. You know, on
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.040]   New York, right? I mean, I'll just give you a line on each
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.760]   right. Okay. In New York. Let's take a fact that it's a state
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.680]   offense that was up charged to a felony and outside the statute
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.920]   of limitations, only by tying it to an alleged federal crime.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:32.840]   And what was that federal crime? Failing to report a hush
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.120]   money payment to a porn star as a campaign contribution. There
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.800]   would be a stronger case for using and paying hush money and
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.920]   using campaign funds to do it. That that was a federal campaign
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.680]   finance law violation, then not actually counting it. So so it
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.080]   so many counts. That's a politicized prosecution against
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.680]   anybody else. They wouldn't have brought it documents case. A
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.760]   49 page indictment read it twice. That does not once
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.040]   mention the Presidential Records Act, the most relevant
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.520]   statute that talks about what the basis is for President to
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:06.040]   keep documents or not, and instead charges him according to
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.840]   I think one of the most un-American laws in US history
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.120]   passed during World War One to silence World War One
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.400]   dissenters, including Eugene V. Debs, who Eugene V. Debs, who
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.480]   was actually put in prison over this. I have long argued that
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.120]   that was a statute that should have long been over should have
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.760]   been rescinded. That's now being used to charge a crime
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.400]   rather than eat more precise crime. So I tend to be very
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.120]   responsive, maybe to the point of frustration of being
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.400]   technical on these things, but I believe facts and law actually
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.000]   matter. I think that if Trump was the best guy for the job, I
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.240]   wouldn't be running in this race. If Ronald Reagan were
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.680]   alive and well today, I would not be running in this race.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.760]   Got it. So you're not a fan. I want to just go back to the I
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.000]   have a question. I have a question about these Trump
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.720]   scandals. Do you think that one of the seven? Well, I think do
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.240]   you think Trump should be indicted for Donald Trump Jr.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.040]   being paid $83,000 a month to serve on the board of a
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.840]   Ukrainian energy company, despite having no energy
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.800]   expertise? Oh, wait, that's Hunter and his personal life
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.240]   being in crisis because he's a drug addict. Him getting that
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.120]   job three months after his father approved a and backed a
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.200]   coup against the Ukrainian government. Do you think that
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.360]   Donald Trump Jr. should be investigated for that? And
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.920]   David, is this is this also after that Donald Trump then
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.280]   sends $200 billion of US taxpayer money to that very
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.080]   country, right after he's elected in office? I think
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.720]   that's the strongest of the scandals I've heard so far. So
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.840]   you believe Biden is a great way to say that. I'm a hunter
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.720]   Biden. Sorry. Well, it's just wrong grifters. What do you
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.200]   think of Jared Kushner getting taking down 2 billion from the
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:47.720]   Saudis after he walked out of the White House? I don't have
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.880]   that's not a matter that I have views on. You don't have views
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.280]   on that. But you got plenty of views on Trump. I got he's not
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.760]   in government. He's not in government. Okay, let's move on
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:06:00.360]   past Trump because this is a great example of why I'm in
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.480]   this race. I'm telling you this is there's something about the
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.880]   existence of Donald Trump exactly can't get away from
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.600]   criminal behavior that deflects our ability to behavior and
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.960]   trying to carry forward the agenda of this country, much of
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.640]   which was Trump's own agenda. So Vivek, in order to win this
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.120]   candidacy, and the reason I brought up the politico
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:23.240]   publication this morning, obviously, there was a bit of
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.800]   tongue in cheek on the effusiveness. But the key point
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.240]   being made was you have no chance of winning, and that you
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.440]   shouldn't be in the race at all. Now, look, I'd like that was
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.240]   the thesis of the piece. Yeah. But what's interesting is where
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.520]   it's coming from, right? It's coming from the establishment
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.200]   voice. And I think we'd like to hear just a little bit around
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.920]   your political strategy. What is your intention around building
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.200]   bridges and ties to the Republican establishment to
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.040]   support your candidacy here? Or does the or does the Republican
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.080]   establishment largely sit on the sidelines right now and wait
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.760]   to see who emerges with this popular movement and who's out
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.720]   there, you're obviously running an incredible campaign on the
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.800]   road, very active, very vocal. And as everyone says, probably
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.000]   by far the most articulate and most thoughtful and most
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.680]   intelligent of the candidates in the race today, but lacking
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.960]   experience, lacking connections, not part of the
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.400]   establishment, and as a result, cast in this negative light,
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.160]   consistently by the by these sorts of writers. So what is
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.240]   your strategy to win this race? Given the is it not important,
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.040]   as Trump showed in the last election cycle to have those
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.160]   Republican establishment ties? Or are you going to be building
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.560]   bridges? And then my follow up question is, if you don't win,
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.200]   what are you going to do?
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:45.800]   Yeah, so let me, let me address the first, it's basically in the
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.440]   camp that I don't think it's the voters that ultimately matter,
[01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:52.280]   not the people who have appointed themselves in the
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.360]   reigning establishment, or it's not even the establishment
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.680]   anymore. It's an outdated establishment that I don't think
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.080]   actually is going to influence meaningfully the result of this
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.160]   election, except for one respect, which is money, which
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.440]   I'll get back to. So the area where we're punching above our
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.200]   weight, right, debates haven't even happened yet. In at least
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.960]   in the last week, I'm third in most of the national polls. This
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.240]   is well ahead of even where we planned to be, right, we planned
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.720]   to be in third by November, December ahead of the Iowa
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.440]   caucuses, ahead of New Hampshire, overperform
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:24.680]   expectations, and both of those use the momentum to then win the
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.240]   race. That was broadly the strategy with the debate stage
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.480]   as the plate as the way where I would steadily work my way into
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.080]   that. I think we're just now on a different curve, where, you
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.400]   know, we might be in second place by then and by a smaller
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.440]   margin than people expected. I think the debate stage is
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:41.720]   critical. The campaign strategy is actually to combine the
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.760]   initial investment that because I've lived the American dream
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.880]   I've was able to make, but to combine that with a true
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   grassroots uplift. We've got close to 70,000, maybe more, I
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.280]   have to check the exact numbers, unique donors already,
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:57.160]   you know, former, you know, vice presidents or other candidates
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.200]   that are, you know, well on their way and struggling by some
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.240]   measures to get to 40,000, which is the threshold for the first
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.840]   debate. So our strategy is very much a grassroots strategy. I've
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.120]   done more campaign events than anybody in the Republican field.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.360]   And so this is our strategy is very grassroots driven. So I'm
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.120]   punching above my weight in terms of events, unique
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.080]   donations, polling. The one area where I'm punching below weight
[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.600]   is large scale donations. So we are not raising mass numbers of
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.840]   large check external funds yet into the campaign. My super
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.080]   PACs, or I don't even, I mean, whatever, they're independent
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.040]   expenditures. I don't, there's an entity that exists out there
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.240]   that's been affiliated with me has, based on public reports,
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.440]   tiny amounts of money compared to those that are supporting an
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.680]   all in for candidates from Tim Scott to Rhonda Sannes. And
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.040]   that's also a reality, right? I think that that comes with
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.120]   competitive advantages and disadvantages. They're two sides
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.040]   of the same coin. I think I am at liberty, total liberty. I
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.240]   feel totally unconstrained to pursue the strategy that David
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.760]   mentioned earlier, which is that I'm reacting in real time to
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.800]   what I believe. Have you been surprised by the lack of
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:18.680]   clarity, maybe of the DeSantis campaign in really creating a
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.480]   pathway through Trump? And if you are surprised, what do you
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.680]   think he's doing wrong? If you had to critique it? Yeah, I'm
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.200]   not surprised because I know him and I think he's a good
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.280]   executor, right? I think he has been, I disagree with some
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.040]   other people on this. I think he's been quite an effective
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:40.520]   governor. I think that when you're talking about, and Scott
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.880]   Walker in the last cycle was quite an effective governor. And
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.440]   for the same reasons that people believed Scott Walker was
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.400]   going to be the runaway nominee last time around, I think that
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.600]   people naturally gravitate. People think they want somebody
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.120]   who has done something as an effective executor. But when it
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:59.080]   comes to the US presidency, I think it's a unique role where
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:02.680]   what matters is actually having a vision for where we are going.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:07.880]   Right? And so I'm not, without saying things that are
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.040]   interpreted as being mean about somebody else or not, I know all
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.600]   of these people, I've known them for a long time. I've shared
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.440]   stages with them over the course of my Woke Inc book tour and
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.520]   Nation of Victims book tour. I'm not surprised with how
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.400]   things are going in this race. I said we expected to be where
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.520]   we are in November. We're here in July. I'm not surprised that
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.400]   we're doing well. I understand how audiences across this
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.200]   country responded to my message in Woke Inc. I'm not surprised
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   that they're continuing to respond well to Trump. I think
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.760]   there's nothing surprising about where we are in this race right
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.000]   now. And so you're not surprised because because
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.360]   DeSantis is a competent administrator, but that is a
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.440]   great job as governor, but not the bill of goods for the
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.240]   president. I'm really at a point in this race from I want
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.280]   to focus on this, but to be honest with you, I think I
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.040]   think there's a lot of truth to what you said. Yeah. Don't you
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.600]   think part of it, though, is that Trump has singled out
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.760]   DeSantis as the one candidate who he's gonna beat the hell out
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.000]   of? I mean, I don't think so, David, actually, I'll tell you
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.920]   why. It's true, right? He has not attacked you. Trump's
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.560]   actually said good things about you. Yeah, he's not attacked
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.680]   anybody else in this race. Yeah, exactly. Have you spent
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.000]   time with Trump? I know all these guys. I know. Have you
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.080]   spent time with Trump? When's the last time you talked to him?
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.000]   Not a serious amount of time. I've spent more time with
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.920]   DeSantis than I have with Trump. Have you spent over an
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.200]   hour with Trump? Once, yeah. This is long before I was
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.640]   running for president, but we had dinner. Has his people ever
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.720]   reached out and tried to build bridges with you? We've talked
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.880]   backstage. I mean, most of us when we intersect each other
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.360]   were speaking at the same forums, the NRA, the family
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.680]   leader thing that Tucker did backstage. We have interactions
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.840]   with all the other candidates. I'd like to think I'm friendly
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.040]   with everybody. You know, I don't know how, you know, I
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.280]   haven't talked to Ron recently, but I've talked to him more
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.400]   before. But I think the reality is, so Dave, what you said is
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.480]   definitely true. And I'm not in this to be a political
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.760]   analyst, right? I'm in this to state what my beliefs are, say
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.640]   who I am and people can vote for me or not. But I actually do
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.920]   think, I don't think that Trump's commentary on the other
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:10.040]   candidates is having so much of an effect. I think voters, many
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.840]   people who were maybe initially behind DeSantis, I know many of
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.320]   them were people who are part of that traditional
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.480]   establishment that didn't want, that most of them didn't want
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.280]   to have nothing to do with Trump, but decided that was the
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.520]   next best thing. So I don't think that Trump's attacks are
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.320]   going to persuade them one way or another. I think it comes
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.920]   down to the study of what happened in 2016. Scott Walker,
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.880]   great governor, really respected guy. And I like what he's doing
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.040]   in his post elected office life as well. But everybody has a
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.160]   role to play in reviving this country. And I think we all have
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.800]   to look ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves, how are we
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.400]   going to make our unique contribution? And I think it's
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.480]   going to require governors who are effective implementers of a
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.400]   vision that makes their states thrive. I think Governor DeSantis
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.080]   has done a really good job of that. I think Kristi Noem has
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.520]   done a really good job of that. I think there are people who
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.960]   hopefully will continue to have an impact on our culture outside
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.520]   of government altogether. There's a really important role
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.760]   for that. And Jason, I think that's my answer to your other
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.000]   question, which I forgot to answer.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.680]   Can I go back to two things that you mentioned just in passing,
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.520]   but I just want you to clarify your thoughts on them. One, as
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:20.120]   you said, you would abolish the Department of Education. And I
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.480]   thought I'd never heard anybody say that, really. So could you
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.320]   just expand on that what you mean? And then the second, I'd
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.000]   love for you to talk about some of these Supreme Court decisions
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.400]   that have come in the last little while, specifically, the
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.600]   abortion debate, the affirmative action debate, the rights of
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:44.520]   businesses to not service people whose ideology they disagree
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.560]   with. And then, sorry, the third point is maybe use that last
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.280]   part as a jumping off point. I'd love for you to understand
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:57.000]   your position on LGBTQ, the role of the trans movement, what's
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.800]   happening in schools. Those are the three kind of big, chunky
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.680]   areas that I think are worth talking about, if you can just
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.400]   give a few minutes.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.320]   Yeah, there's a lot there. So let me, if I skip over
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.760]   something, bring me back. So Department of Education, I think
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.000]   the federal government is not as a factual matter directly
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.880]   involved in education. I think it is a therefore a deadweight
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.080]   waste for money to cycle from the taxpayers to the federal
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.240]   Department of Education to then disperse those funds
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.360]   inefficiently as they do. Tilting the scales to four-year
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.480]   college degrees over choices that people might have otherwise
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:32.360]   made that are better choices for them. Vocational training,
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.880]   one-year, two-year programs. Using it as a cudgel, and this
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.840]   relates to the latter issue you asked about, to tell local
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.880]   schools they don't get that money unless they're adopting
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.840]   what I certainly view as toxic racial and gender ideology-
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.520]   based agendas. They use the money as a cudgel to do it. So
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:51.320]   I've said that that department that spends about $80 billion
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.760]   of taxpayer money, I'll shut it down. Tonight in New Hampshire,
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.640]   I'm laying out the anatomy of exactly how we'll shut it down.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.080]   And then return that money to the states, to the people, put
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.760]   it in parents' pockets. Very specifically, you have to be a
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.880]   state that has a school choice program in order to receive that
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.840]   Department of Education shutdown dividend. I think that if
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.480]   you're such a state, I would also believe that those states
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.240]   need to write their teachers' union, teachers' contracts in a
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.520]   way that stop teachers from joining teachers' unions, which
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.480]   I think have been a destructive force on our public schools.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.120]   If you're unionizing against the public, think about who
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.280]   you're unionizing against, the very kids you're supposed to
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.320]   represent. Now we have transparency, we have choice. If
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.440]   you teach it in the classroom, put it online. And then there's
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:37.480]   an interesting fact in this country where I think you guys
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.680]   will appreciate how bizarre this fact really is. There's not
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.320]   only like a failed positive correlation, there is a negative
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.320]   correlation, an inverse correlation between how much
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.640]   money per student a public school spends and the actual
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.440]   outcomes that that school achieves for its students. So in
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:03.720]   my version of school choice, my preferred version, it would not
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.000]   just be that parents get to get these vouchers and educational
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   savings accounts to send their kids to some other school.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.880]   That's part of the story. It's a first step. But I think any
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:16.840]   parent who moves to a school that spends less per student,
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.120]   which we know based on the data is actually almost equal to a
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.160]   better performing school as it relates to achievement, should
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.960]   be able to take half the delta with them. So let's take
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.760]   Chicago or Pennsylvania spending $35,000, $40,000 per
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.480]   student. Fifteen miles away, you have a school spending $15,000
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.840]   to $20,000 per student. I think they should be able to take half
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.960]   the difference that $10,000 to $15,000, half that difference of
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.120]   the $20,000 to $10,000 they take with them. You run the math on
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.680]   normal investment returns. You're talking about a quarter
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.800]   million dollar plus graduation gift when that kid graduates
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.480]   from 12th grade. So you tell me which is a better use of money.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:54.360]   It's not even close. And I think the head of the state
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:56.200]   That's a great idea.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.400]   That's a great, great, great idea.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.560]   Did you come up with that idea? Or did is that something
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.280]   that's not there? I think it was actually another guy's an
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.160]   arbitrageur who's a friend but who shares similar instincts.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.360]   And like, I'm like, I'm a value investor. I believe in market
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.560]   great, great incentive, which is makes sense in the world.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.200]   Yeah. Okay, let's move past education.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.320]   Yeah, I want to talk about the specific the gay and the trans
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.600]   issue. Two questions. One, do you think it's normal to be gay?
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.520]   And you have any problem with people being gay? And then
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:28.120]   No, I do not have a basis, etc. No problem. So then the second,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.000]   of course, talking about trans, I heard you on meet the press,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.240]   say that trans was a mental disorder, which Yeah, you know,
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.120]   it wasn't the DSM four, I guess, or whatever the latest one was,
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:42.360]   yeah, just a couple years ago, and now it's changed. So maybe
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.320]   explain why you think differently about those two
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.520]   things. One, you think it's fine to be gay, but you think it's a
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.080]   mental disorder in all likelihood, if people want to
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:51.580]   transit.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.280]   Yeah, so you know, I want to leave you with a good sense of
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.600]   where I'm at on on these issues, right? So I think it's at least
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:08.440]   curious that we take the LGBTQ plus value set and vision for
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.200]   what the movement stands for, it does require you to adopt
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.640]   simultaneously conflicting beliefs at once. Right? The gay
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.800]   rights movement was predicated on the idea, which I'm quite
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:22.840]   sympathetic to, that the sex of the person that you're attracted
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.440]   to is hardwired on the day you're born. But now with the T
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.960]   component of that same movement that now says your own gender is
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.360]   completely fluid over the course of your own life. And I think
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.360]   we're not going to observe the tension between these two
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.440]   observations. I think that we're purposefully having our head
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.440]   stuck in the sand. I think what's happening in many cases,
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:44.120]   somebody who claims to be trans is really just gay. And part of
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.200]   what we're saying is it's not okay to be gay. So to answer
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.680]   your first question, part of what the trans movement is
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:51.080]   effectively telling people is that it's not okay to be gay.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.680]   You know, who else says that? Iran. Actually, Iran is a nation
[01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:56.920]   that if you are gay, they force you to undergo gender
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.120]   conversion surgery. It's not that different than what's baked
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.760]   into the ideological premise of much of the trans movement here.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.800]   And so I just want you to come from the fact there's a lot of
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.920]   people in the GOP who will offer surface level stuff here. I've
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:13.880]   spent a lot of time thinking about this. Gender dysphoria is
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.000]   what I've said is a mental health disorder. I've been very
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.960]   precise. Let's take the intersex case out of it. Klinefelter
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.880]   syndrome, Jacob's syndrome, right? Klinefelter is XXY.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.320]   Jacob's syndrome is XYY. These are ultra rare. They exist.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:33.000]   They're real. For the purpose of our discussion, though it's
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.080]   under the broad trans umbrella, I'm going to take that out of
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.240]   it because that's not a mental health disorder. That's a
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:43.080]   genetic reality. But now let's go back to the conflicting
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.480]   supposition. There's no gay gene, yet the sex of the person
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.800]   you're attracted to, we accept for civil rights purposes, is
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.920]   hard right on the day you're born. Yet there are X and Y
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.520]   chromosomes, and yet your own biological sex/gender is now
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.840]   completely fluid over the course of your life. There's a
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.440]   tension there. And I think that tension is best explained by the
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:03.960]   way we've treated it for most of our national history, for most
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.200]   of our medical history, all the way through actually I think the
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.280]   DSM-5, not just the four, as a mental health condition. And I
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.120]   think the compassionate thing to do is not to affirm, especially
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.360]   when it's a kid, to affirm a kid's confusion. I think the
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.560]   compassionate thing to do is to recognize that there's some
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.520]   other psychological struggle manifesting itself in this form.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.520]   And it is cruel to affirm that kid's confusion. I met two
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.680]   young women, Chloe and Katie. And by affirm we mean surgery or
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.160]   hormone therapy.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.000]   Surgery, hormone therapy, exactly.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.760]   So you would limit that to when you're an adult 18 years old?
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.000]   Yes.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.480]   And you would ban parents?
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.400]   There's two women I met here in New Hampshire, literally like
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.880]   where I am right now, who are in their 20s that badly regret
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.040]   undergoing double mastectomies. One of them underwent a
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.240]   hysterectomy. Both of them underwent puberty blockers.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.560]   So even if the parents and doctors agreed with it, you
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.400]   would say they can't make that decision for the child?
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.480]   Just like you can't get a tattoo before the age of 18 in most,
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:04.600]   what we say is a decision that you are likely to regret, in
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:07.800]   many cases at least, likely to regret later in life. We let you
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.880]   make that decision as an adult. And I do believe we live in a
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.920]   free society. As an adult, you're free to identify how you
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.360]   want, a free to wear what you want. But kids aren't the same
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:21.160]   as adults. And even among adults, there's a difference
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.440]   between living your life freely and expecting that everybody
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:31.080]   else changes their linguistic and traditional understandings
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.640]   in sports and traditional understandings in locker rooms
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.840]   and traditional understandings in language. That's a
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.760]   difference. And so I don't believe in a tyranny of the
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760]   majority, but I don't believe in a tyranny of the minority
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.480]   either. Do you think this topic is over indexed on right now?
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.720]   And is a really important topic presidency? Or do you think
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.920]   this is like some sort of culture wars thing that this
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.640]   actually isn't that important to the national discussion should
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.280]   be held privately? I appreciate you asking that, Jason is, I
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.760]   think I feel this way about a lot of the topics, right from
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:04.680]   racial position on that. I think like, why is this the most
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:08.280]   important topic? Yeah, this is this is interesting. Because
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.960]   it's a symptom is interesting, only to the extent that it is a
[01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:17.080]   symptom of the deeper void of the deeper vacuum. And I think
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.640]   the mental health epidemic is not limited to gender dysphoria,
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:24.360]   anxiety, depression, drug usage, fentanyl, suicide, these
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.680]   let's have the conversation more holistically, these are
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.320]   symptoms of the deeper void. And all I care about is running
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.640]   through these topics without somebody holding the line of
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.520]   defense by stopping us to get to a discussion about that void
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:39.400]   to say no, this is exactly what that kid is. And you're wrong
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.800]   to think about as a mental health disorder. I think that's
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:44.440]   unproductive, because it stops us from getting to the truth.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.560]   Over the years, it's been the case that young people tend to
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:54.120]   orient to being counter cultural, or anti establishment.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:59.080]   Generally speaking, it's part of the psychological seasoning
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.360]   of a human to be against the parents against the system and
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.080]   ultimately to create independence for oneself. And
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.200]   that's typically counter to what what came before it. And it
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.480]   has manifested in every generation, with this point of
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.280]   view that there is some psychological torment that has
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.200]   taken over the young people that is causing them to act out
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.240]   from beatniks, to hippies, to punks, to goth, to emo, and
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.600]   every generation had some cultural representation is your
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.240]   point of view that gender dysphoria is the current
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.560]   manifestation of that pattern of behavior that we've seen over
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.320]   the generations. That's not exactly my view. My view is
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.800]   that it's not limited to young people. I think there's
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.840]   something unique going on in America right now. It's true of
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:49.000]   all of us. There's some sense, some of this comes from
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.800]   self-reflection, but I think it's true for most of us that
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.960]   we're hungry to be part of something bigger than ourselves.
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.480]   Yet we cannot even answer what it means to be an American, or
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.320]   what it means to believe in God or what God is. And we have
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.600]   come up with new false idols that substitute for that. So
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.000]   I'm talking about generational history. I mean, you know,
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   Moses, by the time he comes down from the mountaintop, you
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.200]   got the golden calf, Israelites are lost in the desert. They
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.680]   say they want to go back and be ruled by the Pharaoh. Yeah, I
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:22.440]   think that the historical trend I'm talking about is a
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.400]   slightly different one, and maybe has a longer arc to it
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.720]   than the one you're talking about. But I, but my diagnosis
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.840]   is not specific to young people. It's specific to where
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:36.280]   we are in a national history, when like a bunch of blind
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.400]   bats in a cave, right? How does a bat figure out where it is?
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.920]   It sends out echolocation signals, sonar signals that
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.280]   come back and say, this is where I am. I think we human
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:50.120]   beings are wired to do the same thing. And the pillars, the
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.160]   walls, the fixed points of truth from family to faith, to
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.760]   patriotism, to hard work, to individual pride, the things
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.360]   that used to ground us, when those things disappear, we're
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.680]   now sending out these signals and then nothing's coming back.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.280]   And so we're making up new pillars instead. And maybe one
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.920]   of them is a trans flag. And maybe one of them is a Ukraine
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.760]   flag. And maybe one of them is a climate cult. And maybe one of
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.120]   them is a racial intersectional hierarchy. And maybe one of
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:23.240]   them is fentanyl. But I think that that's I do have a deep
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.240]   point of agreement with you and Jason that I think we sometimes
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.040]   get too hung up both sides, maybe Republicans a lot so
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.960]   right now, on the symptoms, without getting to a deeper
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.960]   discussion of the deeper cancer, the deeper void that we need to
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.320]   fill. And that's what I'm interested in.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:42.040]   Chamath brought up the Roe v. Wade issue. I'm wondering, what
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.480]   do you think is the most productive path forward for the
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:50.600]   country, in terms of reasonable right to choose versus right to
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.040]   life argument, because you personally feel that abortion
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.160]   should be banned? Am I correct?
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.720]   I am personally pro life.
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.800]   You're pro life. So you don't believe I'll be able to get an
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.120]   abortion under any circumstances? Or do you have
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:02.600]   rape and sex?
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:05.240]   My view, as someone who's running for US President
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.200]   responding to the question about the Supreme Court case, is that
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:11.400]   Roe v. Wade was correct to be overturned on constitutional
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:11.880]   grounds.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.360]   Okay, fine.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.240]   It was, it was made up.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.480]   It's a legal argument. How do you personally feel?
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.200]   But it leads also to the path for moving forward, which is
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.800]   that I think the federal government should stay out of
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:23.320]   it. And so there's a discussion amongst Republicans, I think I'm
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:27.320]   the only Republican candidate in this field, who has come out
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.160]   and said that I would not support a federal abortion ban of
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.840]   any kind, on principled ground, because to me, I am grounded in
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.120]   constitutional principles.
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.680]   And I think there's no legal basis for the federal government
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.800]   to legislate here.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:44.360]   The 10th Amendment says that part of the American experiment
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.680]   is we have diversity across states.
[01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.680]   And I think this is a state issue.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:53.640]   Now, at the level of the states, I'm personally a believer that
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.000]   unborn life is life.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.680]   I think that the pro-life movement needs to, we need to
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:59.960]   walk the walk.
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.960]   When it comes to being pro-life, what do I mean?
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.080]   I'm pro-contraception.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.760]   I'm pro-adoption.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.960]   I'm pro-childcare.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.560]   I'm pro-more sexual responsibility for men, for God's
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.880]   sake, we live in an era of genetic tests.
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:14.200]   We can actually put more responsibility on men.
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.520]   This doesn't have to be and should not be a men's versus
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.480]   women's rights issue.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.880]   And nobody on our side is really talking about these issues.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.840]   I do, because I don't think this has to be as divisive as we've
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:23.560]   made it out to be.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.240]   But I can almost prove to you that more people in this country
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.160]   share my instincts than are willing to admit it.
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.400]   There's a case, Clarence Thomas brought it up, of a pregnant
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.680]   woman walking down the street.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.120]   She's assaulted.
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:40.040]   The unborn child dies as a result.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:44.360]   I haven't met, and I have many liberal friends, most of my
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.600]   friends growing up have been, have different political
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.720]   persuasions than I have now.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.160]   I haven't met a single one of my liberal friends or otherwise
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.400]   who says that that criminal does not deserve liability for that
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:57.720]   death.
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.440]   And so I just think more of us share these common instincts.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.520]   If one state wants to ban it, they can ban it.
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.440]   If another state wants to have a 24 week rule, they could have a
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:07.240]   24 week rule.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.480]   That's that you are like other Republican candidates, I will
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.360]   not be signing a federal abortion ban on constitutional
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:12.920]   grounds.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.200]   And I remain open to persuasion.
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:17.320]   If some legal scholar convinces me that the US Constitution
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.120]   gives the federal government the authority to sign that into
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.160]   law, so be it.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.760]   But I have not been so convinced.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.160]   And I think many other principled constitutionalists
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.720]   haven't been convinced, even though the other Republican
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:30.360]   field has all, best of every other candidate in this race
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.160]   has said they would sign one.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.040]   What is your thought on just the gross tonnage of dollars that
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:40.360]   we spend on the military and defense and espionage and, you
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.320]   know, internal, external security?
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.760]   And then when those bump up against civil liberties, just
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.720]   give us your kind of framing on how you think about those sets
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.480]   of issues around national level security, but where and
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.160]   personal, personal privacy.
[01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.920]   So I'm, I, for more of my life than not identified as a
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.600]   libertarian than a conservative.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.400]   And I still have all of those libertarian instincts in my
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.200]   core.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.080]   It's just that I care about more issues than libertarians
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.320]   care about, because libertarianism is all about the
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.240]   relationship between the state and the individual.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:14.200]   And I actually do care about culture and the fabric of the
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   society outside of government too.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.680]   It's a long way of saying I'm deeply skeptical of the
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.440]   national security establishment.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.480]   I was deeply skeptical of the Iraq war at the time.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.560]   I think I am today in retrospect.
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.360]   I was deeply skeptical that prisoners in Guantanamo Bay
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.760]   should have been denied constitutional due process
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   rights when that's exactly what enshrines the justice system
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.960]   that we otherwise believe in.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.840]   I would pardon Julian Assange.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.760]   I would pardon Edward Snowden.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:45.000]   I've committed to a long list of pardons of people who have
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.880]   taken steps to expose corruption that we otherwise
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.880]   would not have seen in this country.
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.920]   And I think part of the reason why is there's a weird
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.800]   corporate analogy here.
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:56.600]   We're talking about companies and finding their purpose
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.320]   and Coinbase.
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.560]   I think there's a version of that going on in the US
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:00.060]   military.
[01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:04.200]   I think the US military has lost its sense of purpose
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:04.700]   actually.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:08.200]   And so my view is the purpose of the US military is to secure
[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.040]   Americans on American soil to make sure that we, when
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:14.440]   necessary, win wars and more importantly, deter wars.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.800]   And I think part of what you see in the loss of people
[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:19.720]   complain about wokeness in the military, et cetera, these
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.760]   are again, symptoms of a deeper loss of purpose of an
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:24.680]   institution, not that much different than a company.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.960]   But my view is I'm not in the same way with the immigration
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.520]   debate.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:29.640]   I don't engage in this.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   What's the cap, you know, higher or lower?
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:34.520]   It's the wrong debate.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.360]   Merit, purpose, what are we achieving?
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.640]   I feel the same way about the military.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.400]   It's not a higher, lower discussion.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.160]   It's a what are we doing discussion?
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:44.920]   And I think there is a legitimate case for the US to
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:47.160]   have and continue to have the strongest military in the
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:47.660]   world.
[01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:52.680]   But I think that deputizing that military to fight wars that
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.320]   are really deflection tactics, often for our own ailments at
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   home, I think has been a mistake.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.760]   And we're at risk of making those same mistakes again,
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.960]   right now, most pertinently in Ukraine, unless we learn from
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.760]   those past mistakes.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:07.560]   I want to ask you about the division within the Republican
[01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.400]   Party on this, specifically Ukraine.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.040]   So at turning point, which you just spoke out, and I think
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.880]   you did very well in the straw poll there, you had Tucker
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:20.600]   interviewing Mike Pence, asking him, why should we prioritize
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:25.000]   Ukraine over our own cities that are increasingly broken
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.360]   down, you've got homeless people living on the streets, you've
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.400]   got this crisis of drug addiction, you've got rampant
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.480]   crime, you've got schools that are terrible.
[01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:39.400]   And yet, Ukraine seems to be this fixation of the unit party
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.720]   in Washington, and Pence gave this totally dunderheaded
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.400]   answer, something like that's not my concern.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:50.680]   Which I guess his apologist said afterwards that well, no, he
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.520]   was talking about something else.
[01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.160]   He wasn't saying that American cities weren't his concern,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:59.000]   which even if you grant that was the case means that he wasn't
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.560]   really paying attention to Tucker's question.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:05.880]   But then you also had Tim Scott say something, it was
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:09.640]   definitely better phrase than what Pence said, but basically
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.640]   said that he thought it was a good idea for us to be giving
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:16.040]   all this money to Ukraine, because degrading Russia's
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.080]   military was a good deal for the United States, you know, by
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.840]   which degrade, I assume means killing Russian boys.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:25.880]   And you've heard Lindsey Graham say this sort of thing.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.840]   Then I had this Republican pollster named Patrick Rafini,
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.520]   who I didn't really know before, but he's apparently a
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.400]   Republican pollster.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.640]   He's got Slava Ukrainian his bio.
[01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.240]   I'm not quite sure what's motivating that.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:42.520]   But he tweeted at me saying that Ukraine is like number
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:46.280]   17 on the list of GOP voter priorities, despite efforts
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.000]   by the likes of Carlson and Sachs to make it a thing.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.280]   Notice how it almost never gets brought up on the trail
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.480]   unless Tucker is there.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:57.880]   My response to him was to post a quote from Mitch McConnell
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:02.200]   saying that Ukraine is the number one priority of the GOP.
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.240]   I'm like, you're making my point for me.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.480]   I know that it's number 17 in the eyes of voters in our
[01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.600]   party in terms of what they think we should be focused on.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:17.240]   But it's number one in the minds of Mitch McConnell and
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:22.040]   Pence and Scott and Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham.
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:24.120]   These people are obsessed with this idea.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:28.040]   So I guess, A, what is your reaction to that?
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.960]   B, how are we going to change this?
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.120]   I mean, it just seems like there's something fundamentally
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.760]   broken in our party when the base understands that we should
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.800]   not be focused on Ukraine, focused on our own borders,
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.560]   our own cities, as opposed to some far away lands, borders
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.600]   and cities.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:50.040]   And then also in that same turning point poll, 95% of the
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.120]   attendees that conference were opposed to US involvement in
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.240]   Ukraine.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.280]   It was the single highest number for anything they pulled
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:58.600]   on.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.680]   I think Trump got like an 85% approval.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.240]   Opposition to Ukraine got 95%.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.600]   So clearly, there is a fundamental divide between what
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.120]   the establishment or elite of the party thinks and what the
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:10.760]   base thinks.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.800]   Yep.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.160]   What is your explanation for that?
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:14.520]   And how does that ever get solved?
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.840]   I mean, how are we going to fix it?
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.680]   I'm going to give you a facile answer, David.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:22.360]   It has to do with why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:24.760]   I want to be elected the next president.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.640]   I think I will be.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.440]   And I think reflecting the will of the people in the way this
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.560]   country is governed, is part of how our system is actually
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.360]   supposed to work, both in the primary and in the general
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:34.840]   election.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.960]   And so, you know, we're sitting in different seats, but I'm
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:41.240]   sitting in the seat that I am now precisely because I think
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.320]   somebody needs to actually step up and fix it.
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.520]   When most of the Republican Party has lock, stock and barrel
[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.800]   for all their criticisms of Biden on the most important
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.960]   foreign policy matter of right now, have lock, stock and barrel
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.920]   adopted what is effectively the Biden position, which is
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.200]   mysterious and it's interesting.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:07.000]   Now, I think that it has become a sort of a fixation, not
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.440]   because these candidates, I think have arrived at this
[01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:13.880]   viewpoint independently through reasoning their way to it,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.360]   but just understanding that that's what they are supposed
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.320]   to say in the tradition of a party that was historically
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.520]   based on projecting hard power through deterring the USSR,
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.840]   not recognizing the fact that people sometimes seem to forget
[01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.160]   this fact, the USSR doesn't exist anymore.
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.520]   And NATO, which was created to contain the USSR has now
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.040]   expanded far more after the fall of the USSR than it did
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:41.560]   before, which is itself a symptom of a Republican Party
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.600]   that still sometimes it's like a knee jerk.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.200]   It's like a knee jerk militarism.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.040]   It's like, it's a muscle memory.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.360]   What about the influence of the military industrial complex?
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.600]   Do you think somehow like it's related to donors?
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.640]   Like, what do you mean?
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:59.000]   Yeah, so I'm a, I'm very open-minded too.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.240]   And I'm getting the signal that, so we're going to this
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:07.320]   event where we're meeting with parents of kids who have died
[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.520]   as a consequence of fentanyl.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:13.400]   And I don't want to keep them waiting longer than we need to.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.280]   But if you guys are down to do this again, this has been a lot
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:16.520]   of fun.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.080]   No, it's been great.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.200]   You gave us 90 minutes.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:18.840]   It's fantastic.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.160]   We can wrap it up.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.280]   Let me just answer David's last, what was your last question?
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.800]   Wait, no, no, I have a better question.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.840]   Just that last question.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.120]   Number one, are you vaccinated against COVID?
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:30.680]   Number two, what do you think of Fauci?
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.480]   And what could we have done differently?
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.680]   I mean, you're a man of science.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:37.800]   So I'm just curious what you think about the whole thing.
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:38.360]   Great question.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.840]   So I am vaccinated against COVID.
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:44.680]   Had I had the facts that I do now as a young, thankfully healthy
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.960]   male, I would not have actually chosen to get vaccinated.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:56.040]   I think that Anthony Fauci betrays science by substituting the scientific method,
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.760]   which depends on free speech and open debate and inquiry with authority,
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:03.400]   which is actually fundamentally anti-scientific at its core.
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:07.240]   And I think one of our main lessons to have learned from the pandemic,
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:12.040]   and I hope we do learn it in the future, is that it is precisely in times of emergency
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.280]   that free speech becomes most important.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.160]   I think if we had been able to debate in the open, the merits of lockdowns for children,
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.320]   we would not have locked down our schools.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.960]   I think we had been able to debate in the open what the origin of the pandemic was.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.400]   A lab in Wuhan appears to be the overwhelming, it's the truth.
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.880]   I mean, we know that that's exactly the most likely to be correct explanation.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.760]   It's in the name.
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.840]   It literally is.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.240]   But it was a name you couldn't have said at the end.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.600]   You couldn't call it, you couldn't name the unspeakable city for which the virus originated.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.320]   So I think one of the top lessons is free speech and open debate,
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.080]   the path to truth runs through that.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:47.400]   Science depends on the free exchange of ideas.
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.200]   That's who we are.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.800]   And the beauty is our country is founded on that very principle.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.040]   It's in the First Amendment for a reason.
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:56.520]   We'll let you get to your event.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.720]   But I just want to say thank you for being incredibly dynamic and open and honest.
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:07.960]   It's really great to have guys like you to talk to.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.800]   I appreciate it, guys.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.400]   If you guys want to do it again, I had a lot of fun too.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:13.240]   So yeah, I just want to add, I just got a rock.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:17.800]   Thanks for not being like political politicians speak and being so honest
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.240]   and taking on every single topic we asked you about every single topic.
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.280]   That's really very candid.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:23.320]   I think you did a great job.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.440]   I appreciate it, guys.
[01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:25.720]   Appreciate you guys.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.220]   Thanks for that.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.880]   We didn't talk about this.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.320]   Did you guys mention where you are?
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.480]   Or is that off limits based on the number of buttons here?
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.680]   I can tell you I'm in.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:37.080]   I can't you know what I can't talk to myself.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.800]   Because, you know, did I ever tell you the story about
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.520]   two years ago when I was in Italy and the stalkers?
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.760]   You fucking told everybody you were there.
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.840]   You know, I didn't everybody was at Chamat's Beach Club.
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.360]   I took a picture of the ocean.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.000]   It was ridiculous.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.040]   I took a picture of the ocean.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:56.120]   And in the corner of one of the towels was the logo of Chamat's Beach Club.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:03.800]   And some guys found that logo on the towel, did a Google image reverse search,
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.680]   found the beach club that Chamat's part of, and then showed up at the beach club.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.920]   Well, I was drinking $150 bottles per second on Chamat's account to pitch me their startup.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.560]   So I don't want to say exactly where I am, but I'm in Italy.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.360]   Where are you guys?
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.200]   Me and Saks are at shouting distance from each other.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.720]   We're about to see each other after this.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.160]   Did I ever tell you guys the story about last summer when I was in Italy?
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.440]   Chamath and I were walking down the streets of Milan.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.520]   Did I ever tell the story?
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.080]   No, no, no.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:31.800]   You didn't tell the story.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.120]   Okay.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:35.960]   This was like the last time that J. Cal and Freebird were having a major feud.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.120]   And it looked like the pod was maybe about to break up.
[01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.920]   So I mean, for real breakup number one.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.920]   Yeah, this is breakup number one.
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.360]   We're maybe breaking more two or three.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:44.760]   I don't know.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.080]   But you guys are definitely feuding.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.280]   So we're walking down the street.
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.520]   And all of a sudden, somebody stops us.
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.920]   And he this is like a fan from I don't know, like.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.880]   Are you from the Australia?
[01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:58.360]   Australia.
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.720]   He was he was Australian.
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:00.520]   He was from Australia.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.160]   You remember this?
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:01.720]   He's Australian.
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:03.640]   He was from Australia visiting Milan.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.120]   Hi, Mike.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:04.760]   Are you Chamath?
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:07.800]   And he stops us in the street and takes a photo and the whole thing.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.480]   And as we're walking away,
[01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   Chamath says, you better make this thing work because I like being famous.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.120]   You can't go back to being not famous.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.760]   You guys better not screw this up because I like being famous.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.800]   It's a delicate balance.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.960]   Fame or being right.
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:26.760]   Who knows?
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.720]   Hey, for people who didn't get the joke last week, I love Freebird.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:32.600]   I'm trying to develop a deep, meaningful relationship with Freebird.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.080]   I love Freebird.
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:33.880]   What do we think of Vivek?
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.120]   Let's get back to the brass tacks here.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:37.480]   RFK versus Vivek.
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.120]   We've now had two of the top five candidates and Chris Christie has agreed to come on the
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:43.160]   mooch put me in touch.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.360]   I have to be honest with you.
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.760]   RFK and he are more similar than they are different on a lot of topics.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:54.600]   You know, the contours, I think, are different on a few very specific ones, obviously.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:42:00.920]   But it's like these outsider candidates, I think, have like a they're just a they're
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.280]   a breath of fresh air because I think and Vivek said it right.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.240]   The he and RFK, they have nothing to lose.
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:09.080]   So they just tell you what they think.
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:12.440]   They don't have to memorize anything because what they think is what they think.
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:15.480]   And so you just consistently get this stream of consciousness.
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:19.800]   And the more and more I hear from these kinds of candidates, the more and more they make
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.800]   sense and juxtaposed against the establishment candidates.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.920]   It's very stark.
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:31.000]   Would you consider Trump, Saks, you know, as being the sort of precursor to these two
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.120]   non traditional candidates?
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:38.360]   So now we have three non traditional candidates in the mix, Trump, Vivek, and RFK, and they
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:39.800]   all are shoot from the hip.
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:45.560]   Here's what I honestly think, and maybe more moderate and pragmatic in terms of their positions.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:46.120]   Well, sure.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:51.800]   I mean, Trump ran for office for president without having ever run for office before.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:55.240]   And so yeah, as a democrat, he's a democrat who ran as a republican too.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:43:00.280]   I mean, and he moved the Republican Party in a bunch of ways that were totally new.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.480]   Trump's lasting impact, I think, is going to be on the Republican Party.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:10.360]   I mean, he moved the Republican Party from an open borders, completely free trade, sort
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:17.880]   of party, warmongering, knee jerk militarism, neocon to being anti war, wanting to have
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:23.240]   strong borders, being at least skeptical of trade, at least with China, if not other countries.
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:25.400]   And I think he hasn't wanted to mess with entitlements.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:30.360]   He understands that's the third rail, and very much against like the Paul Ryan wanting to
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.840]   touch those at least in a non bipartisan way.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:39.800]   I think that for the republicans to take on those issues by themselves, I think he understands
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.360]   as suicidal.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.000]   You lose votes when you start taking on entitlements.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.920]   And I think that what Trump also did, which is really interesting, is that it cascaded
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:51.880]   a wave of self reflection in a lot of other Western countries.
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:57.000]   So Italy's more right, as a result, the UK went right, Spain looks like it's about to
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.640]   tip right, the Dutch actually just lost their election because of national border issues,
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.200]   or, you know, they dissolve their government.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:10.680]   So there's like a real clear nationalism, would you say?
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.880]   It's more of the nationalist inflection as the globalist.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.720]   I mean, that's right.
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.240]   The Overton window, I think, changed quite a bit with Trump in the mix, because now you
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:23.880]   actually had this much more America first nationalist orientation as the alternative
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.520]   to this sort of globalist, whether it's neoliberalism or neoconservatism.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:34.440]   Those two things have more in common with each other than they do with this more nationalist,
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.400]   populist approach.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.460]   Right.
[01:44:36.460 --> 01:44:38.200]   Freebird, what did you think?
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.160]   What was your take?
[01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:44.440]   I mean, RFK obviously concerns you a bit, because of the I don't want to use the conspiracy
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:51.080]   word, but let's just call it maybe, you know, he's open minded to he's open minded to different
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:51.560]   theories.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.840]   So where do you stand on RFK in relation to Vivek today?
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.360]   Freebird?
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:45:01.880]   Obviously, I think he's crafted his narrative in a way that can be broadly appealing.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.320]   And as I mentioned, in our text stream, I think also appeals to the Trump base.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.240]   In a way, it's a very smart campaign.
[01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:18.360]   I think that the strategy, the positioning, everything feels like it's hitting the mood
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.000]   of the moment.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:27.400]   And, you know, I would argue like, you could probably call any election cycle, any campaign,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.600]   one of two things, it's a promise of what can I do for you?
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:34.760]   Or how can I go and destroy the system that did bad for you?
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:43.400]   And Trump, RFK, and by the way, the higher the magnitude of that statement, the more
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:47.880]   appealing the candidate is, I think Vivek is doing a great job hitting a reasonably
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.840]   high magnitude on the, you know, the system has failed us, we need to go and fix these
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:53.880]   problems kind of moment.
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:46:01.800]   And it's really good, but I think it's really good for call it the audience that's engaged
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:03.720]   in the intellectual debate around it.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.440]   Not necessarily for Vivek.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.640]   At this point, I need to spend a little more time with the Santa's to be honest, and understand
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.440]   where he sits.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:15.640]   I obviously have deep concerns about Biden.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:22.520]   What would your concerns on Biden be his cognitive issues or the out of control spending?
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:24.040]   I don't think he's running the country.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:29.160]   And I think that those who are there's absolutely no accountability and discipline and what's
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:33.480]   going on with respect to spending, as I mentioned, Vivek did not appeal to me in resolving that
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.600]   concern either, by the way, he thinks we're going to grow our way out of it, which is
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.440]   part of the premise of modern monetary theory, which I think is a flunk.
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.200]   So you still don't have a candidate in terms of controlling spending?
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:49.560]   Yeah, look, I think the problem with Vivek is he's not going to be appealing to the masses,
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:52.440]   because he's so smart and so articulate.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.160]   That it doesn't have the Trump basics.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:02.680]   The Trump basics are insult the bad guy, call yourself the best thing in the world, make
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.160]   jokes, and people might be over that.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.520]   I think people might be over it.
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:07.000]   I don't know.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.920]   It could be the exact are people over it.
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:15.240]   The bullying, the name calling the bombastic Trump nature, do you think people are over
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:15.480]   it?
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.560]   You think that's going to burn people out this election cycle?
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.680]   Well, not if you look at the polls.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:24.600]   They're not on the Republican Party, I think in the general they might I mean, look, I
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.320]   think right now it looks like we're on track to have a Biden Trump rematch.
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.760]   And right now, Biden probably looks like he's going to win barring a recession happening
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:42.280]   or the Ukrainian side collapsing in the war, which I mean, I mean, that indictment dropping
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.760]   sounds pretty, you know, like another bombshell.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.120]   So do you think there's any chance?
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:49.960]   Okay.
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.640]   So what's your favorite moment?
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.840]   You know, from this discussion was where there was there a standout moment for you, sax?
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.880]   We thought, sorry, I want to hear your question.
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.080]   Chamath, would you vote for him?
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.080]   Are you still in RFK camp?
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.760]   Are you kind of still open minded about everything?
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.600]   I wasn't sure what his campaign was about.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:14.920]   And and I come away pretty meaningfully intrigued about what he had to say.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:22.840]   I think that there are some fundamental issues that RFK has me on that I wanted Vivek to
[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:26.520]   own and he he flirted with them, but he didn't quite own them.
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:27.820]   Such as?
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:35.400]   I think that the just like the deconstruction of the military industrial complex was is so
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:37.080]   definitive in RFK.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:40.440]   And it was it was almost quite there with the back, but not quite there.
[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.200]   So I wish he would I wish he would own that.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:47.960]   I think that the deconstruction of the Department of Education, I need to think more about,
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:51.080]   but some of his ideas are frankly more compelling.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.040]   The pro life pro choice thing, I think is very complicated.
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.040]   And I think you can go to this place of saying, let the states choose.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:04.920]   But I I'm just not sure whether that's the right ultimate solution.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.920]   And, you know, proposing some federal legislation,
[01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:11.960]   or would you want to end up on that you would want to end up like Europe, like a certain
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:15.880]   number of weeks federally, and then maybe some local laws around abortion and right
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:16.520]   to choose.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:22.440]   I think that there is just like you, you have to fundamentally if you believe in personal
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:29.240]   freedom, I think having an arbitrary definition of what a person is, and then what that freedom
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.160]   means, to me is already the slippery slope.
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:34.840]   And so I have a real issue with that.
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:40.440]   But I also agree with him about the actual decay of American society, you know, the lack
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.880]   of religious institutions and the lack of family and purpose, those two things above
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.480]   all others, I think, are tearing this country apart.
[01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.920]   Because people substitute something for it was his point, right?
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.640]   It's leaving people incredibly empty.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.120]   And so I just think that you have to have some of these fundamental protections.
[01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:03.800]   sex, what were your favorite moments during this or moments where you think he stood out
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.720]   or he shine at moments where you maybe have some fundamental disagreement?
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.200]   Well, okay, there's a few issues.
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:15.080]   Let me respond to so in terms of the vague versus RFK, Jr.
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.040]   I think where Kennedy really shines is like Jamal said, when he talks about the military
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:27.720]   industrial complex, and I would say more generally, RFK has this critique about regulatory capture,
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:31.640]   which he describes as the marriage of state power and corporate greed.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:38.360]   And included in that is what's happened to the FDA and big pharma and the whole government's
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:45.800]   response on COVID. And then he wraps in censorship as being the way that this RFK thoughts are
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:49.720]   very marriage of corporate greed and state power, the way it defends itself that and
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.080]   that's unacceptable.
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:57.720]   So I think like on those issues, I don't think anybody speaks as deeply as RFK, Jr.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:02.920]   Now, when it comes to the list, if you were to like list out all the issues, and where
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.720]   Vivek is and where I am, it's a pretty close match.
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.280]   I mean, I'm not aligned with him completely on every issue, but I think it would be pretty
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:10.920]   close.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:13.640]   And I do really appreciate where he's coming from.
[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:19.160]   On Ukraine, he's not afraid to just come right out and say the truth, which is this is not
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:22.920]   an important enough American interest to be spending hundreds of billions a year on.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.440]   I wish we had more time.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.600]   What an amazing moment to actually delve into that.
[01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:30.920]   And particularly, I wanted him to explain what was happening in the party because there is
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:36.600]   a divide within the party between these like oxygen area and sort of more establishment
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.560]   Republicans like McConnell, like Scott, like Pence, the war machine, the war machine, and
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.680]   then people like him and Trump, and you put Trump in this category to are resisting that.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.080]   So I would have liked to hear more about that.
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:53.480]   What do you think of the moment where I kind of pinned him and I said, would you you wouldn't
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:56.440]   defend Ukraine, but you would defend Taiwan?
[01:51:56.440 --> 01:52:01.000]   And he said, Yes, for the next five years, I would defend Taiwan because of the semiconductor
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.400]   sharing that I've never heard a candidate say something that pragmatic.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.440]   Here's my interpretation.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:08.200]   I described it as cutthroat.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.240]   Well, it is pragmatic.
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.720]   What he's basically saying is that America right now is dependent on these chips, these
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:17.640]   very sophisticated high tech chips, I mean, conductor chips, and not just like the low
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.360]   end ones, the high end chips that are made in Taiwan, and that is a vital American interest.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:27.400]   And until we alleviate ourselves, or wean ourselves off that dependency, by making them
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:31.960]   ourselves, or securing some other supply, then we need Taiwan.
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:34.600]   And so therefore, we cannot allow it to fall into Chinese hands.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.800]   I'm saying a lot more than he did.
[01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:39.960]   But it's kind of an argument like saying, chips is the new oil.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:45.480]   And as long as this is a critical input into our economy, we have to secure our supply.
[01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:45.880]   I can understand that.
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:50.040]   The difference being Bush never said, we're going to the Middle East for oil.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.480]   He said, we're going there for democracy.
[01:52:51.480 --> 01:52:54.280]   So that's what I thought was like the very candid moment there, Sack.
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:59.800]   Yeah, but what always happens is that when America has a vital interest, you always
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:04.840]   cloak it in liberal rhetoric about rights and freedom and democracy and that kind of
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:05.160]   thing.
[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:05.880]   Democracy.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:10.040]   But what's frequently driving the decision is American interests underneath.
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.480]   He's being explicit about it.
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:17.480]   What he's basically saying is, as long as America's got this dependency, and we need
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:21.480]   Taiwan, we better defend it and protect it from falling into Chinese hands.
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:24.360]   But once we don't have that interest, then we don't.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.040]   I can understand that.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:26.840]   That was wild.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:28.200]   It was wild.
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.320]   I mean, refreshing for me.
[01:53:29.320 --> 01:53:31.080]   I thought actually was a highlight of the discussion.
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.520]   There's a couple other things he touched on.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.440]   So we talked about the other candidates.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:41.000]   I think he's being not disingenuous, but maybe a little bit unfair to DeSantis.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.360]   I think there's no question that DeSantis alone has been singled out by Trump and not
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.960]   just Trump, but Trump surrogates to be relentlessly bashed on.
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:52.040]   And this happens on social media.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.600]   It happens in speeches and talks, all this kind of stuff.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:56.360]   So they are going after DeSantis.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.640]   And that has an effect.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.080]   For a reason.
[01:53:59.080 --> 01:53:59.720]   He's number two.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.040]   Right.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:04.680]   And Trump clearly has pegged him as the biggest threat, and that's why they're targeting him.
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.080]   So that does have an impact.
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:12.680]   The advantage that someone like Vivek has in a way is that he doesn't have a record as
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:14.360]   an elected official.
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:17.080]   And so he can just go out there and speak freely on these issues.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:23.080]   And like I described on the show with him, he goes out there and inserts himself in the
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:26.440]   conversation when an issue is going viral.
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:27.400]   He jumps in.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:32.200]   And I think it's very important that he's doing it so quickly, because if you're a candidate
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.080]   and you wait till the next day, and then the news cycle moves on, you missed it.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:37.240]   Right.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.760]   So he's timing it perfectly.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.800]   So he hits the sweet spot.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:47.320]   There's only one way to do it, which is not to have surrogates, not to have a process.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.680]   Not to have a cabinet overthinking it.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:52.600]   Well, it's the same thing with our portfolio companies, right?
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.840]   They run it through all these PR people and a PR agency, and it gets reviewed.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:01.240]   By the time it goes through its 10th draft, it's too late.
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.520]   It doesn't go viral.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:05.320]   So he's running a social media campaign, and it's very effective.
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.920]   Now, I think that DeSantis is running a different kind of campaign.
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.680]   DeSantis actually has a record.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.160]   I think it's a fantastically successful record as being the most successful governor in the
[01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.520]   country, running the most successful state in the country.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:24.040]   So he's out there with this idea that, "Listen, let's make America Florida."
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:24.600]   Yes.
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.440]   So that's what he's campaigning on.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:32.280]   And so he is going out there with kind of a pre-determined agenda and a pre-determined
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:33.640]   stump speech, a playbook.
[01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.680]   And it's different than someone like Vivek, who's letting the issues come to him, and
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.080]   then he's responding as the issues come up.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.520]   In other words, Vivek is living off the land.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.160]   All of that is free media for him.
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.840]   It's earned media.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.200]   And Trump did the same thing in 2016, right?
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.560]   Every day, he would figure out, like, what are the issues today?
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:56.920]   And he'd go out and speak about them.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:02.760]   And you go all the way back to Pat Buchanan working for Richard Nixon back in, I think
[01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:06.600]   it was the '72 election, something like that, where every morning, Buchanan and there's
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.600]   a couple other speechwriters that open the newspaper and find an issue or two.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.520]   And they would go to Nixon and say, "Here's your talking points."
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:20.040]   And so they would find an issue that back in those days was going viral and have the
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.400]   candidates speak to it.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:22.520]   So they were nimble.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:24.120]   And I think that's what they were doing.
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:27.080]   And if you want to go viral in the social media era, that's what you have to do.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:30.920]   You have to lean into the issues that people are talking about that day.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:35.080]   And this is the thing is that I think Vivek knows how to do that.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.760]   Trump clearly knows how to do it.
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:38.280]   RFK knows how to do it.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.720]   RFK definitely knows how to do it.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.880]   RFK is going viral every day.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.560]   They're trending topic natives.
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:44.760]   And that's the difference.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:49.080]   Freeberg, did you have a highlight or a great moment or two from Vivek, things that made
[01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:53.720]   you go, "Huh, I really appreciate this person or candidate during the discussion"?
[01:56:53.720 --> 01:57:00.440]   What I appreciated was that we didn't see him, like, fall down on any topics.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:07.400]   And I think that his ability to go through the full discourse with us for however long
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.440]   we went, 90 minutes or something.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:09.160]   Hour 40.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:10.360]   Hour 40.
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:10.920]   Says a lot.
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.680]   You know, RFK Jr. did the same.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:18.440]   But again, it's a stark juxtaposition from what I have seen Biden do in terms of interview
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:18.920]   formats.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:21.320]   He has had his interviews are edited.
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:21.960]   They're short.
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:27.000]   And so to be able to have this breadth, but also have the data and be able to pull it
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.080]   from the top of his head and not have speaking notes.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.760]   We gave him no questions ahead of time.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.480]   There's no agenda.
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.040]   Of course not.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:38.120]   And I think it's great to see a candidate who can engage in that level of discourse,
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.760]   which was important and impressive for me.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.360]   I just hope it's broadly appealing.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.560]   And this, by the way, I just want to repeat something I've said many times in the past.
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:52.360]   There are two things I hate about politics, besides the relationship to a growing government.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:57.560]   The first is that people pick politics as a career.
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:58.920]   And I think that that's ridiculous.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:04.280]   I think people in a democracy should have a private life and then they should rotate
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:07.560]   into being civil servants and go and serve in public office.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.080]   It's not the founding fathers intended.
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:10.200]   That's right.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.240]   And so they were, you know, had they had their jobs and their businesses and everything,
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:15.560]   and they would rotate in and then they would rotate out of government.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.480]   The fact that people can be a politician for 30 years is ridiculous.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:23.400]   And I think it leads to all of the disincentives that have driven to a large government.
[01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.680]   What I appreciate about Vivek and RFK Jr.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:32.200]   is that they come at this from, and even Trump, they come at this from private life,
[01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:35.720]   and they take their turn in government and rotate out.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:39.640]   And that's why I did not get him to answer the question around what would he do besides
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.840]   being president if it didn't work out?
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.040]   What's he going to do next?
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.560]   The second thing I don't like about politics-
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:46.360]   By the way, just on that point, there's a lot of speculation about that
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.680]   within Republican circles.
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.840]   This is something I could, we just didn't have time to get into.
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:52.360]   Let me just finish it.
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.640]   Let me just finish and then we'll talk about it.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.720]   Sorry, yeah, let's come back to it.
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.720]   But the second thing is just money in politics.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:00.600]   And I hate that you can raise money and get votes.
[01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:05.960]   Just the general concept that you buy ad space and that you get people to change their vote,
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:07.320]   I think is the most-
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:08.360]   Oh, I love that.
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:10.680]   Yeah, I know you do, but I think it's so fucked up.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:15.640]   But what I like about what we just did is we actually had a conversation with the candidate
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.560]   and people can just listen to the conversation.
[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.400]   That's the old town square that Saks talks about that doesn't exist anymore,
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:25.080]   because everything is chopped up and then sold as media bytes on paid streams.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:29.000]   Whereas what we just did is a free conversation with a guy that anyone can tune in and listen to
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:29.880]   and learn about him.
[01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:34.120]   And that's what I found most compelling is we had a real conversation instead of watching
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.640]   a 30-second ad bite.
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:37.080]   What's the rumor, Saksipu?
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:38.280]   Yeah, so sorry, go ahead, Saks.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:42.360]   The knock on Vivek is that he's basically a Trump surrogate.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.840]   And I mean, Trump has said good things about him.
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:46.680]   Trump likes him to be out there, clearly.
[01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:48.280]   I mean, Trump has all but said that.
[01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:54.600]   So the idea is that Vivek is out there and initially he's doing this less now, but early on,
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:58.520]   he was just launching broadside after broadside on DeSantis.
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:01.800]   And so the idea is that he's out there as a Trump surrogate attacking the people Trump
[02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:07.240]   wants him to attack on the whole saying good things about Trump, and that he'll be rewarded
[02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.040]   for that somehow.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:09.800]   A cabinet position or vice president.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:14.360]   Cabinet position, people even now saying VP because he's doing so well, or maybe he gets
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:17.400]   an endorsement for a Senate run or something like that.
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:21.560]   So if we had more time, I would ask him about this like surrogate idea, but I'm sure he
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.920]   would have said no, but...
[02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:26.280]   That's why I asked him specifically, how much time have you spent with Trump?
[02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:27.720]   And when's the last time you talked to him?
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:28.520]   And he was honest about that.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:30.920]   I've only spent like I had dinner with him before I was even a candidate.
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.720]   So I'm wondering if there's some clandestine agreement with them through some back channel
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.760]   for him to do that, or if he's doing it on his own accord.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.800]   I think, well, clearly his answer would be no, I'm not a surrogate, I'm my own candidate.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:45.160]   And he probably is.
[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.400]   So my guess on it is that you can go out there and act like a surrogate,
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.080]   knowing that Trump's going to like it, and then you'll be rewarded.
[02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:58.120]   You don't need to have an explicit deal to understand that that would work out for you
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:00:58.840]   in that way.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.040]   Can I respond to Freeberg's point?
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:03.880]   So Freeberg, you said you don't like the money aspect of politics, and you don't like the
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:07.080]   sort of careerist aspect of politics.
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:13.160]   I think what we're seeing with candidates like Verve or RFK Jr. or Trump is candidates
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:14.760]   who are bucking those two trends.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.120]   I mean, clearly these are not lifelong politicians.
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:23.080]   They have maybe had a lifelong interest in politics, but they're not like lifelong office
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:25.480]   holders or candidates for office.
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.560]   And then on the money side, what they're all showing is something that we all know from
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:35.640]   our portfolio companies, which is that earned media is so much more valuable than paid media.
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:36.040]   Totally.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.760]   Paid media costs a fortune, and it doesn't really work.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.720]   No one really wants to look at advertising.
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.160]   They block it out.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.840]   So you spend a lot of money on advertising, and it never really gets you much compared
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.720]   to earned media, which is you figure out a way to insert yourself in the news cycle by
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:53.880]   appealing to people on issues that are being talked about.
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.120]   You figure out how to kind of hitch your wagon to, like you said, Jason, a trending topic.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:01.240]   And that's what all three of these candidates have done, and it works so well.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:06.840]   And I think that sort of the career politicians who are proceeding in this very kind of playbook
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:10.040]   way, which is we're going to go out, we're going to raise the most money from donors,
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.680]   that we're going to buy the most TV time, and we're going to be on message.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:17.480]   Meaning we're only going to talk about the things we want to talk about.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:21.320]   The problem is that doesn't work anymore because earned media is so much more valuable than
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.040]   paid media.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:25.560]   Well, look, I hope that's a trend, and I hope it flushes the money out of the system,
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:30.520]   and that candidates win based on the merit of the conversation that they have in earned media,
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.760]   instead of buying more ad space on paid media, and that it changes the game.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.520]   And I hope that the laws change too.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.440]   And I also hope that the laws change with respect to career politicians and term limits,
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.440]   and all that sort of stuff, because this whole career system and money in this thing is what's
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.320]   driving so much.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.720]   One of the contributors to inflation and government spending and government accountability and all
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:51.240]   the nonsense that goes on.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:52.920]   And I would love to see a change.
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.200]   I think the earned media is so valuable now that I think candidates who try to stay on their
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:02.040]   message on their agenda, it's going to cost too much money.
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.800]   It's basically an unsustainable path.
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.440]   I would urge all the Republican candidates, including to Santa's just to get out there.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.160]   By the way, this is a tremendously smart man.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.680]   I mean, he went to where is he?
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:13.160]   Harvard?
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:13.880]   Not on all in.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.080]   He's a lawyer.
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:15.720]   Where is he?
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:17.480]   Yeah, to be fair, I haven't asked him yet.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:18.440]   But why?
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.160]   Yeah, Chris Christie's coming.
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:24.040]   The last time I asked him to do something, we had technical difficulties.
[02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.800]   Remember that didn't go too well.
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:33.080]   Just for the record, the mooch who loves the fact that a unit of time has been named after him from
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:33.640]   USACs.
[02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:37.240]   Any 11 day period is known as a mooch.
[02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:38.600]   So if you have an 11 day,
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:39.400]   Scaramucci.
[02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.360]   A Scaramucci.
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:41.000]   It's a moochie.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:41.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.200]   Once you love that.
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:48.440]   But he he literally introduced me to Governor Chris Christie over text.
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.280]   So I'm in touch with Chris Christie's coming on the pod.
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:53.400]   So that's three of the top six or five in terms of polling.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.680]   I'll ask to Santa's to come on.
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.920]   We never get Biden because he'll fall asleep.
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.400]   I don't think Biden can do 45 minutes without a nap.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.320]   Don't insult the guy that might show up.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:02.360]   Let's see if we can get him.
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.560]   I think he may, you know, he may get Biden.
[02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.040]   I don't know.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:07.400]   Let's let's not I can't.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.240]   Yeah, I can ask.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.360]   I mean, let's try and get Biden.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:11.080]   I mean, it would be great.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:13.720]   We can get half an hour with him and he can have a real conversation with us.
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.160]   I'd be thrilled.
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.120]   The really interesting.
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:20.040]   Well, Biden just did freed Zakaria.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.400]   It was an interview that was pretty much localized to talking about foreign policy in Ukraine.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.440]   He and he also did that other woman on MSNBC.
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:29.640]   They're all canned.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.440]   He gets the questions.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:32.920]   And then they edit it for him.
[02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:34.200]   So he gets post production.
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.120]   Yeah, which, you know, then you could shape the thing however you want and shame on the
[02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:40.840]   media for doing that, honestly, to the left media.
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:45.640]   You're not helping the democracy here in the United States by, you know, putting the fix
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.440]   in for Biden.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.400]   If he can't do the interview, if he can't handle an hour, at least, then can he be the
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:51.960]   president?
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.080]   I mean, let's be honest here.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:56.440]   Well, they'll get the ratings just in terms of debrief.
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.880]   Was there anything we want to say about the whole banking crisis?
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:02.280]   I appreciate that he tried to find common ground with us.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.880]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.600]   I nearly made a joke that you are now going to do a fundraiser for him after that.
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:12.920]   No, I mean, listen, he said it himself, I'm going to respond to everything one out of
[02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:17.480]   100 times I may change my position based on new information, which by the way, we do here
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:17.960]   every week.
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.800]   Every week, we all listen to each other, we have vibrant debate.
[02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:23.720]   And sometimes we change our positions.
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:25.720]   You know, like, I think that's what any reasonable person does.
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:26.280]   Go ahead.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:30.280]   Yeah, I mean, look, I don't think we were that far apart from him on this whole banking
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:30.920]   crisis.
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:35.480]   I mean, I think we all agree that there should be no bailout for the shareholders and the
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:38.440]   bondholders of these banks that are poorly managed and go under.
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:46.520]   And I think that Vivek did endorse a proposal, which we I think Jason, you and I had both
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:53.560]   come up with, which was to have a higher level of FDIC insurance, no business banking, I
[02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:55.720]   think it was like 10 million or something like that.
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:58.360]   And you know, include that in the cost of the insurance.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:05:59.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:02.680]   It's just paid by the premiums of these banks for banking insurance.
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:06.600]   And Vivek had this point about, you know, if Roku is stupid enough to keep 500 million
[02:06:06.600 --> 02:06:09.800]   in a checking account, and the bank goes under, maybe they should lose it.
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:13.800]   It's like, okay, my goal is not to save Roku, if they're stupid enough to manage the money
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:15.880]   that needs to save the local school.
[02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:19.880]   Really, the only difference is that and I think free bird, you hit the nail on the head
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:25.880]   is when you have a bank run underway, you have to stop it before the panic can spread.
[02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:27.080]   Contagion is real.
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.520]   The contagion was absolutely real.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:32.200]   I don't think people outside Silicon Valley could understand that because they weren't
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:38.040]   in those Friday morning emergency phone calls and board meetings that were happening.
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:42.440]   So we know it was it had already moved so far beyond SVB.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:46.200]   At that point, we had founders moving their money out of First Republic and all these
[02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:46.760]   other banks.
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:47.880]   Thursday and Friday.
[02:06:47.880 --> 02:06:50.520]   On Thursday and Friday, and they wanted to go to the top four banks.
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.760]   And if it wasn't a SIB, it wasn't good enough.
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.960]   If it wasn't called Silicon Valley Bank, this would have been a totally different thing.
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.600]   And if it hadn't been us raising the alarm, let's be self aware people hate Silicon Valley
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:01.000]   tech.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.960]   There's this contingent of people who hate Silicon Valley tech and rich people.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.440]   And they were just gleeful.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:12.120]   You know, there's 20% of the sort of far left communist socialist, you know, idiots, who
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:17.080]   mids Elizabeth Warren's whoever's who are just like, oh, great, Silicon Valley is getting
[02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.120]   kicked in the nuts.
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.480]   They were thrilled to see it.
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:20.200]   Right?
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:21.800]   I was that was short and Freud.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:22.840]   All right, we got a wrap.
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.600]   Hey, pull up these pictures real quick.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.520]   This is your five second science corner.
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.360]   Look, these are photos taken on Mars yesterday.
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:29.240]   How cool is this?
[02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:30.120]   That's all I had to say.
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:35.720]   Those that's exactly the chances of taking a photo on Mars are 3 billion 721.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:36.200]   12.
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.040]   If you can see this looks just like this.
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:40.200]   So they're taken on those are from Uranus.
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:41.640]   Yeah, those are from Mars.
[02:07:41.640 --> 02:07:44.440]   Very similar to the photos I took on my anus last night.
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:50.680]   I took my iPhone 14 and I squatted down and took pictures of these dingleberries into
[02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:53.400]   a mirror and I said, what's going on down there?
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:57.240]   These these boulders are very similar to the dingleberries.
[02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:57.640]   What?
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:58.280]   What are these?
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:01.080]   It's my balls and it's my thing.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:07.640]   If you look at those similar to my huge balls, you guys can't put this out.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:11.560]   I love you guys.
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:13.800]   Don't you think that's cool that there's these cameras on Mars?
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:14.840]   It is incredible.
[02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:16.840]   Yes, I think it's incredible.
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:18.040]   And how cool are those photos?
[02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:21.480]   I feel like we should have two episodes this week since there were so many good topics for
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:22.360]   us to talk about.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:25.000]   But let's talk about the topics.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:25.960]   But yeah, that was good.
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.160]   A good meeting with love you guys.
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:28.600]   Love you guys.
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:34.840]   Hey, if you guys are around, you know, and you want to get a glass of wine and some pasta
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.840]   wine later, maybe next week or something.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:37.240]   Who knows?
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:38.600]   Maybe we all get together in person.
[02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:39.560]   Have a glass of wine.
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:40.760]   I see you soon.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:41.720]   I love you guys.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:43.560]   I love you.
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:44.040]   Besties.
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:49.400]   For the architect himself, the dictator, the Sultan of science.
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:54.760]   Obviously, after today's performance, I am still the world's greatest moderator.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.440]   This has been another episode of.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:00.040]   The All In Podcast, we're still together.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.880]   The band is still together producing hot tracks.
[02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:04.760]   We'll see you next week.
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:06.440]   I'll come at you two for Tuesday.
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.160]   Tears for fears.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.280]   Everybody wants to rule the world, including Vivek.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.600]   Next time, Chris Christie coming at you 100 Z-Boarding Zoo.
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:15.160]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:15.800]   Love you guys.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:16.200]   Bye-bye.
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.560]   Besties.
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.040]   We'll let your winners ride.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:22.920]   Rain Man David Saks.
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:29.960]   And it said we open sourced it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:30.600]   Love you, West.
[02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:32.920]   I'm the queen of Kinwam.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:34.920]   Let your winners ride.
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.920]   Let your winners ride.
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.840]   Let your winners ride.
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:39.880]   Besties are gone.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.560]   That's my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:44.760]   Win it all.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:47.240]   Oh, man.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:49.240]   My avatar will meet me at Blitz.
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:52.520]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.080]   useless.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.040]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:58.280]   Wet your feet.
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:09:59.160]   That beat.
[02:09:59.160 --> 02:10:00.120]   Wet your feet.
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:00.920]   Wet your feet.
[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:01.560]   Beat.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:02.520]   Wet your feet.
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:03.320]   We need to get merch.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.120]   Besties are back.
[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:05.640]   I'm doing All In.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:15.160]   I'm doing All In.
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:24.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
