[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the Gospel according to Saint John in the third chapter.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And reading from verse 9 to verse 13, from the ninth to the thirteenth verse in the third chapter of the Gospel according to Saint John.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   We continue, in other words, our study of this great third chapter of the Gospel according to John.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And we are doing so for some very good and very definite reasons.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The first is, and if we had no other, this is sufficient in and of itself.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We have the advantage in this particular chapter here, that as we are looking at it,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   of watching and observing our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ himself dealing with the soul.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Here the Lord himself acts as the evangelist.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And nothing is more important for us, surely, than to observe his method.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   This is the supreme method and example.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And here we watch him as he deals with this man Nicodemus, who came to him seeking that interview by night,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   as the result of having watched him performing his miracles while he was up in Jerusalem.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   There is no more important subject than this.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   How to help one another, how to evangelize, how to deal with the soul.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Then secondly, as I have been emphasizing on previous Sunday evenings,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   this subject is of importance because what our Lord is dealing with here is our eternal destiny.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And that is, do you see, what makes a service like this again this evening so different
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   from every kind of meeting that the world ever holds.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You and I, my friends, tonight are concerned not only about time but about eternity.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   That's why the faith is more important than history or music or art or any one of those things.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's not to detract from them, but it's to show the supreme importance of this.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Here we are looking at something that claims that it's going to decide and determine our eternal destiny.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And that is determined by this, as to whether we are or are not in the kingdom of God.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   That is the theme with which our Lord deals as here he speaks to this man Nicodemus.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And another good reason for coming back to it and for spending time with it like this is this.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   That is, you read the history of preaching and of the church.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You will find that this particular incident of our Lord's dealing with Nicodemus
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   has been used so frequently in bringing people into a knowledge of truth,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   in bringing men and women out of darkness into light,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   in leading people to see the way of salvation and enabling them to embrace it.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   God the Holy Spirit has used this passage, I say, so frequently that one likes to tarry with it
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and to spend a great deal of time in it, trusting that what he has done so often in ages past,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   he will still continue to do.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Now then, you remember that Nicodemus goes to our Lord and begins to speak, saying,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   "Master, it's obvious that thou art a teacher come from God,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And, but suddenly our Lord interrupts him and says,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And we've been realizing, as we've studied it,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   that our Lord did that and interrupted him in that way in order to shock him.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That was his method, you see, with this sort of men.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The previous chapter has told us that our Lord knows all men.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   We are told that he needed not that any should testify of men,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   for he knew what was in men, so that as Nicodemus came to him, he could read him as an open book.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   As we saw he'd done previously in the case of Nathaniel and Peter and all others,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   and he knew all about it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   He knew his mentality, he knew his outlook, and he knew therefore how to deal with him.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Here is a master in Israel.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Here is a man with a mind, a man of understanding, a man of culture,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   and a highly moral and religious man, and that's how our Lord deals with him.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   To shock him, why?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Because he's got to realize that his whole approach is wrong.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And we can never say this too frequently.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Most people are in trouble about Christianity because their approach is wrong.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They don't go wrong in details, it's their total approach that's wrong.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And because of that, of course, it's a waste of time to discuss details with them.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Nothing is more important than this approach.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Our Lord himself brings out their point.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   That's why he handles Nicodemus like this.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   He pulls him up, he stuns him as it were, and shocks him,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   in order to bring him to see that.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And so he goes on to tell him,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   "Nicodemus, if you really want to enter this kingdom,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   you've got to repent.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You must be born of water.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You've heard of the ministry of John the Baptist,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   and you know how people have been crowding to him to be baptized.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Did you go? Why didn't you go?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's essential. There must be repentance.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Whatever you are, whoever you are,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   you've got to confess and acknowledge your sins.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You've got to cast yourself helpless before God and leave yourself to it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   You must be born of water. You must repent.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   But not only that, you need a new understanding altogether.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   You must be born of water and of the Spirit.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   We spent our time last Sunday night in considering
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   what the biblical teaching is about this rebirth,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   this great mystery, marvel, miracle of regeneration,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   the operation of God upon the soul.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   How necessary it is we should know this.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So many think they can make themselves Christian,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   holding certain views, living a good life, not doing this, doing that.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   That makes you Christian.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   No, you must be born again.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You must be born of the Spirit.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   A mighty act by the Spirit of God must be worked down
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   in the very depths and vitals of the personality.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And a man must have a new outlook, a new mind, a new heart,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   a new will, a new everything.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   He must become a new creation.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Well, we've gone into that.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But still, you see, Nicodemus still doesn't understand.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And our Lord has put it so plainly to him.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   He's used that wonderful picture about the wind.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   "Look here," said our Lord to Nicodemus,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   "but don't waste your time in trying to understand in this way.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   What I'm talking about is something that is comparable
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   to the well-known phenomenon of the wind.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   The wind bloweth where it listeth.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So is every one that is born of the Spirit."
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   But all this Nicodemus still says,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   "How can these things be?"
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   He's baffled, he's bewildered, he's still trying to understand it all.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Well, our Lord therefore has to continue his instruction of him.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   He has to continue his discussion with him.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And now it's clear that our Lord feels
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   that he must become still more specific.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Because obviously Nicodemus is still not under conviction.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Nicodemus is still standing on his feet, erect as it were,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   and still putting himself against this person to whom he's speaking.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   He hasn't gone down, he certainly hasn't repented, he's not convicted.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   He hasn't become as a little child.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And our Lord says, "Except he be converted and become as little children,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom."
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But Nicodemus is still the full-grown man, standing erect,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   pitting his mind against the mind of this person to whom he's speaking.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So our Lord sees that it's essential to convict him still further.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And what we've got in this passage we're looking at this evening
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   are the further steps in the process of conviction.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And what applied to Nicodemus still applies today.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Am I addressing someone who has never seen the necessity of the new birth?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Am I speaking to someone who says with Nicodemus,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   "What is all this? How can these things be?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   What do you mean by the operation of the Holy Spirit?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   What do you mean by saying that I must be born again?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Surely that's asking me to commit intellectual suicide.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Surely that's asking me to become a fool.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Surely that's asking me to abandon and jettison my intellect
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and just give reign to my feelings and my passions and my emotions.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I can't see that. How can these things be?"
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Very well.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   If that is your position, I beg of you, I plead with you to listen
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   to what our Lord went on to say to this man, Nicodemus.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Let me say at once, he was a man who must of necessity draw out our admiration
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   in spite of his stumbling. He was a noble man in every sense of the word.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And as I say, a man of learning, a master of Israel
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   and a highly moral and religious person.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   That's why our Lord takes all this trouble with him.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   What does he say to him? What does he say to all such men?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Shall I summarize it by putting it in the form of three principles to you?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Here is the first.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The first essential, before we can even begin to see that kingdom of God,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   the first essential is a realization of our utter, our total inability.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Oh, I must repeat that because it's such a vital principle.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   There is no hope whatsoever of anybody ever becoming a Christian
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   unless and until he realizes his utter, his complete and total inability with these things.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Now listen to our Lord saying it.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Jesus answered and said unto him, verse 10, "Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   There are those who say it should be translated like this.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   "Art thou the master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   In other words, our Lord looked at him and said,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   "Luke Demerson, you're a very famous teacher.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You are acknowledged and recognized as the master of Israel, the master,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   outstanding teacher, whose name is on the lips of all,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and to whom people crowd to listen and to hear the instruction, the master of Israel."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   "Art thou the master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And yet isn't it not perfectly plain and clear that he did not understand
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and admits it by asking his question, "How can these things be?"
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Here is a man being instructed by the Son of God.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   He puts the truth plainly to him.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   He puts it in picture and parable, and still the master doesn't see it.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   What's the matter with him?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Well, there's only one thing to say about him.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He's blind.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   He's spiritually blind.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   He's spiritually incapable.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   He has no spiritual understanding, no spiritual insight.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And now, my friends, this is what the Bible says of all of us by nature.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   The whole case which is put by the New Testament gospel is just this,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   that we are all born into this world spiritually blind.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   We are not all men who have the vision and the faculty divine.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   No, no.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   We are born in darkness.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   "The natural man understandeth, receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he, because they are spiritually discerned."
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   The apostle Paul, again in writing to the Corinthians in that first epistle, says,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   "Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   not many mighty, not many noble are called."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   It was the truth.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It was the fact.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Why?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Well, because they lack a spiritual understanding.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Mankind, the whole of mankind by nature, is blind.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And look at it exemplified in this man above all men,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   this outstanding teacher of Israel, this expert in the Old Testament literature,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   this man whose whole business was to instruct people in a knowledge of God and a worship of God.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   When the great central truth is put before him, he doesn't see it.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   He stumbles, he's baffled, and he asks his questions.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   That was his trouble.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He was spiritually blind.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He lacked a spiritual understanding.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   He doesn't see that his whole position is wrong.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   He doesn't realize that his whole nature is wrong.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   The first thing that a man's got to realize, he cannot see.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   He can't get at it.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   He's somehow blinded against this, and he's offended by it,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   and he keeps on putting his questions.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   There is only one explanation of this.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   It is, I say, a condition and a state of spiritual blindness and spiritual impotence,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   a complete lack of understanding.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Now that is the whole tragedy of the world, that men may be very able and very gifted.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   They may understand many, many matters, but when you come to this, it's a closed book for them.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   They see the letter but miss the spirit.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   They read the words, they don't get the meaning.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   And you put it plainly to them, and they stand back with Nicodemus, and they say,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   "How can these things be?"
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Now then, our Lord now goes on to particularize still more and puts it like this.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Did you notice this extraordinary statement?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   "If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   how shall, how can you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?"
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   What's he mean by this?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Well, here you see he is carrying on the argument, and he's advancing.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   What he meant was this.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Nicodemus, you still don't see why this new birth is a not our absolute necessity.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Let me show you why it is.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I've put earthly things to you, and you can't see them, you can't believe them, you can't receive them.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   What are you going to be like if I put heavenly things to you?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   What does he mean?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   What are these earthly things about which he's speaking?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Well, obviously, he is referring to the things that he has already been saying to Nicodemus.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "If I have told you earthly things," what are they?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Well, all his teaching about the rebirth, about regeneration, about being born again,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   about being born of water and of the Spirit.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Well, is that something earthly, says someone?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Well, according to our Lord, it is.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   How do you explain it?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Well, let me explain it in this way.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   All that our Lord has been saying so far to Nicodemus, while it is spiritual truth,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   is in a sense earthly truth in this way.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   That he was there talking about something that, after all, happens on earth.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Something that can be seen happening in the lives of men and women.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Earthly things, let me put it in this form.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Nicodemus should not have stumbled at this teaching.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   As a master of Israel and as one who was familiar with the Old Testament literature,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   he should have known something about this.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   He was a man who had often read the 51st Psalm,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   and he had often taught it and expounded it to others,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   and yet he'd obviously never understood it.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Because what David cries out for in the 51st Psalm is this,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me."
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   David, the king of Israel, the sweet psalmist of Israel, that's what he wants.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Why did he need it?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Well, he'd fallen into that terrible sin.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   He first was an adulterer and then a murderer on top of it.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And at last he awakens to the fact that he's unclean within,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   and that he can't put himself right.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "Wash me with hyssop, cleanse me," he says.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   "Create within me a clean heart.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Give me," he says, "a new spirit."
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   "Thou," he says to God in his prayer, in his agony of prayer,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   "thou desirest truth in the inward parts."
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   David had seen it.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   You know the doctrine of the rebirth is not a New Testament doctrine only.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's there in the Old Testament.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It belongs to what you've already got, says our Lord to Nicodemus.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And you are without any excuse whatsoever.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I've been talking earthly things to you.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   But not only is it there in the 51st Psalm, let me give you one other example of it.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's there in a very great and glorious passage in the 36th chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   where God, addressing the nation, said,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   "You're in trouble, you're in the captivity of Babylon, you're in a mess, you're in a horrible position.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   What can be done about you?"
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   "Well," he says, "you can do nothing, but I'm going to do it.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And what I'm going to do for you is this.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I'm going to take out of you that heart of stone, and I'm going to give you a heart of flesh."
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   What a marvelous statement of this doctrine of the rebirth.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And not only that, he says, "I'm going to put my spirit within you.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I'm going to give you a new spirit, my own spirit I'm going to put within you, in your inward parts."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   That's the doctrine of the rebirth. It's there in the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   And of course this master of Israel, this great teacher, was so familiar with it,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   and he'd often taught it, and yet when our Lord puts it to him, he says, "How can these things be?"
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   "Nicodemus," says our Lord, "I've met you on your own level.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I've met you on the very things that you know all about.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I've talked to you about things on which you're an expert.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   You don't understand them.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Well, in the name of God, what are you going to do when I tell you about the heavenly things?"
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Earthly things. Earthly in that sense, but not only in that sense.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   These can be described as earthly things in another sense, in this way.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   This whole matter of the new birth is something, surely, with which we are all as human beings familiar,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   as a result of reading books and as the result of reading biographies.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I mean by that that if you're not a Christian, you've come across this.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   You see, it can be described therefore as earthly.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   You may not be a Christian tonight, but I'm quite sure that you've heard about Saul of Tarsus,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   who became the Apostle Paul.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   You've read of how that man at one time was a hater and a persecutor of the Christian church.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   But then you know him as the Apostle Paul, the great preacher, evangelist,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   the writer of these magnificent epistles.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   What happened to him? Well, you see, it's obvious.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   He underwent some tremendous change.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   His whole life was revolutionized.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   He seems to have been regenerated.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He's become a different and a new man.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Well, you're familiar with that. It's an earthly thing.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Not only that, you've heard of the great Saint Augustine.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And you've known how at one time, though he was a brilliant philosopher,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   he lived that voluptuous, sinful, immoral life.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And then, how later he became this great doctor in the church,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   with his mighty teaching that has come down and persisted even till today.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   What was it? You know the story.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   There he is sitting in the agony of his mind and his heart in the garden,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   trying to find peace, fighting against this conviction,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and yet the lust and the desire, not able to resolve it.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And there he suddenly hears a voice coming and saying, "Rise and read."
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   A little child was saying it.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And he got up and he went and he opened the Bible at the 13th chapter of the epistle to the Romans,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and the tremendous passage, "Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   the night is far spent, the day is at end."
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   And in a flash, his eyes were opened,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   and the immoral philosopher became the holy saint in the church of God.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You all know about that. That's a part of secular history by tonight.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   It's common knowledge. Everybody knows that there is this phenomenon.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   It's an earthly thing. Our Lord has been teaching him earthly things.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Well, I could go on multiplying my examples and illustrations.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Let me leave it at that, but let me put it thirdly like this.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I imagine that there is no one in this congregation
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   who has not at some time or another met actually in life and in experience a person
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   to whom this sort of thing has happened.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You've known people or have heard of them at innerit, first hand probably,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   who once were the hopeless victims of sin,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   and who had done everything they could, and whose families had done all they could but of no avail.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And then you heard that everything was different. The man had become a new man.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   It's happened to men and women within your knowledge, within your experience. You've met it.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Well, I say this is something earthly. This is something at innerit, which seems to be on our level.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Let me put it very generally like this.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   That this phenomenon of conversion is a fact which is familiar to people who are not Christian.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   The psychologists write their books about it. They're interested in it as a phenomenon to examine.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You see, it's a fact of history that some of the great things in the world have been the result
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   of this tremendous climactic change that have taken place in people's experiences.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   So it's a part of philosophy. It's a part of psychology, as it were.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And men who are not Christians are interested in it. It's an earthly something.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   But this man stumbles at it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Though it seems to be a matter of common knowledge that when you come to talk about religion,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   you are entering into a realm which is different from all others,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   but put like this, they can't see it. They stumble at it.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And isn't it a fact, mustn't every man grant here tonight,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   that there is something essentially different about religion?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   We know, don't we, if we take up science or art or music or whatever it may be we're interested in,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   well, we apply our minds and all we have to do is to apply our minds and give a certain amount of diligence
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and we can become masters.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   But everybody knows that it isn't like that in the religious life.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Everybody knows that. You've heard of people going off into monasteries
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   or becoming hermits and anchorites and so on.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And you say, well, of course, that religious life is so different.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   You start by realizing that it belongs to a different kind of category of knowledge and of experience.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   It's common knowledge. It's earthly.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   And yet though it is earthly, Nicodemus stumbled at it.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   And there are so many who are still stumbling at it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   They're still trying to enter into the kingdom of God
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   exactly as if they were entering into a secular occupation
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   or as if they were trying to enter into a club or into some ethical society.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   They know, they should know, it's common knowledge that it's altogether different
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   and yet they still try to do the other.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   If you don't understand the earthly,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   what hope is there when you come to consider and to face the heavenly?
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Well, what's this? What does he mean by the heavenly?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   If I have told you earthly things and you believe not,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   What are the heavenly things? He goes on to tell him.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I just want to take hold of the principle this evening.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   If you and I fail, I say, along the level that we've already been considering,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   well then what conceivable hope have we in the realm of heavenly things?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   What are these?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Now let me remind you before I describe them that our Lord in saying this and in doing this
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   has still got one object in his mind.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   He is still trying to bring this man Nicodemus to see
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   that to be born again is an absolute necessity.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   By putting it on that level, the earthly level, he can't see it very well, he says.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   If you can't see it there, now then listen to this.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   If you couldn't see it at that level, now then face this level.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I'm going to tell you something now about the heavenly things.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   And what are these heavenly things?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Well, here is the first.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   God himself.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   God.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You know religion is not primarily a matter of conduct and behavior and morality.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   It is a knowledge of God.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Theology means the knowledge of God.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And the whole purpose of religion is to bring men to God.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Very well, says our Lord to Nicodemus, I'm now beginning to tell you about the heavenly things.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And of course heaven primarily means God.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   The character of God.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   The attributes of God.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   God is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   God is eternal.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   God is omnipotent.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   God is omniscient.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   God is omnipresent.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   God is without beginning or end.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   God is light and in him is no darkness at all.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   He sees the end from the beginning.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   All things are under his hands and in him we live and move and have our being.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   God.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   What do you know about God?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   We are no longer talking about the phenomenon of conversion.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   We are talking about God.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And as this gospel has already put it in that introduction in the prologue in the first chapter,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   "No man hath seen God at any time."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Are you still standing erect upon your feet?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Are you still coming to Christianity with your own understanding and your own ability and your own logic?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Are you pitting your mind? My friend, we are talking about God.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   And we are talking about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   If you like, we are talking about the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Three persons, but one God.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Of the same essence, but three personalities.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   The three in one.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   The eternal blessed three in one.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Is your understanding spanning it and grasping it with ease?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Can you approach this as you approach that secular subject in which you are expert?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Or that business in which you so excel?
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Are you still trying to?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   That's what we are talking about.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And then, God's view of sin.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   God's view of man.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   That's what it's about.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That's what the Bible is about.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It's a revelation of that.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   It isn't man who has arrived at it, it's God revealing it.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Now I say, these are the things that we are discussing.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   God's view of man and God's view of sin.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   And then we are concerned about God's terms of salvation.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   What does God think about a man in sin?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Now I know you say, I don't think it will be fair that God should judge a man and then send him to eternal perdition.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I don't, now my friend, we're not, really I'm sorry, I'm not wanting to be rude.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   But I'm not here just to discuss what you think, nor what I think.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   You know no more than I do.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   And I don't know any more than you do.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   We're not concerned in our own personal opinions.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   We are talking about God and His opinion.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   What do you know about God's opinion?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   That's the question.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   What is God's view of men in sin?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   What is God going to do about men in sin?
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   What do you know about it, I'm asking?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   What are men's eternal destiny?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   What do you know about it?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   You're living in this world, you're in this chapel now, you won't be here in a hundred years' time,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   you'll have died, you'll be on in eternity.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   What's going to happen to you?
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   What do you know about it?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   These are the heavenly questions.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Ah, you may know about conversion in this life, but what happened to Augustine after he died?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   What happened to Paul?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   That's the question.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   What do you know about it?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   These are heavenly things.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   We are beyond the veil.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And then God's way of dealing with men in sin and in His lost estate.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Do you know anything about it?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   If so, where did you derive your knowledge?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   On what authority can you say, "What I believe is this, that because God is love."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And how do you know that God is love?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Because God is love, He's just going to forgive everybody, everything will be alright at the end.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   How do you know?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Where did you get your information from?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   What's your sanction?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   What's your authority for what you're saying?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Those are the questions.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   These are the heavenly things.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   How can a man be just with God?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   How can I be forgiven?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   How can I arrive at God and Heaven?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Those are the questions.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   They're every one of them.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Heavenly things, heavenly questions.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I ask my question once more.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   What do you know about these things?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   How can you know about these things?
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Tell me.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Have you ever ascended into Heaven?
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Have you ever seen God?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   What do you really know about God?
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Do all your secular subjects help you to know God?
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Ah, so and so says this, yes, it's only his theory, he doesn't know any more than you do.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   He says he thinks that God must be like this, therefore he's bigger than God himself.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   His God is smaller than he is.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   That's why he can put him on paper and say this and that.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   The great philosopher who can put God in a book or on a table.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Monstrous.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   It's pure figment of imagination.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   He doesn't know God, he's never seen Him.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   No man ever has.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Do you by now, my dear friend, realize the futility, the utter futility,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   of trusting yourself or your own understanding or your own ability?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Don't you now see that a man must be born again?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Can't you see that face to face with these subjects,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   there's only one appropriate attitude for man,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and that is on his knees, in utter confession of failure,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   that he's baffled, that he's ignorant.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   He is indeed a little child, he knows nothing.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   The master of Israel knows no more than the biggest ignoramus in the land.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Isn't it right, can't you see it?
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   If you couldn't see it on the earthly level, don't you see it now on the heavenly level?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   How can a man know about these things?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   What's the use of going on asking how can these things be?
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   You and I and all mankind is not in a position to ask any questions.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   As we listen to this, we have but one thing to do,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   to put our hands upon our mouths and stop and listen.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And that is precisely what our Lord invited Nicodemus to do.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Listen.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and testify that which we have seen, and ye receive not our witness.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Our Lord, of course, is here speaking about himself.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   So that my second principle is this, you see,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   that having seen our complete, utter inability and impotence,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   we are now to listen to him.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   We are to stop questioning and interrupting.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   We are just to stay and listen to him and hear what he's got to say.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And he's speaking.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Now we come here to what I would call the very nerve and center
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   of the Christian gospel and the Christian faith.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   You see, it's all a matter of authority.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   You and I, as we've seen, know nothing about these things.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Now, I trust nobody's arguing about that.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   What do you know, I ask, and you know nothing.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Very well, then, if we know nothing, what we need is an authority.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And we are confronted by one who says, "Listen to me, I am the authority."
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   The Christian message, the Christian gospel, is entirely about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   And what does it say about him?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Well, he tells Nicodemus the essential truth himself here in this eleventh verse,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   in this third chapter of the gospel, according to St. John.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Listen to him.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   "We speak that we do know."
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Who is this?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Why should I listen to him?
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Well, that's what he says.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   "I speak that which I know."
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Now, that was always his way of speaking.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   He doesn't say, "I've come to the conclusion."
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   He doesn't say, "This is my theory, this is my idea,
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   having spent a lifetime in a philosophical attempt to know God,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I have come to this tentative conclusion."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   He doesn't say, "Now perchance, perhaps, what if?"
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Neither does he say, "I am addressing you as the result of what I've been taught
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   in the school and the college that has produced me."
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   He never was in such a place.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   He wasn't a Pharisee, he was a carpenter.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   And he doesn't quote his authorities and say, "Hillel said this, Gamaliel thought that,"
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   and so go on quoting authorities, as the Pharisees and scribes, Nicodemus included,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   always did in their teaching.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Now, now, he just stands up and says,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, but I say unto you,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   we speak that which we do know."
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Not a hesitation, but an absolute authority,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   speaking with a certainty and an absoluteness,
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   which led a soldier sent to arrest him to say this,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   "Never men speak like this man.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   We know."
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Very well, are you not prepared to listen?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Here is someone who says, "He knows.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   You and I have been looking at the heavenly things and we say we know nothing.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   We are ignorant here," says one.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   A man like ourselves, he comes to us and says, "We know."
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   But then he says something still more amazing.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "We speak that we do know and testify that which we have seen."
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Seen?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   What is he talking about?
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Well, he is talking about the heavenly things that he is mentioning.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So what he is saying, you see, is this, that he has seen God.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   He is talking about God and he says, "It is not hearsay.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   It is not theory.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   It is not second-hand information.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   I am speaking what I have seen."
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   The only begotten which is in the bosom of the Father,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   he hath declared him, he has spoken about him,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   he has set him forth, he has led him forth,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   he has manifested him."
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   How? Well, he has seen him.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   We want to know about God and we want to know about the mind of God,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   what God thinks of men, what God thinks of sin, God's way of salvation.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Is there anybody who has ever seen into the mind of God?
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   That is what I want.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   And here is one who says he has seen into the mind of God.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   He has been with God.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   He has spoken to God.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   He comes with first-hand information, not theory.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   He knows, he sees, and so he testifies, which means that he witnesses.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   He says at the end of his life, "To this end was I born,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and for this cause came I into the world,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   that I should bear witness unto the truth."
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   He has seen it, he knows it, he is bearing witness unto it.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   He is testifying with respect to it.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Who is this?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Are we to listen to him?
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   "He is the ravings of a madman,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   for he is a man, the carpenter of Nazareth."
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   And yet this is what he says.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   We know, we have seen, we testify.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Who is he? How can he do it?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   How can a man ever know these heavenly things?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Has anybody ever ascended up unto heaven?
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   We will listen to him.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   "And no man hath ascended up to heaven,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   but he that came down from heaven,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   even the Son of Man which is in heaven."
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   How does he know?
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   What has he seen? How has he had the vision?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Where does he derive his understanding?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   And he tells Nicodemus plainly and simply,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   "Here is one who has come down from heaven."
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Here is not just a man who is looking up in the direction of heaven
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and almost giving up in despair.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   He says, "I have come down from heaven."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   The great doctrine of the incarnation.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Here is something that does not belong to earth.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Here is something that the psychologists and the philosophers
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   do not understand at all.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   This is a heavenly thing.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And this is what it says,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   that God, the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity,
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   came out of heaven,
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   divested himself of the insignia of the everlasting glory,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and entered into the womb of the Virgin Mary
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   and was born as a babe in Bethlehem and put in a manger.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   That is the heavenly business.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   He has come down from heaven.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   He was with the Father, in the bosom of the Father.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And the Word was God in the bosom of the Father,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   speaking to God, sharing his secrets,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   seeing him, loving him, enjoying him.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   But he has come down to earth.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   He is God as well as men.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   God-men, the Son of men,
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   a new man, a new humanity,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   the beginner of a new race.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   He is not one amongst men who has reached a little further
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   in his religious quest and in his philosophic endeavor.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   No, no, there has never been anybody like him.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   He is the Son of man, stands alone in a category apart,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   the firstborn of many brethren, God in the flesh,
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   incarnation, the coming of the eternal Son
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   into the world and into time
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   That is what he says to Nicodemus.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And that is the message of the Gospel this evening.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   You and I need to know God and know how to be reconciled to him
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   and how to be blessed by him.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   And, my dear friend, there is only one who can give you any light at all
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   on these great and vital and eternal questions.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   It is the Son of God himself.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   That is Christianity.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And that is the uniqueness of Christianity.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Every other religion is man's attempt to find and to discover God.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Here God himself has sent out his own Son
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   into the world in the form of a man
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   in order to give us the light
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   and in order to rescue and to redeem us.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   And there is only one thing to do.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   It is to do the opposite of what he tells Nicodemus
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   that he, Nicodemus, had been doing.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   we speak that we do know
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and testify that we have seen,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and ye receive not our witness."
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Can anybody be foolish enough
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   to go on rejecting this witness still?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   If you do reject it,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   you are left in your ignorance,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   you are left as a man,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   you are left in your impotence.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   You can try to understand from now until you are dead
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   and you will know no more than you know at this moment.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Philosophy throughout the centuries has been trying,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   but the world by wisdom knew not God,
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   and it never will.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   It had tried in its greatest men before Christ ever came.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   And you will never know,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   you will never understand.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   There is only one thing to do.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   It is to realize your total inability.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   It is to look into the face of this person who says,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   "I have come down from heaven,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   from the Father whom I know and whose Son I am.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I have come to tell you."
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   There is only one thing to do, I say,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and that is to believe him,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   to believe his message,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   to surrender our lives to him,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   and to ask him to deal with us,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   to save us,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   and to reconcile us,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   and to introduce us to God.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   No man hath ascended into heaven,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   no man ever will.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   But the Son of God became the Son of men,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   that sons of men might become the sons of God.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   He came into the midst of our grief
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and shame and loss
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   in order to do for us
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   what none other could do.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   God so loved the world
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   but have everlasting life.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Look at him.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   I pray you, I beseech you,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   look at him, look at this man, as it were,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   who stands before you and says,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   "I speak that which I know.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   I testify to that which I have seen.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   I have come down from heaven."
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Very well, get down on your knees before him.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   Look up at him and say,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   "My Lord and my God,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   take me, save me,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   give me the blessed knowledge
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   of God and his salvation."
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   And if you do so, he will not refuse you.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   He will receive you,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   and you will know God
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   and become a child of God.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   And you will go through life
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   and through death triumphantly,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   and then go on to be with God
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   for all eternity.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   Amen.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   We do hope that you've been helped
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   All of the sermons contained
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   within the MLJ Trust Audio Library
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   are now available for free download.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   You may share the sermons or broadcast them.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   However, because of international copyright,
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   please be advised that we are asking,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   first, that these sermons never be offered
