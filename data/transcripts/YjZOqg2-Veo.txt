[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   I should like to call your attention this evening to verses 16 and 17 in the 11th chapter
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.960]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.200]   Two of the verses that we read in the reading just now.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.840]   Verses 16 and 17 in the 11th chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:35.440]   For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.840]   the branches.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.000]   And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild olive tree wert grafted
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.080]   in among them, and with them partakest of the root, and fatness of the olive tree, we
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.520]   must go on to complete, boast not against the branches; but if thou boast, thou bearest
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.840]   not the root, but the root thee.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.640]   But as I say, I'm anxious tonight to consider in particular verses 16 and 17.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:19.520]   Now here, most of you I'm sure will recall, we are commencing the consideration of a subsection
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.320]   in the section which runs from verse 11 to verse 32.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.280]   You remember we've divided up the whole chapter into three main divisions.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.880]   The first division was from verse 1 to verse 10.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.400]   The second division is from verse 11 to verse 32, and then the final section or division,
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.120]   verse 33 to the end of the chapter, which is that great doxology at the end of the tremendous
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.880]   argument that the Apostle has been working out.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   Now it's very important, obviously, that when we come to any particular subsection
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.720]   of a division, that we should be clear in our minds as to what the division is about.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.520]   So I would remind you it's essential that we should do so in interpreting these two
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.320]   verses which some commentators don't hesitate to describe as the two most difficult verses
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   in the whole of the Bible, and that is why this instrument is probably not working tonight,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.440]   because the devil is anxious that we shouldn't interpret it properly.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.560]   Some I say regard it as extremely difficult.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.640]   Well therefore, it is more than ever important that we should bear in mind the whole context.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.720]   Now the first division, you remember, verses 1 to 10, are concerned with establishing that
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.520]   the rejection of Israel is not total.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.160]   The Apostle proves that in two ways, by saying that he himself is a believer, though he's
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.000]   a Jew, and secondly, that there are other Jews also who are believers.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   There is a remnant according to the election of grace.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.160]   So that proves, beyond any doubt, that the rejection of Israel is not a total one.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.800]   Then in the second division, verse 11 to verse 32, his big point is that it isn't final.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.000]   It isn't a final rejection.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.620]   Now that's the division we are now considering, and I've suggested that it can be naturally
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.800]   subdivided into a number of subsections.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.960]   The first subsection was in verses 11 and 12.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   Here, in verse 11, he introduces the general theme.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.680]   Have they stumbled that they should fall?
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.420]   What is it that's happened to Israel?
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.240]   Is it merely a temporary stumbling, or have they really fallen down finally and completely?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.220]   And at once, he answers by saying, "God forbid."
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.360]   And then leads us into the explanation of why this is only a temporary stumbling and
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.960]   not a final falling.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.240]   He says, "It is rather that through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles."
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.520]   This was one of God's ways of bringing salvation to the Gentiles, and also to provoke the Jews
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.080]   themselves to jealousy by so doing.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.360]   And then, you see, he throws out in verse 12, as we've seen, this tremendous foreview
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   of history.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.040]   "If the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them be the
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.600]   riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness."
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.520]   Now that's the theme of the whole division.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:45.840]   But you remember, we saw that he has a kind of digression in verses 13, 14, and 15.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.080]   He now is speaking personally, and he wants the Gentiles to know why he's making so
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.480]   much of this point.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.560]   And his answer is that he's doing so because of his concern for the Gentiles.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.520]   He is the apostle to the Gentiles, and he magnifies his office.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.000]   He wants them to have a full understanding and enjoyment of their great salvation.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.480]   He puts that like this.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.240]   "I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.500]   I magnify my office.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.880]   If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are of my flesh, I might save some
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.760]   of them."
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   That's what he's doing.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.120]   He's mainly the apostle to the Gentiles, but he does hope that at the same time some Jews
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.600]   will see the truth through his preaching and will be added to the church.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.800]   He doesn't expect many at this stage, but he does hope that some will come.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.080]   But he says, and here you see he returns to his big theme, thrown out in verse 12, "If
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.280]   the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.360]   them be but life from the dead?"
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.960]   Now that's where we ended when we last met on Friday, December the 11th.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.400]   He says that a day is coming when the nation of Israel as a whole, as it were, it doesn't
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.440]   mean every single individual, but the nation in bulk, are going to see the truth and believe
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   it.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.320]   And when that happens, it's going to be a time of unusual refreshment for the whole
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   church of God, and especially therefore for the Gentiles.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.000]   It will be a most thrilling period.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The nearest we can come to imagining in death is to read of what happens in times of revival.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.320]   But when this great event will take place, it will eclipse every revival that's ever
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   been.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.120]   It will be really like life from the dead.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.040]   There's no other comparison that the apostle can think of that is adequate to convey any
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.600]   kind of impression of what a glorious time it is going to be.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.480]   Now, we come now to this further subsection.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:05.240]   And here he tells us that something further is necessary still to be told.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   The danger is that the Gentiles should misunderstand their whole position with respect to the church
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.120]   and to the Jews and to the whole question of salvation.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.280]   And the apostle wants to safeguard them against that.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:28.120]   So in this subsection, he takes up this matter.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.040]   And that is why it is such an important statement.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:39.560]   It is perhaps the most important statement anywhere in the Bible of the respective positions
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:46.600]   of Jews and Gentiles in the Christian church and their relationship to one another and
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.480]   their relationship together to the whole of the church.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.880]   Now then, here again is something that I want to subdivide.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.960]   In other words, we've got to subdivide what he says from verse 16 to verse 32.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.360]   But I'm only concerned for the moment with the subsection that runs from verse 16 to
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.680]   verse 22.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   That's the first division.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.400]   16 to 22.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   Now, how do we analyse this?
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.360]   Well, I suggest an analysis along these lines.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:40.960]   In verses 16 and 17, he states the fundamental relationship of Jew and Gentile in the church.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:51.240]   In verses 18 to 21, he issues a serious pastoral warning to the Gentiles not to misunderstand
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   this relationship and not to give way to pride.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:06.200]   And thirdly, in verse 22 itself, he sums up the whole of this particular argument in terms
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.800]   of a general proposition.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:14.600]   "Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God, on them which fell severity, but toward
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.960]   thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:30.440]   Now then, there is a kind of analysis of this immediate portion.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.440]   Now this is a tremendously important matter, I say, for this reason.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.520]   The apostle here does quite a number of things.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:48.000]   The main thing, of course, is to bring out his third argument with respect to the position
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.360]   of the Gentiles as regards salvation and the Christian church.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.040]   You remember his first argument was that he himself is a believer and in the church.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.760]   That secondly, there is this remnant according to the election of grace.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.480]   But now here comes a third great argument.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.760]   And in developing this argument, he gives us this extraordinary insight, not only into
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:21.820]   God's plan and purpose, but into the whole question of the nature of the church and the
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:31.240]   respective places and positions of the Jews and the Gentiles in the church.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:39.760]   And what he really is going to tell us is this, that the Jews, speaking nationally,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:47.800]   have a special place in this whole purpose of God with respect to the church.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.240]   Now I put it like that in general.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.920]   As we go on with the interpretation, we will see that there are dangers and errors that
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.960]   we have to avoid on many sides.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   But there it is in general.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.960]   He is concerned to say, this is his whole argument in the entire chapter, that far from
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:14.200]   the Jews being finished with or cast out finally, they are still in the purpose of God in a
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.480]   national sense.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.680]   But we have got to be very clear as to how that is to be worked out.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.560]   And he will show us this special place of the Jews, particularly in its relationship
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.960]   to the place and the position that is occupied by the Gentiles.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.520]   Now then, let us try to proceed to consider the interpretation of this.
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:48.600]   Let us take our usual course and start first of all with a pure analysis of the statement.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.840]   You notice that he starts with the word "for."
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:59.320]   Here is his connecting link, but really this should not be translated as "for."
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.760]   A better translation here is "but," or "now," or "since."
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:13.000]   Now then, since then, but, because.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Take it like that.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.320]   He is going to put an argument before us.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   It is connected with what has been going before.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:29.880]   He has already thrown out this great idea that a fullness of the Jews is going to come
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.840]   in.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.880]   And he is now going to tell us why that must of necessity be the case.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.600]   That is what he is setting out to prove.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.520]   And here he says, "Well now, this is so, and their coming in will be like life from
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.400]   the dead for the whole church."
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400]   Why?
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.600]   Well, "because," he says, and then he gives us two pictures.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.440]   The first picture is this.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:03.200]   If the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.960]   The second picture is, if the root be holy, so are the branches.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:16.640]   Now these pictures have caused a great deal of trouble to many commentators and to many
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.000]   people who have studied this picture.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So it is important that we should try to be clear about them.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.160]   The difficulty has generally arisen because people, the moment they see this word "first
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.080]   fruit," go off at a tangent.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.560]   What they tend to do, of course, is to get hold of a concordance and look up the references
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.520]   to first fruit, and then they jump at once to various conclusions.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:46.200]   They find that the Lord Jesus Christ is referred to as the first fruit of them that are risen
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.840]   from the dead, and that sends them off along that line.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.800]   Then they remember that at the time of harvest, in the ancient days of the children of Israel,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.760]   they would always gather the first fruit of the harvest and make a meal of it, or they
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.880]   would take an offering and wave it before God.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.480]   The first fruit of the harvest was offered to God.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:16.120]   And they have tended, therefore, to have their exposition controlled almost exclusively by
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.640]   this idea of the first fruit.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.440]   But now many others point out, and it seems to me quite rightly, that that is quite a
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:33.280]   mistake because the apostle is thinking about first fruit here in terms of a lump.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:40.120]   And you don't speak of a lump of grain or a lump of fruit, and that surely ought to
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.240]   put us right on this subject, that we are not dealing, as it were, with a number of
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.680]   sheaves of corn or of something like that gathered and offered up to God, but we are
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.760]   dealing with the first fruit of a lump.
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:00.280]   And there is, of course, in the Old Testament an exact description of the very thing to
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.120]   which the apostle is referring.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:10.380]   You will find it in the book of Numbers in chapter 15 and verses 19 to 21.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.400]   And there is undoubtedly the thing to which the apostle is referring.
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.320]   Let me read these verses to you.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.680]   Let me start at verse 17.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.600]   The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   When ye come into the land whither I bring you, then it shall be that when ye eat of
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.040]   the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.480]   Now then, here is the particular thing.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:42.800]   Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.680]   As ye do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall ye heave it.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:56.880]   Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave offering in your generations.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   So that what we must think of is a lump of dough.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:09.120]   The corn has now been ground, and the meal has been mixed, and it is all there as a mass
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.880]   or a great lump of dough.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:19.160]   Now there to take a bit of that and to bake it into a cake and to offer that to God.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.800]   And the teaching was that the offering of that first bit out of the lump or the mass
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:33.360]   of the dough, the offering of that to God as a holy sacrifice, the setting apart of
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.640]   that or the consecrating, if you like, of that to God, means that the remainder of the
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.160]   lump also becomes holy.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.920]   If the specimen is holy, the whole mass is holy.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.360]   That was the teaching under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.560]   It was God's own teaching to the children of Israel, and the apostle here takes it up
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.120]   and uses it as an illustration.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.080]   But then he comes to the second illustration, which is a much more direct and straightforward
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   one.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:10.160]   He says, "If the root be holy, so also are the branches."
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.080]   Now there's no difficulty here what he's saying.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.280]   Here is this, that there is this essential, intimate, organic relationship between the
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.300]   root and the branches.
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:24.400]   So that what is true of the roots must of necessity be true of the branches.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   The root you plant in the ground, well, you will know exactly what to expect to come up.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.800]   The nature of the root and the branches is one.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.400]   And so he argues that if the root is holy, the branches also must be holy.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   Now the word holy is a bit important here, obviously, and there is really no trouble
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:53.760]   about its interpretation, as long as we realize that it doesn't refer so much to moral character
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:59.800]   as to something which has been consecrated or dedicated to God.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.640]   You mustn't bring in the notion of perfection.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.240]   Sometimes the word holy does carry that meaning.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.760]   When we read that God is holy, it means he's absolutely perfect and sinless.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:18.940]   But the word holy doesn't always mean that, and we must always bear that in mind.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.640]   The word holy in its primary meaning carries this idea, this notion, of something that
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.860]   is set apart for God.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:33.000]   So you get the mount on which the Ten Commandments were given to Moses being referred to as the
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.680]   Holy Mount.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:39.960]   It was a holy mount because God had told them to set it apart and to, they remember, they
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.160]   had to put up fences and the people were not allowed to approach it.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.700]   You read about the vessels in the temple and they're called holy vessels.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.360]   It doesn't mean that there is some unusual purity about them more than any others, but
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.960]   that they've been set apart for this peculiar service of God.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.240]   Or if you want a still better illustration of the use of this word holy, you get it,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:15.300]   of course, in that statement in 1 Corinthians 7, where the apostle is dealing with the position
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.120]   of a wife who's a Christian who's got an unconverted husband, and the whole question
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.200]   of the children.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.440]   You get it there in verses 14 and following.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.800]   "For if the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:36.020]   by the husband, else were your children unclean, but now are they holy."
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.920]   When it says that they're holy, it doesn't mean that they're sinless and that they're
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.920]   perfect.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.640]   All it means is that they're allowed to belong to the church.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.680]   They come, as it were, into the realm of the church.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.760]   It doesn't mean moral purity.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:56.120]   It means that they are amongst God's people, and it means no more than that.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.200]   Very well, because the same thing is said about the unbelieving partner.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.740]   Well now, there are the terms.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.600]   So the apostle is arguing like this.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:14.620]   He says if that first bit of dough is consecrated and dedicated to God in that way, well, there's
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.480]   no doubt that God has said that he will regard the whole lump in the same light.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.040]   And as I say, the second picture is that the root determines the nature of the tree and
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.880]   the branches.
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.920]   The question that arises for our interpretation, and this is where you've had a variety of
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.760]   opinions, is how do we now regard these two pictures?
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:47.780]   It seems to me to be quite clear that they really are both saying exactly the same thing.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.640]   Why then do you say that the apostle used two illustrations?
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.200]   The answer to that is that this is something which is done quite commonly.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.280]   He remembered that teaching in the Old Testament, but he thinks of this second illustration
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.200]   which helps him to work out the point he's anxious to explain more fully than does the
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:15.080]   one of the portion of this lump of dough which has been consecrated to God.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:18.600]   So he gives the first illustration, he adds a second, and it's the second that he takes
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.180]   up and works out.
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:27.020]   But the majority of commentators are agreed that we must interpret the two pictures as
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.880]   conveying the same essential teaching.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.680]   So the question before us really comes to this.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.640]   To whom does the term "first fruits" refer?
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.640]   To whom does the word "root" refer?
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:48.400]   The first fruit is to the lump exactly what the root is to the branches.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.240]   So the question is, what's the meaning of the first fruit and the root?
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:01.920]   Now here there are two main expositions which have been put forward.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.560]   There is a third.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.440]   I think it's most unusual and most uncommon.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.800]   I merely mention it because I actually find it in the works of B.W.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.480]   Newton, one of the well-known and famous writers amongst the Plymouth brethren during the last
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.040]   century.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   He takes the astonishing view that the first fruit referred to here means Christians, even
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:37.780]   ourselves included, all those who belong to the Christian Church before this great day
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.840]   that is going to come, that is referred to in verse 15.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:50.160]   Now that I really feel is an idea that can only have arisen in his mind because he was
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.600]   governed solely, as I say, by this word "first fruits."
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.160]   And therefore he argues, you see, everything before the actual harvest is first fruits.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   So all believers up until the day when Israel as a nation believes, he regards as first
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.480]   fruits.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.600]   I really can see nothing whatsoever in favor of such an exposition.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:18.320]   So we can content ourselves with concentrating upon the other two ideas.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:27.440]   Now quite a common interpretation of this matter is this, that the first fruit is a
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:32.480]   reference to the first Jewish converts.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.240]   I mean by that people like the Apostle Paul himself.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:43.400]   The first believers were, after all, says this argument, Jews.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.880]   And therefore they are the first fruit.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.400]   And what the Apostle is saying here is this, that as the first believers of the Gospel
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   were Jews, start in Jerusalem, then go to Samaria, then to the uttermost parts of the
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   earth.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.320]   And they quote our Lord's statement to the woman of Samaria, salvation is of the Jews.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.160]   So they argue that the first fruit is a reference to the first Jewish Christians and that the
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.800]   Apostle is arguing that as the first believers were Jews, so the great harvest is going to
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.240]   be that of Jews also.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:28.120]   Now this is quite a popular interpretation, especially at the present time.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.160]   I was interested to notice that Professor F.F.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:40.440]   Bruce in his Tyndale commentary issued in the last few years tends to take this point
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440]   of view.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   He puts it like this.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:45.560]   He says here, but you notice he's careful, he's not quite happy about it.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:52.520]   Here the first fruit most probably comprises those people of Jewish birth who had, like
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:57.920]   Paul, accepted Jesus as Messiah and Lord.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.440]   But as he goes on, he isn't quite as happy about it.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.960]   He goes on to say, "If the root be holy, so are the branches."
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.360]   Changing the metaphor, Paul now says that since the whole of the tree is of one character
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.480]   throughout, the holiness of the root sanctifies the branches.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.240]   It is natural to give the root the same significance as the first root.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.640]   But if the root and branch figure stood by itself, we should think of the patriarchs
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.440]   as constituting the root of the tree, whose branches are the Israelites of the Christian
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.560]   era.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.280]   This would be in line with Paul's later description of Israel as beloved for the Father's sake,
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   verse 28.
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:40.360]   Perhaps there is a transition of thought here as Paul passes from one metaphor to the other.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.480]   And then he adds still another further thought because he's got a footnote.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:50.360]   It is of course possible to interpret the first fruit of verse 16 of the patriarchs,
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.520]   but this is a less likely interpretation.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.040]   Now I quote that to you in order to show that he clearly finds it difficult.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.240]   He doesn't give us his reasons, but he just says that it is a less likely interpretation.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.960]   Now I want to suggest to you that it is not less likely, but much more likely, and indeed
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.160]   the only one that seems to me to be harmonious with the whole argument.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.240]   As he finds himself saying, the more you think of it in terms of root and branches, the more
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.280]   you are compelled to adopt another explanation rather than this.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.880]   But it seems to me that the argument which should be final at this point is this.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:43.720]   If you say that the first fruit and the root means believing Jews like the apostle Paul
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:56.520]   and others, well then you must say that the branches, namely the Jews at present and converted,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:04.480]   but who are later to be converted, correspond to the branches that come out of this particular
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   root.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:17.040]   In other words, you are saying that the unconverted Jews are the branches which come out of the
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.760]   Jews converted at the time of the apostle Paul and others.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.360]   Now that seems to me to be entirely wrong for this reason, that the whole argument of
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.440]   the entire chapter is to say this, that the whole bulk of the nation is outside, it is
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   temporarily rejected.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.120]   He'll say this, this temporary blindness.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.360]   There is no connection there.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:43.440]   So we cannot say that he is arguing that these are branches that come out of that particular
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.360]   root.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.200]   It is inconceivable that he should say so.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   Very well then, what is the exposition?
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.280]   Well I take the one that has already been quoted to you.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.880]   The only natural interpretation here, surely, especially as we bear in mind the apostles'
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:09.320]   whole fundamental objective, is to say that the first root consists of the patriarchs.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.760]   I mean by that Abram, Isaac, and Jacob in particular.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   Why?
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.320]   Well, because they were the beginning of the Jewish nation.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.620]   They are the root of the Jewish nation.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:31.320]   They are this first fruit, the lump, the first portion of the great nation that came.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:37.720]   There was a point when it was just Abram alone, but then come Isaac and Jacob, and you get
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.080]   these constant references, therefore, in the scripture to the God of Abram, Isaac, and
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080]   of Jacob.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.320]   There you have your first fruit.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:57.380]   Now you notice that when he comes to talk about the other picture, it is in the singular.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:03.800]   If the root be holy, he argues, so are the branches.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:11.380]   And here, I don't hesitate to assert, is a reference to Abraham himself, Abraham alone.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.900]   Abraham, after all, is the root of the Jewish nation.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:21.260]   Now my argument is, you see, that the apostle is concerned in the whole of this chapter
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.940]   with the Jews as a nation, the Jews as a whole.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:32.780]   And he is going to substantiate this statement of his that a day is coming when as a bulk
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:33.780]   they will come in.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:39.340]   Now this is his argument, the beginning, the first cake that was offered of the baked dough,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.340]   that was holy.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.740]   The root, which is Abraham himself, was holy.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.260]   Now, what comes out of Abraham belongs to the same general and essential category.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.860]   Now my justification for arguing like this is this.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.620]   We have already found him in the fourth chapter of this great epistle, referring to Abraham
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.700]   in this very sense.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:07.540]   What shall we say then, says verse 1, what shall we say then that Abraham, our father
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:11.380]   as pertaining to the flesh, has found?
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:16.180]   Abraham is the father of the Jewish nation.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.540]   He is the root out of which they have all come.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:25.700]   They were very proud of this and the apostle is reminding them of it.
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:32.220]   Now you recall that the prophets of the Old Testament often used this precise argument.
[00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.580]   Let me give you one in the prophet Isaiah in chapter 51, verses 1 and 2.
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:47.820]   "Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the Lord.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.720]   Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:31:00.260]   Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you, for I called him alone, and
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:03.740]   blessed him, and increased him."
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.740]   That's it.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:10.980]   He is the father, he is the pit out of which this rock has been hewn.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.860]   And of course you get the apostle Paul using exactly the same argument in the third chapter
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.100]   of the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.300]   Look at verses 14 to 16.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.100]   He says that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law.
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.100]   Why?
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:33.980]   Well, that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.780]   That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.460]   "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:47.540]   Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disanolith or addeth
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:48.540]   thereto.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.620]   Now to Abraham and his seed where the promise is made."
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:32:00.020]   And especially at the end of this chapter in verses 28 and 29.
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:08.020]   There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female,
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.820]   for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:22.980]   And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:32.060]   Very well then, that I say should drive us to the inevitable conclusion that the root
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:37.980]   out of which the branches come is none other than Abraham.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:47.220]   He is the beginning even as the patriarchs in general are the first root of this mess,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.340]   this lump of dough.
[00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:55.660]   Now there is a pure bit of exposition, what it all leads us to.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:02.460]   Here I argue that before we can arrive at a definite conclusion, we've got to consider
[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:09.740]   the statement of verse 17, because it helps us to understand verse 16.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:16.660]   "If some of the branches be broken off, and thou a wild olive tree wert grafted among
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.260]   them, and with them partakest of the root and the fatness of the olive tree."
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.940]   Now we needn't follow the argument for the moment.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:32.300]   All we need consider is this, that he tells us that some of the branches have been broken
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   off and that others from a wild olive tree have been grafted in, and that they begin
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   to partake of the root and the fatness of the olive tree.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.060]   Now here is a tremendous statement, and this is the point at which some of the commentators
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.840]   say that we are dealing with the most difficult matter in the whole of the scripture.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.080]   This whole question of the olive tree, what is the picture?
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:08.120]   What exactly is the apostle saying, leading up to the question of what then is the olive
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.300]   tree that he's talking about?
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:17.500]   And this is again where you get your variety of interpretations and expositions.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.700]   Now the apostle puts a picture before us.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:26.860]   He says here is a good olive tree, here is a wild one.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:31.700]   Because some of the branches of the good olive tree are not bearing fruit, they are cut off,
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.820]   thrown away.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:40.300]   And some branches are taken from that wild olive tree and they are grafted into this
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.400]   good olive tree.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:49.700]   The meaning of the phrase "grafted among them" really is grafted in their place, grafted
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.560]   instead of them.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.080]   We don't say "grafted" today, we say "grafted."
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.700]   But that of course doesn't make any difference.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.180]   That's simply the question of the usage of language.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.020]   Now where does the difficulty arise?
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:12.780]   Well it's almost amusing to read the commentators on this important verse.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.900]   Large numbers of them immediately begin to say something like this.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:24.500]   That the apostle Paul here very clearly shows that he knew nothing at all about horticulture,
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.620]   that he was mainly a townsman, and that he does the most foolish thing which preachers
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.500]   are given to doing, but which they should never do, using an illustration when they
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.420]   don't know enough about the subject from which they are culling their illustration.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:44.300]   They say, "Here is the apostle Paul telling us that the picture is, the relationship of
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.020]   the Gentile to the Jew in the church is, it's exactly as if you take a bit of a wild olive
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:55.020]   tree, which is very poor in the matter of fruit production, and you graft it into a
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.020]   good olive tree."
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.220]   Well, they say it's elementary of course, any man who knows anything at all about horticulture
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.460]   knows that that is something that is just never done.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.220]   What is done is the exact opposite.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:15.300]   You always graft a good branch into one that isn't as good.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   And the result is you will then get a greater crop out of this grafted in branch.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.460]   It makes use of the life and the sap that is in the other, but you never do it the other
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.460]   way around.
[00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:30.740]   So they say this is quite elementary and it's merely indicative of the apostles' ignorance
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.660]   of this matter.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.100]   Well then you see, they begin to do research work.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:46.180]   And then they find that sometimes that is actually done after all.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.580]   It isn't common practice.
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:55.020]   But certain scholars, William Ramsey in particular, was a great archaeologist and interested in
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.220]   these matters.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.980]   He discovered that this was sometimes done.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:06.380]   And if you had a good olive tree which was becoming rather lethargic and lazy, it wasn't
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   a bad thing to graft into that a bit of a wild olive tree.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.340]   And this new graft would provide a kind of stimulus to the old tree and wake it up again
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.900]   and make it produce better fruit and even produce fairly good fruit on the graft that
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:22.060]   you had grafted in.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.340]   And so they feel that after all, you know, the apostle Paul knew more about this business
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.820]   of horticulture than some of his critics tend to imagine.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:30.820]   And so on.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.860]   And this is the great matter.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:41.620]   Now all that seems to me to be completely and entirely irrelevant.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:48.140]   And it shows the danger of going off a tangent because of some supposed special knowledge.
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.940]   Now I could easily elaborate on this point, people are tending to do it today.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.180]   I know people who say now we understand things in the Bible we didn't before because of our
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.660]   recent knowledge.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:05.580]   The moment you say that, you've already gone wrong.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.740]   Because obviously the apostle uses illustrations which could be understood two thousand years
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.820]   ago.
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.780]   And if you can only understand an illustration in terms of modern scientific knowledge, you're
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.780]   wrong.
[00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.900]   Modern knowledge wasn't available then, so the apostle's illustration would have been
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.980]   of no value.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:29.940]   But I say it is entirely of no value to us for this reason.
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:37.660]   That the apostle himself tells us in verse 24 that he is referring to something that
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.460]   is not according to nature.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.860]   For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graft contrary
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.540]   to nature into a good olive tree.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.380]   You see this is a tremendous point here.
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:39:00.420]   The apostle says God has done something that is unusual.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.120]   God has done something that is miraculous.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:11.300]   God has done something that enables even a wild olive tree to produce good olives.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.500]   This is regeneration if you like.
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.820]   God doesn't act according to nature in the matter of salvation.
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:20.940]   It takes a miracle to save a man.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.420]   It takes a miracle to save the Gentiles.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.540]   God does something contrary to nature, supernatural.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:35.780]   He tells us that so that we needn't waste any of our time in this recondite archaeological
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.260]   discovery and try some way or another to justify the great apostle.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.740]   The great apostle tells us exactly what he's saying.
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.220]   He says this is the most amazing thing.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.260]   Who would ever have imagined that there was any hope for the people like the Gentiles?
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:54.820]   But God, because he is God and because of the whole miraculous supernatural grace element,
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.660]   God is able to do this tremendous thing.
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:05.300]   And he says that is exactly and precisely what God has done.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:13.100]   Well now then, it seems to me that we have given an exposition of the actual meaning
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.020]   of our terms.
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.260]   And I think it puts us into a position in which we will be able next Friday night, God
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:26.460]   willing, to tackle this vital question.
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.820]   What is the olive tree?
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.180]   That's the whole key.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:40.980]   Your exposition of the olive tree will decide exactly the view you take of the precise place
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.420]   of the Jews in the economy of God and in salvation.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.460]   It will determine your view probably on certain events in connection with the second coming
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.820]   and the whole of the future.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:58.420]   There is a teaching, as you know, which says that the Jews will always occupy a unique
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.380]   and special position.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.460]   That the church will be divided into two sections.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.300]   There will be a heavenly section and an earthly section and so on and so forth.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:10.180]   All this is very relevant to that.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:16.620]   And now, having prepared the groundwork, as it were, having looked at the terms and having
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.100]   seen in general what the apostle is saying, what he is saying is this.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.540]   There is an olive tree.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.100]   There were natural branches.
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.180]   They have been cut off and thrown away.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.300]   Others have been put in.
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.100]   But still, natural branches are going to come in again.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   That's the main statement.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.580]   How exactly is this to be worked out in detail?
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:44.020]   What does he actually mean with respect to the Jews and the Gentiles?
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:50.380]   Well, as I say, God willing, I hope to look with you at this great statement about the
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.260]   olive tree next Friday evening.
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.260]   Let us pray.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:42:06.740]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy holy presence once more and we come marveling more than
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.100]   ever at the mystery of thy grace and of thy ways.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:22.700]   O God, we thank thee for this root and fatness of which we thy people are partakers.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:29.620]   We thank thee, O Lord, for the miracle of redeeming grace and of redemption.
[00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:35.440]   We thank thee for the miracle of the rebirth and of regeneration.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:43.460]   We thank thee, O Lord, that because of this fatness of this blessed root there is the
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.180]   possibility for all.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:51.980]   O Lord, we pray thee to receive our praise and to increase our understanding of this
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.260]   glorious matter.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:00.860]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, the fellowship and the
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:07.780]   communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:15.940]   of this hour's short and sudden earthly life and pilgrimage and evermore.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.060]   Amen.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
