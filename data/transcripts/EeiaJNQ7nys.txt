[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.540]   So what assurances do we have that the human fall into sin will not repeat
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.000]   itself in heaven? This is a question from Nicholas in Camacho, Florida, who sent us
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.480]   an email to ask. "Pastor John, I have often worried that after some time, after
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.720]   being in heaven, I will sin against God. If the devil, once perfect and in God's
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.360]   presence, fell into sin, what does that mean for us who are justified sinners?
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.760]   Could the sin of Eden be repeated in heaven? The thought that I might still
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   sin against God when I am in heaven has plagued me for some time. Does the Bible
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   offer Christians any hope that we will forever not sin once we are glorified?"
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.120]   Yes, it does, and no, the fall will not be repeated in heaven. So here's why.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.720]   The reason that we who are united to Christ by faith in his glorious work on
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:12.800]   the cross and in the resurrection is that this blood which he shed seals a
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.760]   new covenant. That's why it's not going to happen. We're not going to fall like
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:28.680]   Satan did or like Adam did. One of the marks of the new covenant is not only
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.720]   that God gives us eternal life, but also that God commits himself, because of
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.880]   Christ, to keep us from doing anything that would jeopardize our eternal life.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.120]   In other words, the newness of the new covenant is precisely that God is
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.840]   committed to keeping us from falling away the way Satan did or Adam and Eve
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.400]   did in their days of innocence. They were not the beneficiaries of the blood-bought
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.760]   new covenant. We are. Jesus said this at the Last Supper, "This cup is poured out
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.520]   for you, and it is the new covenant in my blood." And I take that to mean that
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.760]   everyone who is covered by this blood through faith in Christ is a beneficiary
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.040]   of that covenant. It's a blood-bought covenant. Those in Christ, covered by
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.680]   Christ's atoning work, are beneficiaries of this new covenant. And what God
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.800]   commits himself to do in this new covenant is spelled out in Jeremiah 31,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.280]   Ezekiel 11, Ezekiel 36, Jeremiah 32—let me just read a few phrases from those.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.880]   "I will make"—this is Jeremiah 31, 31 following—"I will make a new covenant with the
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.720]   house of Israel and the house of Judah," which Jesus now is applying to his new
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.040]   Israel, the people of God who are in Christ. "That I will put my law within
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.680]   them, and I will write it on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   shall be my people, and I will forgive their iniquity and remember their sins
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.680]   no more than Ezekiel 11, 19. I will remove the heart of stone from their
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.720]   flesh, and I will give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.960]   and keep my rules." And here's the best of all—this is Jeremiah 32, 40—"I will make
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.920]   with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.280]   them, and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn away
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.600]   from me." Now, that is the bottom line new covenant commitment. Let me read it again.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.080]   "I will not turn away from doing good to them. I will put the fear of me in their
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.440]   hearts." In other words, it doesn't depend on us. God's gonna take charge of keeping us.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.760]   "That they will not turn away from me." That's the point of my putting
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.480]   my fear within them. I won't let them turn away from me. In other words, the glory of
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.640]   the new covenant is that God will never find himself in the position where his
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.040]   redeemed people turn against him, because the very heart of the new covenant is
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.760]   that he won't let it happen. "I will put the fear of me in their hearts. They will
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.840]   not turn from me." It's precisely this keeping power of God, this keeping
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.880]   commitment of God, which Jude sees as the mark of God's majesty and dominion and
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.640]   authority. I preached on this a couple of years ago at Together for the Gospel. I
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.400]   was so moved by it as I came to the end of my pastoral time, looking back over 33
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.000]   years and saying, "He kept me. He kept me. I still believe. Can you believe that? I
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.400]   still believe. I wake up in the morning a Christian every morning putting my faith
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.840]   in Jesus. Why?" And here's what it says, "Now to him who is able to keep you from
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.360]   stumbling, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.960]   and majesty, dominion and authority before all time, now and forever." Why did
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.400]   Jude rise to that level of acclamation? He did it because he was so stunned that
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.720]   God has devoted his entire being to keeping his children. That's the
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.280]   connection, that the very majesty and dominion and authority of God are behind
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.000]   the stipulations of the new covenant. He will keep his people from stumbling. He
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.560]   will present us blameless. He will keep us blameless. And here's one more aspect
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.800]   of the new covenant that underlines the same glorious truth. The resurrection of
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:16.840]   Christ led to his new role as the Redeemer in heaven who continually
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.640]   intercedes on behalf of the saints. Isn't it as though he did a saving work for us
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.280]   and then he went on a vacation forever, kind of disappeared, and the cross does
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   it all? No, no. Christ does it all by mediating the work of the cross to the
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.020]   Father and applying it to us day by day. There's no reason to believe this is
[00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.520]   going to cease because Hebrews 7:25 says, "Consequently, he," Christ, "is able to save
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:55.160]   to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him since he always lives to
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.400]   make intercession for them." Amazing. And here's an example of what he prays for.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:07.720]   So what does Jesus pray? Always, forever, into eternity, making intercession.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.880]   Luke 22 31, Jesus says to Simon Peter, just before he denies him, "Simon, Simon,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   behold, Satan demanded to have you that he might sift you like wheat. But I have
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.760]   prayed for you that your faith may not fail, and when you have turned again," when
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.960]   you have turned again, not if, "when you have turned again, strengthen your
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.280]   brothers." In other words, the intercessory work of Jesus on behalf of
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:39.200]   his people is to pray that our faith not fail. And even though Peter, in that part
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.240]   of redemptive history, before glorification, denied the Lord, he did not
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.560]   let him deny the Lord utterly. He didn't let him fail in his faith utterly. And
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   once we obtain our glorified bodies and are completely conformed, says 1 John,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:04.160]   to Christ when he appears, that eternal intercession of Jesus will keep us from
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:12.400]   any sinning. This is what he bought for us in the blood forever. Yes, amen. What
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.680]   precious blood that is. Thank you, Pastor John. And thanks for listening to the

[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.080]   week with another gem of a question, and that is, "What truths in the world do we
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.200]   need that we cannot find in our Bibles?" That is a very shrewd question, and I'll
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.480]   pose it to Pastor John tomorrow. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.440]   the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper. We'll see you tomorrow.
