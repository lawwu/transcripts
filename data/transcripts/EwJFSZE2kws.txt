[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   So you didn't suffer 1 billion, but presumably there's some amount you would have sold for,
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.080]   right? Did you write down in your head, like, "I think the actual valuation of Facebook at the
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.760]   time is this," and they're not actually getting the valuation right? They did it for $5 trillion,
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.760]   of course you would have sold. So how did you think about that choice?
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.040]   Yeah, I don't know. I mean, look, I think some of these things are just personal.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.800]   I don't know at the time that I was sophisticated enough to do that analysis,
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.920]   but I had all these people around me who were making all these arguments for how, like,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.360]   "A billion dollars, here's the revenue that we need to make, and here's how big we need to be,
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.800]   and it's clearly so many years in the future." It was very far ahead of where we were at the time.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.440]   And I don't know, I didn't really have the financial sophistication to really even engage
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.360]   with that kind of debate. I think I sort of deep down believed in what we were doing.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.520]   And I did some analysis. I was like, "Okay, well, what would I go do if I wasn't doing this?" It's
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.920]   like, "Well, I really like building things, and I like helping people communicate, and I like
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.680]   understanding what's going on with people and the dynamics between people. So I think if I sold this
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.840]   company, I'd just go build another company like this." And I kind of like the one I have. So I
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:27.760]   mean, why? But I don't know. I think a lot of the biggest bets that people make are often just based
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.880]   on conviction and values. It's actually usually very hard to do the analyses trying to connect
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.160]   the dots forward. You didn't sell the company for a billion dollars, and like the metaverse,
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.640]   you knew we were going to do this even though the market was hammering you for it. And then
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   I'm actually curious, what is the source of that edge? And you said, "Oh, values, I have this
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.600]   intuition." But everybody says that, right? If you had to say something that's specific to you,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680]   how would you express what that is? Why were you so convinced about the metaverse?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.960]   Well, I think that those are different questions. So what are the things that kind of power me?
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   I think we've talked about a bunch of things. I just really like building things.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.960]   I specifically like building things around how people communicate and sort of understanding
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.920]   how people express themselves and how people work. When I was in college, I studied computer
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.600]   science and psychology. I think a lot of other people in the industry studied computer science.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.840]   It's always been sort of the intersection of those two things for me. But I think it's also
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.080]   sort of this really deep drive. I don't know how to explain it, but I just feel
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   constitutionally like I'm doing something wrong if I'm not building something new.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:56.720]   Even when we're putting together the business case for investing $100 billion in AI or some huge
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.120]   amount in the metaverse, it's like, yeah, I mean, we have plans that I think make it pretty clear
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.600]   that if our stuff works, it'll be a good investment. But you can't know for certain
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   from the outset. There's all these arguments that people have, whether it's with advisors or
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.120]   different folks. It's like, well, how are you confident enough to do this? And it's like, well,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.440]   the day I stop trying to build new things, I'm just done. I'm going to go build new things
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   somewhere else. It's like I'm fundamentally incapable of running something or in my own
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   life and not trying to build new things that I think are interesting. That's not even a question
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.320]   for me. It's not like whether we're going to go take a swing at building the next thing.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   I'm just incapable of not doing that.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.060]   [END]
