[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   Probably one of the most difficult things about parenting is knowing when and how to
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.560]   explain to our children the reality of God's eternal judgment.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.640]   This is a hard truth and of course we can wield it unwisely, but it's also an essential
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.360]   truth and we are obligated to help our children to understand.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360]   But how do we go about it?
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.680]   It's a question from Michael.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.980]   "Pastor John, how can I talk to my six-year-old son about a hell when any loved one who has
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.240]   died has been a Christian?
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.480]   I've told them that they have gone to heaven, but if somebody dies who is not a Christian,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920]   I do not want to lie to say that they have gone to heaven, but I do not know how to teach
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.760]   him about hell.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.440]   He has extreme anxiety about death and I'm afraid talking about hell may make him even
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.080]   more anxious.
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.640]   He also gets very upset when he makes any kind of mistake or when I have to correct
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   him.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.240]   I do not want him to worry that if he disobeys that he will be sent to hell.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.260]   How in the world can I teach him about God's eternal judgment?"
[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:10.600]   Let me start by turning the tables and saying we should be a hundred times more concerned
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.060]   about a six-year-old who has no fear of death and hell than we are about a child who fears
[00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.720]   death and hell.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.960]   One of the reasons we may not feel that is because when a child has no fear, we tend
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.280]   to go along as though all is well.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.640]   He's such a happy little fellow and she's such a cheerful little girl, but when a child
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.560]   has anxieties, nightmares, fears, then all of our parental instincts and mind go into
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:53.120]   gear and action because we want to help them, not realizing perhaps that the child with
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.160]   no fear needs even more help for parental vigilance and concern than the child with
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.800]   much fear.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.680]   So I want to encourage Michael that the problem he is dealing with is a good problem to have.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.520]   And if he were not dealing with it, there would be more reason to be concerned than
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.880]   there is now.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   So how do we help a six-year-old child deal with the terrifying reality of hell and death?
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:43.000]   The main thing is to realize that God intends for our real and wise fear of hell to be a
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.400]   means of clarifying and establishing in our hearts at least five great realities, five
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.440]   great truths.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.880]   God does not intend for his children to experience hell as an end, but to experience the warning
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:11.540]   of hell as a means of clarifying and establishing these five great realities.
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.440]   And this is true for a six-year-old and it's true for a 60-year-old.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.820]   So look at this moment, Michael, in the child's life as a golden opportunity for teaching
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.520]   him many wonderful things.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.500]   Hell is simply the backdrop against which those things will now become gloriously real.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.500]   Here they are.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.860]   First, the fear of hell is a golden opportunity for treating God as big and glorious and utterly
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.860]   real.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.460]   It is hard for human beings who are sinful to feel the reality of God.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:06.500]   But if God is the one who created hell and whose majesty makes hell just and understandable,
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.020]   then this is a golden moment.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.640]   The reason hell is so terrible is because God is so great that despising him is so evil
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.860]   that it deserves this terrible punishment.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:29.040]   In other words, the horror of hell is a signpost concerning the infinite worth and preciousness
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.460]   and beauty and goodness and justice of God.
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.120]   If he were small, if God were small, hell would be lukewarm.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.540]   Because he's great, scorning God is a horrible thing.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:57.660]   So this is a golden moment for how to teach a child about how real and how great God is.
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.820]   Second, the fear of hell is a golden opportunity to teach about the nature and the exceedingly
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.420]   great seriousness of sin.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.620]   Hell is all about the outcome of a life of sin.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.820]   And therefore a child needs to understand what sin is.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.700]   And sin is all about falling short of God's glory, that is, failing to see God as glorious
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.420]   and honor him and thank him as glorious and to follow him and praise him and glorify him.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.900]   We need to make sure that our children see the direct connection between hell and sin.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:52.140]   The great and frightening tragedy of growing up feeling no fear of hell is that in a life
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.420]   like that, children will not be able to see sin as serious.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:03.420]   It won't ever get to the point where sin is ugly and outrageous because they haven't
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.940]   schooled themselves on the penalty for sin, namely hell.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.340]   They will not see it as a great and horrible offense against God.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.780]   So fearing hell is a golden opportunity for bringing our children into the light concerning
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.740]   the horrible darkness of sin.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.860]   Third, the fear of hell is a golden opportunity to bring the child to an awareness of the
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.060]   reality and justice of God's final judgment.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.460]   This is a great and central biblical teaching that all human beings will stand before God,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.580]   give an account of their lives someday.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:50.420]   Hebrews 9, 27, "Just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.460]   judgment."
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:00.380]   What a gift for a child to grow up deeply convinced that the whole world will face judgment
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.380]   someday.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.100]   This will give seriousness to the child's life.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.820]   Parents, I think, worry far too much that their children will be unhappy in the fear
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.060]   of judgment when they ought to worry that their children will be happy with no fear
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.440]   of judgment.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.420]   So hell is a golden opportunity to bring children into the light and the reality of God's final
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   judgment.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.220]   And this is the key, this is the absolute key to everything.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:44.400]   The fear of hell is a golden opportunity to magnify the cross of Christ and the greatness
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.260]   of Christ and His sacrifice, and the greatness of His love, and the greatness of His mercy,
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:56.600]   and the greatness of His patience, and the greatness of His compassion, and the greatness
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.780]   of His nearness and His friendship, and the greatness of His tenderness towards children,
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.000]   and the greatness of His power and authority over death and hell.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.080]   What a golden moment for children to meet and know the living Christ and the glories
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.060]   of what He achieved on the cross.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:27.520]   The remedy of our children's fear is not to hide hell, but to reveal Christ and the cross.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:34.940]   We should be prepared to paint the achievements of the cross in such lavish colors that they
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.880]   outshine the fears of hell.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.520]   One of the great purposes of the warnings of hell among God's people is to help us see
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.920]   the greatness of the achievement of the death of Christ to deliver us from the fear of hell.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:59.080]   So every night, I've done this, every night when you walk into your child's room because
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:10.320]   of a nightmare about death or hell or judgment, the remedy is not to say that hell is unreal
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.080]   or to in any way minimize the terrors of it.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.960]   The remedy is to sing to them, to sing with them about the triumphs of Jesus over this
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.880]   great enemy.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.760]   Jesus lives and so shall I.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.440]   A great song, Jesus lives I know full well.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.240]   Not from Him my heart can sever.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.920]   Life nor death nor powers of hell, joy nor grief henceforth forever.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.320]   None of all His saints is lost.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.680]   Jesus is my hope and trust.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.120]   They're going to hear Daddy's confidence.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:00.720]   They're going to hear it as Daddy sings about the triumph of the cross over hell.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:08.680]   Can you rub their back and hum the song to them as they fall asleep in gospel peace?
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   That's the goal.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.200]   Picture it this way.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:19.080]   If a great army were coming against your village and your child knew it and was terrified,
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.440]   how would you give him comfort?
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.960]   Would you lie to him and say, "Well, those cannons are just firecrackers."
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.100]   Baloney, you wouldn't do that.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.520]   You would point him to some real basis of hope, of deliverance.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:40.080]   And that's what Christ has achieved infallibly for all who trust Him.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.480]   So the fear of hell is a golden opportunity for grasping the greatness of the work of
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.840]   Christ who died for us so that we might not endure wrath.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.960]   Tell the children, 1 Thessalonians 5, 9.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:04.120]   Just look them right in the eye and say, "God has not planned, destined us for wrath or
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.680]   hell, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us so that
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.000]   whether we wake or sleep, we will live with Him."
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.640]   And here's number five.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:24.040]   The fear of hell is a golden opportunity to bring your child into the experience of a
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.280]   fearless life of faith.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   If you can teach your child fearlessness in the face of hell on the basis of Jesus' death
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:40.560]   and resurrection, you will have given him the ground of total fearlessness in life.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   Make him a warrior or her a warrior because there isn't anything greater that they could
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.200]   ever face.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.960]   Nothing will threaten them more than sin and death and hell.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.840]   And if they know how to conquer sin and death and hell through Christ, then they can face
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   anything.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.520]   They'll be fearless in life.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.920]   And what good will they do then?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:10.040]   What great achievements will they accomplish when they face down every enemy with fearlessness
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.600]   because they've learned from you when they were six that nothing can throw them into
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   hell, even though hell is a horrific enemy.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.720]   So don't run away from this opportunity.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   Don't miss this golden moment of using the fear of hell as a means of clarifying and
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.560]   establishing the truth, number one, of a great and glorious God.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.280]   Number two, the truth of a horrible nature of sin.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.480]   Number three, the reality and justice of future judgment.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:48.000]   Number four, the greatness of the cross and Christ's rescue from hell.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.560]   And five, the glory of a fearless life of faith.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.540]   That is priceless, Council Pastor John.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.360]   Thank you for addressing this.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.200]   This is one of the most helpful episodes I think I've ever heard from you to me as a
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   dad.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   So thank you.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.120]   And thanks for listening to this podcast as well.

[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.560]   Well speaking of questions not easy to answer, we're going to hear from a listener who has
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.140]   a beef with you, Pastor John, especially in how you describe saving faith.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.880]   You have written things like this, "Receiving Christ as your supreme treasure is what faith
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   is."
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.640]   You've written this, "An essential element of saving faith is treasuring Christ above
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.240]   all things."
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:54.760]   Or you said this, "Faith includes the embrace of Jesus as our all satisfying treasure."
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:00.400]   But is this treasuring language actually reading too much into what saving faith is as simply
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.200]   a trusting in Christ?
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.920]   That's the question on the table Friday.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920]   It's a good one.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.920]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime pastor and author and
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   dad, John Piper.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   We'll see you then.
