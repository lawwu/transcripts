[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Well, if the book of Acts proves anything, it proves that Jesus Christ is living and reigning and orchestrating everything for the flourishing of his bride, the church.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This means that Jesus is not dead, and he's not absent, and he is certainly not boring or predictable.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Jesus can turn any circumstance around.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Here's how John Piper explained it in a 1991 sermon on the conversion of Paul.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now, what I want to happen in this message is that your heart would be encouraged from the truth in this text that Jesus is alive and that he turns things around.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   That's the phrase I want you to take away.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Jesus turns things around.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Or another way to put it would be, I want you to go away with a kind of open-ended expectancy about your heart, your mind, your personality, your family, your work, your world, your city, your school, that Jesus turns things around.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   That believing in the Jesus of the book of Acts means believing that he breaks in and turns things around.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I think one of the most debilitating, one of the most devastating feelings in the human heart is fatalism.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And what I mean by that big word, fatalism, is that it'll never change.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I won't ever change.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   She won't ever change.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   My kids won't ever change.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   My job won't ever change.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   This city won't ever change.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   School won't ever change.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The world won't ever change.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Abortion won't ever change.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   You name it, we're stuck with it.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   The powers are too deeply entrenched.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We're just going to have to gut it out.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It ain't going to change.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   That's fatalism.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And I think that's an attitude that Jesus doesn't like at all because it's kind of practical atheism.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It doesn't reckon with the God of the book of Acts who comes in and changes things.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I think the message of the book of Acts is that that is not true.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Fatalism is not true.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I think that's the message of the book of Acts.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Jesus is not dead.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He's not silent.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   He's not disinterested.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He's not weak.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He is alive.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   He is powerful.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   He butts in and he changes life.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   He works new things.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   He does not like being put in the category of a boring, predictable person.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He's not boring and he's not predictable.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   He is full of surprises.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Jesus changes things.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   He turns things around.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Churches, nations, families, personalities, peoples, enslavements.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He changes.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   He turns people and nations and systems and problems around.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He reverses things.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Let's look at it in the text.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   The persecution that we're about to see the end of here began back in chapter 8.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Verse 1.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   It says, and on that day, that is the day when Stephen was killed, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   But Saul, verse 3, Saul laid waste the church entering house after house.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He dragged off men and women, committed them to prison.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And I can imagine had I lived in that church in that day, that tiny little beleaguered church compared to the huge Roman Empire.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And given the average human personality of not being a hoper and an optimist, I would have said, well, this is just the way it's going to be.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   The Romans are against us.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Pilot.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The Jews are against us.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Namely the Sanhedrin.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The priests are against us.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   They empowered Saul to have these letters to go and drag people into jail.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There's just no hope.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It's too negative, too dangerous.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   There's nothing but persecution all around.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's been this way for quite a while.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's probably going to be this way until the Lord comes back.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And so there's really no sense of hoping that things might turn around.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   That's the way we tend to be.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There are a few wonderfully chronically faith-filled hopers around, but not many.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Most people are given to seeing the darkest side and the most pessimistic view on things and just conclude it's not going to change.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And the book of Acts is written to show you that that's not true.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   That is not true.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Jesus is alive.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   He is almighty.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He is infinitely wise.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Infinitely creative.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Infinitely resourceful.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And he intrudes into this world and he turns things around.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's the message, I believe, of the book of Acts.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He is not, and he dislikes being thought of as boringly predictable.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He is not.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   He is full of surprises.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So suddenly, here in the book of Acts, suddenly, out of the blue, Jesus decides to take the chief persecutor of the church and make him the chief advocate of Christianity.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Now isn't that like Jesus?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Whom shall I pick on here to reverse the state of affairs called persecution?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Aha! I will take Saul, the one who's breathing out murders and threats, and I will stop him dead in his tracks.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   And I won't just kill him.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   That'd be easy.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   That would relieve the church.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Kill him.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Get him off the scene.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I could do that.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But I won't do that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I'll do something better and worse.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   As far as Paul's concerned, or Saul, I will make him into a chief exponent so that the hunter becomes the hunted and the persecutor becomes the persecuted and the killer becomes eventually the killed.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And I will reverse everything in human history on this afternoon on the Damascus Road.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Nobody can conceive of Christianity as we know it, apart from what Paul wrote in the New Testament.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   What Jesus was about to do in one split second on an afternoon on the way to Damascus nobody dreamed of in the early church.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   All the pessimists were about to eat their words, who said, "It'll never be the same. We could never know peace again. We're all going to be beat down forever."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And God reached in and reversed things.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And here's the way Luke in this story drives it home.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   He describes Paul's conversion.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Then he describes Paul's preaching.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Then he describes today Paul's being persecuted to show the reversal is complete.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The persecutor becomes the persecuted.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Look at verse 23.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Luke says that the Jews in Damascus plotted to kill him.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And then he has to escape in verse 25 through the wall in a basket.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   That was so scary and so humiliating for Paul.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   He writes about it over in 2 Corinthians 11 as one of the low points of his life.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Then in verse 29, Luke tells us that the Hellenists, once Paul gets down to Jerusalem, are also seeking to kill him.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So the hunter is now the hunted.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And to escape this time, he has to be sent out of the country on a boat to Tarsus.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And the upshot of this dramatic reversal of one man's life is a dramatic reversal of the whole scene in the church life.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Verse 31 of our text.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   "So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was built up."
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Nobody would have dreamed of it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It wasn't going to happen.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   "We were on a downward spiral to trouble and persecution and scattering and violence."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Get yourself ready, pull in your belt, brace yourself.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Trouble forever.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   He changes it.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Jesus decides, "I'm not going to let it be that way anymore.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I'm going to bring peace for a while upon the church."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And he takes Paul, turns him around and changes everybody's attitude towards the church.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   No more persecution. Strange.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Just keep your antennas up, brothers and sisters.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Jesus is doing things in this world, in Senate court hearings, and in all kinds of movements.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He is doing things you never dreamed he might be doing in your life and in this world.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And today, he's just as alive as he was then.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   You know, it's almost trite to talk about the USSR and the stunning speed with which changes have come about in the Soviet Union.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Used to be Union.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   But now there are independent states.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   There is a claim to democracy.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   There is an openness to Christianity.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Who would have dreamed three years ago?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I just want to scream. I did scream one time.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   In 1988 in Denver.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Some of you have listened to that tape on prayer.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Where I wanted to pull my hair out. I still do when I hear this sort of thing.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Where presumed missions specialists with their bent towards sociological fatalism say,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   "By the year 2000, this number of percentage of countries will be limited access or creative access or hard to reach.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And there will be X number of the people groups outside the realm of the possibility of entering by any kind of normal missionary activity."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I just want to scream and say, "How do you know?"
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   That's why I do scream whenever I say that.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I say, "How do you know that? Come on. Tell me where you get the pride to presume, to predict,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   that 80% of the unreached nations are going to be behind limited access walls by the year 2000."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Jesus reigns. He changes things.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   He turns things around. Read your Bible.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   He is alive. Or are you a practical atheist?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's what I say when I get in the presence of those people.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   What a clip. Wow.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   That was taken from the sermon, "Jesus Still Turns Things Around," which was preached on October 13th, 1991.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And the clip was sent in to us by Kenda Moss in Fairfield, Ohio.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Kenda, thank you for this clip.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You listeners are sending in some really great sermon clips.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Please continue to share those with me so that I can share them with the entire listening audience.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Email us the sermon name.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And if you have it, a timestamp of when and where the clip appears in the audio message.

[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   There's a little button you'll find to send us a question or to send us a clip.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Pastor John returns tomorrow to address whether or not a doctor should help a patient die if the law permits it.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's an interesting conversation happening for Christian physicians right now in Canada.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And one of them wants to hear John Piper on the topic.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   That's tomorrow.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
