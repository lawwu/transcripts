[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.120]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.760]   We have a big week ahead as we come up on Easter.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.420]   And today we're joined again by our friend Ray Ortland,
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.200]   author and senior pastor of Emanuel Church
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Ray, the Ortland family has a long and wonderful history
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.200]   when it comes to fruitful gospel ministry
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.680]   and marriage and parenting.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.120]   Those three categories come to mind
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400]   when I think of the Ortland family legacies.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280]   Gospel ministry, marriage, parenting,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.820]   which is an astonishing legacy to watch from a distance.
[00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.600]   And we talked about marriage earlier in episode number 559,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.560]   and we will talk gospel soon.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.680]   Here I wanna talk about parenting.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.280]   Some people will know your dad,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160]   he was a wonderfully gifted preacher and pastor,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.360]   and his influence on a young John Piper was profound.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.680]   Pastor John shared that story in episode number 172
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.640]   of this podcast series.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.800]   In what ways did your father impact you as a child,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.440]   and in turn, what did you seek to instill
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.880]   in your three sons and daughter when they were young?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.800]   - Well, let me just paint the picture of a moment
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.720]   with my dad that's very dear to me.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.240]   We were in the front yard, I was 10 or 12 years old,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.640]   I forget, and we were, I guess, doing yard work.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.020]   And whatever the context was,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.720]   I can't pull that up in my memory,
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.880]   but he turned to me and he looked me right in the eye,
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.760]   in the middle of our conversation,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.880]   and he said, "You know, bud, before time began,
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.960]   "God chose you."
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.000]   And I think my eyes got real big, you know,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.560]   and I thought, really, in my heart, I thought,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.980]   "Oh, come on, you mean God Almighty in heaven,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.300]   "way back then, thought of little tiny me,
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.080]   "and I felt so loved?
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.240]   "I felt loved by God?"
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.640]   It filled my heart with wonder,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.720]   so that years later,
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.960]   when I heard about the doctrine of election,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.320]   and some of my friends with whom I was dialoguing about that,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.000]   they had difficulty with it, they resisted it,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.440]   I had no problem at all.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.640]   I thought it was wonderful,
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.280]   and it was obviously biblical,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.760]   because my dad had really helped me years before,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.320]   in a moment of theological education
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.060]   that I didn't realize was that.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.480]   He helped me, at level of my heart,
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   to feel the love of God in the doctrine of election.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.880]   But when Jannie and I raised our kids,
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.600]   we just decided, sometimes parents treat parenting
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400]   as if it's some kind of death sentence.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.760]   I mean, we loved it, we decided to love it.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.160]   And, Tony, we just thought through,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.920]   what kind of environment are we going to create
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.760]   for these precious children,
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.080]   as their most formative experience,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.520]   to give them the best start in life?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.320]   And we just had a conviction
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.760]   that the glory of the Lord is ultimate reality.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.480]   I thought of Exodus 33, Moses prayed,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.600]   "Please show me your glory."
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   And the Lord said,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.940]   "I will make all my goodness pass before you."
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.840]   So, ultimate reality is the glorious goodness of God.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.360]   And we just wanted to create a home environment
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.960]   where our children would find that easy to believe.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   We tried to inload joy and sincerity and tenderness
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.840]   and love and wisdom and gentleness and laughter,
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.440]   with discipline and boundaries too,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.200]   because that's part of God's goodness.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.640]   And I don't know how successful we were in that effort,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.040]   but that's what we tried to do,
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.800]   because we just believed that ultimate reality
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360]   is not darkness and despair,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.600]   but just the glorious goodness of God.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.160]   - Well, based on what I see in your kids,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.040]   I think you and Janie pulled this off by grace, of course.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.880]   Thank you, Ray.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.280]   And I mentioned the critical role your dad played
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.520]   in John Piper's life,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.640]   and Pastor John shared that story
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.720]   in episode number 172 in this podcast series.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.600]   The episode is titled,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.680]   "How Do I Motivate My Church for Ministry?"
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.700]   You can find it in the Ask Pastor John archive
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.960]   at desiringgod.org.

[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.560]   Tomorrow, I wanna ask you, Ray, more about church culture,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.800]   and specifically of the toxic dangers
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.000]   that threaten the unity of the church, namely gossip.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.660]   I know you have put a lot of thought into this,
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.440]   and it's a very real issue faced by congregations,
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.280]   and we'll address that tomorrow on the Ask Pastor John
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.120]   podcast.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.960]   Thanks for listening.
