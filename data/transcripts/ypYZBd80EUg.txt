[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100]   So my recent book tour, uh, I didn't have room in my bag.
[00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.080]   So I was packing for two weeks.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.080]   I didn't have room to bring my normal, remarkable digital notebook, but I knew
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.720]   there was a particular idea that I wanted to work on related to a new book that
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.080]   I'm just starting to ideate about.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.800]   So at the last minute, as I was running out the door, I grabbed the fields, note
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.980]   notebook, say a small pocket size notebook that I had lying around the first 10
[00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.400]   pages were already taken up with actually sketches from my kids, but I just grabbed
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.960]   this and I brought it with me to work on and it worked remarkably well.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.520]   I brought it with me in my pocket.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.400]   Almost everywhere I went, I worked on this book idea in bars, at hotel
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.960]   breakfasts, waiting in recording studios to start recording interviews in my hotel
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.040]   room, uh, on the beach in Santa Monica, as well as walking next to Ladyburg Lake in
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.640]   Austin, um, I ended up capturing some really interesting thoughts in here.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.920]   I thought it was very successful.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.340]   So this idea of a small notebook dedicated to a single creative idea, what I'm calling
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.480]   a single purpose notebook is something that's now starting to fascinate me.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.360]   So I want to explore it in today's deep dive.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   What's going on with this idea?
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.160]   Why does it work?
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.400]   Where does it not work and what should you take away?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   So I want to start by noting, I'm not the first to discover this, this idea of having
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.040]   single purpose notebooks that you use to develop particular ideas is quite common.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160]   I have a couple of visuals here for those who are watching.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.940]   So I'm pulling up on the screen right now.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.520]   These are notebooks from Picasso.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.300]   He had these sketchbooks.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.160]   I have one loaded on the screen right now.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.120]   He's doing a, uh, an ink sketches of a workers in the water with some annotation.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.240]   Here's another Picasso sketch page.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.120]   He would bring a Moleskine style notebook, Moleskine being a sort of, it's a brand
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.760]   now, but it was a general type of notebook.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.920]   It was a, especially in Paris was available with an oil skin cover.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.400]   He just had these notebooks with him.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.240]   To develop his artistic ideas, to work through sketches.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   Um, let me try this.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.640]   Let me try that.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.720]   Let me annotate this.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.440]   All right.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.840]   Now he wasn't alone in that.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.120]   Here's another example.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.240]   Bruce Chatwin, the famous British travel writer, actually very dashing.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.920]   So I get a picture of him here, sort of like a dashing adventurous guy.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.080]   I want to read some Bruce Chatwin.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.960]   Um, but he famously carried around these style of notebooks as well.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.000]   I have a picture of one loaded up here.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.960]   Uh, he would get them from a particular notebook store in Paris
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.120]   and he would buy them in bulk.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   And he would bring them on his, his adventure travels and
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.080]   just take notes on the trip.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.160]   And then we convert these into his sort of famed books.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.480]   So we see one of these notebooks here.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.600]   Here's another picture of some, uh, Chatwin style notebooks, or
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.760]   these might be his exact notebook.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.360]   Some of these are in museums you can see.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.360]   So again, you have this idea, this romantic idea of the traveler.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.360]   You know, his first book was on journeys through Patagonia with his
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   small notebook, just working on this one idea, what I am encountering
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.360]   in learning a single purpose notebook.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.600]   Uh, perhaps the most famous example, Miles Finch from the movie
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.840]   Elf, the Will Ferrell movie Elf as portrayed by Peter Dinklage.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.560]   I'm showing here on the screen, he had this famous idea notebook.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.240]   It's right there.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.840]   I, you can kind of see it on the screen.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.160]   Uh, I'll zoom in.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.720]   This was the notebook that was contain all of his ideas for children's book.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.760]   So the Miles Finch character was this, uh, hired gun that you could
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.040]   bring in to write fantastic picture books.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.560]   And so he had this notebook where all of his ideas were.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.400]   I actually found Jesse, an analysis of online from a notebook
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.680]   enthusiasts website, where they actually went through and tried to
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.200]   understand from these still footages, exactly what sort of notebook Peter
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.800]   Dinklage was using in the movie Elf.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.600]   But then again, here's the point though, single purpose.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.280]   It's just ideas for a children's book.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.920]   I have a single purpose for the notebook.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.120]   All right.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.240]   So I didn't discover this idea.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.040]   Um, it's also not the only type of way to take notes.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.400]   Obviously we've, we've talked about this on the show before.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.680]   Uh, it's one of multiple ways to take notes.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.920]   So I'm going to draw some, let's draw these here.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.160]   Throw caution to the wind here.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.560]   All right.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.880]   So we have this way we just talked about, which I'll illustrate on the
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.400]   screen by drawing a sort of field notes style notebook expertly drawn.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.040]   Um, but there's other ways to take notes as well.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.680]   So like an episode 287, I'm just trying to put this single purpose notebook
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.240]   in a larger context of note-taking.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.080]   In episode 287, I talked about how I take notes professionally,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.320]   like the main way I take notes.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.800]   And I'm drawing a laptop here because the, the key idea about how I take
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.440]   notes for articles, books, or academic, academic, uh, research as well, is
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.040]   my whole argument in episode 287 is you really should just go straight
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.720]   to the tool you use to do that work.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.120]   So for books or New Yorker articles, like capture notes in the research
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   folder in a Scrivener project that you're going to eventually use to
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.480]   write that book or write that article for an academic article, go straight
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.560]   to the late tech and mark it up and have it straight in the collaborative
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.600]   document you're going to use to write the paper for various reasons.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.280]   That's what I recommended there.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.000]   There's also this whole other approach, which is popular.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.320]   The sort of Zettelkasten based second brain approach.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.640]   So I'll just kind of draw a brain here where you have a sort of all powerful
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.320]   system that captures all notes on all things.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.960]   And, and if, uh, the Zettelkasten inspired versions of second brain
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.400]   systems, you can also have serendipitous discovery of new ideas
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   from this like collection of notes.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.960]   So there's, there's other dominant ways that people think about taking
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.040]   notes in our current digital world.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.120]   Uh, Jesse, would you say that picture of a brain is something detailed enough
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.040]   that you could do like anatomy studies on?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.200]   I think it's pretty much it's that accurate.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.520]   I've seen you write a brain before.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.920]   And that one is, um, average average.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.840]   You make a better one.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.400]   Yeah, it's not my best brain, not my best brain.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.320]   Um, so we have different approaches for taking notes.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.880]   I want to put this in context, right?
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.080]   And each of these approaches have their own.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.200]   Uh, they have their own context in which they make sense, right?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.400]   So this, my professional note system, I'm going to label it.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.520]   You know, this is good for big projects.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.600]   I'm working on a project.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   I'm writing an article or a paper or a book.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.120]   I'm working on a project.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.240]   I got to have to collect a huge amount of information relevant to this project and
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.960]   then eventually make, uh, make sense of it.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.520]   Professional note-taking is, uh, about organization, right?
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   The actual thinking about this information is going to occur
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.080]   in a very structured way.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.920]   You're going to have like long, deep work blocks put aside
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.480]   for you to work on this project.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.560]   I'm going to go for a long walk to do nothing, but think about how to
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.000]   make sense of all this information.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.360]   So it's note-taking as organizational system.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.520]   The, uh, second brain, you know, I think this approach is, there's
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.600]   two things it's good for.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.120]   One is if you collect a lot of unstructured information, meaning
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.080]   stuff that's interesting, but you don't know what to do with it yet.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.200]   Something like a second brain system could be beneficial because
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.600]   that's, what's really good at like, just put this in here.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.440]   We'll find connections between information.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.400]   Um, so if you're someone who sifts through a lot of information, wants
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   to hold on to a lot of information, maybe wants to serendipitously
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.560]   surface ideas, something like a second brain system makes sense.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.320]   It's also good for people who like that technology.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.000]   Like some people really like building these sort of digital
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.240]   information management systems.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.400]   It's a hobby and it's a cool one.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.720]   So it's good for that.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.200]   So what is the single purpose notebook method we're talking about today?
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.840]   What is it good for?
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.160]   And I'm going to label this creative exploration.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.600]   I'm going to write that right here on the screen.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:01.800]   As an aid for exploring a single idea, that's going to require extended
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.880]   thinking and creative insight to come together.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.640]   This is where I think the single purpose notebook can play a big role.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.040]   So why is this method just having one notebook dedicated to a single
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.040]   thing you're trying to understand better or think about or have creative insight?
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.160]   Why is this method work so well?
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.280]   Well, there's a couple of things you get working with a dedicated notebook.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.200]   One is neuroscientific is focuses your context, your cognitive context.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.120]   Everything in this notebook will be related to the one thing you're
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.080]   trying to develop.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.320]   So when you open this notebook and flip through it and start writing, all
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.680]   your brain associates with this notebook is that one topic you're working on.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.400]   So I was working on a book idea in this notebook.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.680]   That's what my brain associated it with.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.320]   So when I pulled out this notebook, that's what I'm thinking about this
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.680]   project, and I can slip into that cognitive context quicker, meaning I can
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.960]   get insights that are higher quality faster.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.080]   This is different, for example, than pulling out your phone and
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.520]   talking to the notes application.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.440]   Your phone represents all sorts of cognitive context.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.680]   There's email, there's games, there's social media on there.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640]   Your brain starts going all over the place, right?
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.240]   It's the dog salivating when the digital feed bowl is being
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.360]   brought in from the kitchen.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.080]   Same thing when you go into a professional note taking system.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.040]   You know, you associate this with work and all the different
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.160]   types of things you work on.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.800]   It puts you in a work mode, but maybe that's not where you want to be.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.560]   We're trying to develop an idea creatively.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.600]   You're trying to be original.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.400]   Same thing with the second brain system.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.960]   It puts you in this sort of, not just brainstorming mode, but a mode
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.160]   that's associated with everything.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.800]   There's so much unstructured information.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.520]   Single purpose notebook.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.840]   This is for this one thing.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.720]   So it puts your brain into the right mindset for not just capturing
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.800]   thoughts, but developing them.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.680]   It's also extremely low friction.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.720]   So when you're working on a new idea.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   Hey there, I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.080]   Slow productivity, the lost art of accomplishment without burnout.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.800]   really going to like this book.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:14.120]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.360]   instructions for putting it into action.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   So to find out more about the book, check out calnewport.com/slow.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.680]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.080]   All right.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.400]   Thanks.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.200]   Let's get back to it.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.120]   That's non-trivial.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.680]   Serendipity plays a big role.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.120]   I'm walking, I'm in the car and ooh, I just had a flash.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.880]   The friction in getting that idea into this notebook is minimal.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.840]   You take it out of your pocket, you open it, you write.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.800]   Nothing's turned on.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.880]   You're not opening any apps.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.160]   You're not typing with your thumbs.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.760]   And so it's very well suited for exactly the information flow that describes
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.720]   this type of creative development of a focused idea, which has these moments
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.240]   of serendipity and quick capture.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.520]   The third reason why this method works well is ritualistic.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   There's a ritual around it, right?
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.840]   I mean, the shape of the notebook, the associations you have between
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.680]   this and Bruce Chatwin, you know, on an iceberg somewhere in Patagonia,
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.920]   romantically writing his thoughts down.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.840]   It's a ritual of pulling out a notebook, a well-worn notebook that you, you
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.240]   just like the shape and the feel of, and a pen that you really like.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.320]   That ritual also helps puts you in a mindset for, in this case, creative
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:31.680]   exploration in a way that just loading up your laptop does not, or taking
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.320]   out your phone does not, or looking into an interface for unstructured
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.080]   information storage system does not.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.240]   Right.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.920]   There is, it's a ritualistic aspect of this that puts you into that mindset.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.240]   So when you put these three things together, the focus, cognitive
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.840]   context, the ritualistic aspect, the extremely low friction, it becomes
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.360]   a very effective tool for the creative exploration of a single topic.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.880]   Something you deploy for a single topic.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.000]   It works very well for them.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.680]   All right.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:01.760]   So what's the protocol here?
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.600]   Well, if you do creative work as part of your job or your leisure life, things
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.520]   that require extended thought and creative insight, buy a bunch of notebooks.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.400]   Small, like moleskin or even, I like these field note ones even better
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.960]   because it's flexible, very thin.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.360]   So it fits right in your pocket.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.480]   Get a pen you like that writes really well on the paper.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.160]   I still use my Uniball micros 0.3 millimeters, but whatever you like.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.120]   And start bringing them with you to tackle a particular problem.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.480]   This is my notebook for this.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.720]   I want to wrap my mind around this new idea and maybe write an article about it.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.360]   I will carry this notebook with me until I have something smart to say about it.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.440]   I need to figure out a product doesn't feel right.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.480]   A product market fit here is not right.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.240]   I'm going to bring a notebook with me until I feel like I have my arms around it.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.200]   There's something going on.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.440]   This not might be nonprofessional.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.840]   You know, there's something about my life.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.240]   That's not feeling good.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.440]   I it's what's happening in my career.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.320]   I feel this is something non-deep here.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.280]   This is, I don't, I'm not resonating here.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.160]   Something is not right.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.320]   I'm going to bring this notebook with me until I have an idea about what is.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.520]   Right.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.320]   That's the protocol.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.400]   You have a stack of these.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.960]   When a problem comes up that requires extended thought and creative insight,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.080]   you grab one, dedicate it to that.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.680]   And when you're done, you're done with that notebook.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.280]   Don't use it for multiple things.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.520]   Don't say, well, I only use five pages.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.880]   So now I want to use the rest for another problem.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.240]   That's like, no, this notebook is for this idea.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.040]   That's what it is.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.920]   It is a, in the end will be an artifact reflecting my thinking on that particular
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.320]   idea.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:40.680]   It is a, a hack for extracting more creative insight out of the human brain.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:44.840]   We are by far not the first people to think of it, but this idea, which
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.560]   used to be common, I think is being less common in an age of digital tools.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.480]   And a lot of these digital tools just don't serve the same purpose.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:14:00.120]   Picasso on an iPad or Bruce Chatwin, you know, type it into obsidian would not be
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   the same as just having the, the single purpose notebook that you can romantically
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.000]   and creatively just pull out as needed and develop your thoughts.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.480]   So I like this idea.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.200]   I'm gonna do more of it.
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.520]   I'm going to buy a bunch of field notes.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.240]   I'm going to have a stack and I'm just going to grab them.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.800]   Hey, this week I'm using this notebook for this idea one at a time.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.960]   I'm excited about it.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.800]   I've done this off and on before, but I'm excited to have an official
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.440]   protocol here to actually pull from.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.400]   Actually, I was going to ask you about that.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.320]   So if you have multiple things you're thinking about, you'll just kind of think
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.880]   about one per week with that notebook.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.720]   Or I'd have two notebooks in your pocket.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.680]   But maybe I'd only bring, I'd probably just bring one with me at a time, you
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.200]   know, Hey, I'm going to be gone all day doing X.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.000]   This is the idea I'm going to work on.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.400]   So let me pull that notebook with me.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.040]   That's what I would do it.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.000]   I wouldn't have two notebooks with me at the same time.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.440]   I always carry around a notebook to like write down things I forget and I have it
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.040]   in like an old golf holder, but it actually has a slot for like two.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.440]   So I can possibly put another one in there for like an idea for like a separate one.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.800]   I think a capture notebook's another good idea.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.440]   Um, that's a David Allen idea, right?
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   Like you, you want to have something to capture stuff you have to do as soon as
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.320]   you think of it so that it's not just in your head.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.760]   Uh, they're not as common now because most people spend so much of their day near a
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.840]   digital device where they can do that capture that it doesn't come up that
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.120]   often, but if you spend a lot of time away from such a device, I think, I think
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.720]   that's a great idea.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.760]   So you could definitely have two of these things, capture and a idea notebook.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.160]   The other question people often have is when do I read it?
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.240]   And I would say weekly plan, right?
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.360]   So if you're using a single purpose idea notebook, when you do your weekly plan
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.080]   each week, that's a good time to sort of go through this, take stock.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.160]   Where am I that I reached some conclusion that I now want to put into my strategic
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   plan, or do I want to put aside time now to actually like take the ideas and build
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.360]   a plan and start a new project, just confronted every week.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.240]   And it might just be.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   Nope, still working on it.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.200]   Uh, had some ideas, nothing great yet, and there's nothing else to do, but knowing
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.680]   that you will look at these active ideas, single purpose idea notebooks, knowing
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   that you will look at them each week will also give you confidence to let these
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.080]   ideas leave your mind or they will otherwise be a source of stress, like,
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.600]   don't forget, don't forget, don't forget.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.880]   We had this great idea about this book.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.360]   Don't forget.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:17.880]   Don't forget.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.200]   You really need a way to offload that into a notebook that you trust you will
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.520]   check.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.400]   So I would say use your weekly plan as we just checked in on whatever notebooks
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.840]   you were actively using that week.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.120]   And if you're ready to act on it, that's a great time to actually
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.280]   figure out what you're going to do.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.600]   This might be a task goes into your Trello board.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.840]   Time is put aside on your calendar, a project to started, but you really need
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:42.760]   the trust that the notebooks won't be forgotten, that the ones you're using
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.320]   will be checked.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.280]   So I think the weekly scale is probably the right scale.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.680]   And Isaacson book about Da Vinci.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.720]   He had a lot of notebooks.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.760]   Yes.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.080]   And that's all they had back then.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.680]   I mean, I, it's interesting as part of integrating the digital, like we're in
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.400]   this new digital age, we're trying to live deep lives.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.480]   Half of this is I can do halves.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.040]   Let me do thirds.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.240]   Like a third of this is like knowing what not to use.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.800]   Don't get stuck using tech talk all the time.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.120]   A third of it is knowing what to use, right?
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:14.600]   That, okay.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.920]   I need to take advantage of the opportunities that new technologies make
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.360]   possible.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.840]   This is like us with a podcast.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.560]   This didn't exist 15 years ago.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.960]   And now it could be like the cornerstone of me reaching an audience and making a
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.280]   living.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.480]   Um, and then like the other third is like knowing the analog stuff to really
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.120]   embrace the, make sure that the digital isn't completely pushing you around.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.880]   And this is like one of those cases for ideating.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.240]   This is much better than what we're doing.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.600]   Digital.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.360]   So like the intentional use of analog is really critical when you're trying to
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.520]   analyze the digital, we forget the analog when we think about what to do or don't
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.440]   do in the digital, but you know, having the right analog bulwarks against the
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.520]   digital incursion is just as important as just focusing on the incursion itself
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.400]   and trying to pick and choose what you're getting involved with.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.200]   Also, it's cool.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.800]   Bruce Chatwin's a cooler writer than I am.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.520]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.000]   Oh, he probably did it longer than you.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.680]   You're getting there.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   I need to wear a cool leather jacket more often.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.880]   He's going to obsess over quality.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.680]   Wear, wear aviator glasses and like a leather jacket.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.720]   Let's play kids, smoke, smoke, Marlboro reds.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.800]   I think that's, what's going to do it.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.960]   Stay deep, stay deep in my first smoking my cigarette, French accent, a lot of
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.720]   French, a lot of berets.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.320]   All right.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.520]   So there's, uh, we got a lot of questions coming up.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.080]   It's going to be a slow productivity corner takeover.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.000]   Uh, before we get there, let me first mention one of the sponsors
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.120]   that makes your show possible.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:42.840]   Talk about our friends here at cozy earth, cozy earth, uh, their sheets.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.600]   They're best-selling bamboo sheets made from viscous bamboo is probably
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.840]   one of the favorite things I own.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.320]   I 100% love these sheets.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.480]   They originally sent me a set.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.720]   We've bought more because we never wanted to have a time in which the, uh, we did
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.680]   not have cozy earth sheets on our bed.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.040]   They are that comfortable.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.520]   They are that temperature regulating.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.000]   I had never thought about sheets before until we got these and
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.600]   my God, they are fantastic.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.000]   I mean, we have other stuff as well.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.640]   I just got a, uh, shirt, which is great.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.840]   Um, like a crew kind of like sweatshirt crew cut sweatshirt that feels like the
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.160]   sheets and regulates the temperature.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.800]   It's like cold.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.360]   I love that.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.080]   But the sheets, I gotta tell you, I have never thought about sheets and now it's
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.680]   like the bane of my existence because when I travel, I'm like, these aren't
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.840]   cozy earth sheets and they're really good.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.920]   Um, they come with a a hundred night sleep trial, which means you have up to
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.840]   a hundred nights to sleep on them, wash them, try them out.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.840]   If you're not completely in love, you can return them for a full refund.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.360]   They also have a 10 year warranty.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.440]   It's a great gift.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.360]   If you already have cozy earth sheets, give it as a gift, the spread, the love.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.600]   Um, but man, I'll tell you the secret about him.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.320]   Jesse is every time you wash them more comfortable.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.280]   Yeah, they are fantastic.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.520]   So if you've never tried cozy earth, I've got awesome news.

[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.440]   Also want to talk about our friends at notion.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:26.400]   If you have to manage information in your business or your job,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.080]   notion is the tool to use.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.640]   It allows you to combine your notes, your documents, and your projects
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.600]   altogether in one beautiful space.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   From just simple management of your ideas to complicated collaborative
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.160]   workflow systems of the type I talk about in my book, a world without email.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.120]   Notion is how you build smart tools and access to your information.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.240]   So, you know, that we've talked about notion, a lot of deep
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.600]   question users use notion.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.560]   We've used notion with our ad agency to keep track of our ads.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.360]   Fantastic tool.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.440]   They have this new feature I want to mention though, which is Q and A and AI
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.720]   assistant that can answer questions about your information in your notion setup.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.440]   Talking questions about next quarter's roadmap, uh, finding the marketing
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.280]   campaign proposal you're working for, digging up a long lost link.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.040]   So as your notion systems get fuller of more and more information,
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.520]   notion Q and A's AI assistant makes it easier to find what you need.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.360]   It's a really cool tool and answers any question you have making use of your
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.400]   entire database of knowledge to make sure your answers are actually helpful.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:45.120]   So try notion AI for free when you go to notion.com/cow, that's all lowercase

[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.120]   All right, let's, uh, move on to some questions.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.880]   Now, my temptation and Jesse, you, you talked me out of this was that we should
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.360]   play the slow productivity theme song the entire time because every question in
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.560]   today's Q and a is slow productivity themed.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   All right.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.280]   You talked me out of it, but can we at least get the theme song at the beginning
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.400]   of our, our Q and a segment for today?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.120]   For sure.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.000]   All right, here we go.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.160]   All right.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.080]   Every question today will be slow productivity themed.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.200]   All right, Jesse, what's our first one?
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.960]   First question is from Sam.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.040]   You define pseudo productivity as the use of visible activity as the
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.560]   primary means of approximating actual productive effort with this being so
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.120]   common.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.040]   What are your thoughts on how all these knowledge work businesses are still
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.000]   profitable with all these workers kind of pretending to work?
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.480]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   I mean, this is the key argument of part one of my book is that what happened in
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:06.840]   knowledge work is it emerges as a major economic sector in the mid 20th century.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.080]   They have this problem of how do we measure productivity in the industrial
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.200]   sector was quantitative products produced per input hour.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.520]   The agricultural sector was quantitative.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.960]   How much bushels of crop that we produce per acre of land and the cultivation
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.400]   that ratio quantitative ratio approach did not apply to knowledge work because
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.520]   now there's not a single thing you're producing.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.280]   Individuals produce many different things and those sets are dynamic and often
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.000]   incomparable.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.680]   What I'm working on is different than what you're working on and the systems by
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.240]   which I'm organizing to manage my work are internals.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.720]   There's no clear or consistent workflow system that you can even optimize to see
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.360]   its impact.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.280]   So, so we couldn't use traditional productivity.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.680]   So what do we do instead?
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.640]   We fell back on this rough heuristic pseudo productivity, which says we will
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.880]   use visible activity as a crude proxy for useful effort.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.000]   So I just going to, let's, let's all gather in the same office.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.440]   I want to see you working work while you're here and at least something useful
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.080]   will be getting done.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.240]   All right.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:14.640]   And this worked okay until we got the front office, it revolution until we got
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.080]   networks and mobile computing.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.480]   And then suddenly pseudo productivity plus the ability to demonstrate fine tune
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.840]   work on your phone or laptop at any moment, that was a, a toxic combination
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.160]   that sparked the burnout crisis that we're all facing now.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:27.400]   All right.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.160]   So that's the whole setup.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.320]   Sam is saying, well, pseudo productivity is such a crude heuristic.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.920]   Um, how are companies still surviving?
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.800]   Well, there's a couple, there's a couple answers here.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.640]   One is this notion of managerial capitalism.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.680]   It's a notion that I really came to understand from Alfred Chandler's, uh,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.800]   Pulitzer prize winning book, the visible hand, where he looks at the rise of large
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.880]   companies with managers, which is newer than we think huge companies with managers
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.400]   is not something that was really widespread until the 20th century.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.000]   And one of the things that Chandler argues in this book is that once you
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.960]   have a manager based company, a large company that does different things
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.760]   managed by managers, as opposed to a smaller shop, just sort of run by the
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.440]   owner, you begin to get a separation between how it internally
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.560]   operates and market signals.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:25.440]   So the managers inside these companies, uh, they optimize for things different
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.280]   than just what's going to produce the highest value overall, they optimize
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.320]   for things like stability.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.040]   They optimize for things like risk reduction.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.840]   They optimize for things like convenience or efficiency or flexibility
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.320]   in, in sort of how they run their own jobs, how they manage their employees.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.080]   Cause that's their incentive.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.320]   It's not some vague bottom line that has a complicated dynamic connection between
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.720]   what their individual employees are doing and how much money the company makes.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.000]   Their incentive is like, I want to keep this job stable and understandable.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And I keep my arms around it.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.360]   So managerial capitalism, I believe is what helps keep things like pseudo
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:04.400]   productivity and it's sort of, uh, terrifying stepchildren, like the
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.680]   hyperactive hive mind, email workflow, the zoom all day, remote work, uh,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.560]   strategies like the things that would, that seems so absurd and
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   terrible and distracting today.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.600]   They can survive because they're also simple.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.360]   They're stable.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.240]   It's, uh, easy to deploy.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.440]   You're not going to rock any boats by saying everyone should have an email
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.800]   address.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.640]   We all have a shared calendar.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.480]   Let's just rock and roll.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.160]   Right?
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.440]   So you can have, uh, operations within knowledge work companies, especially
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.080]   large ones that are somewhat insulated from market signals.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:41.200]   The second reason is in these complicated knowledge work organizations, most people
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.000]   are not directly connected to the bottom line in the same way that you might have.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.680]   If it's just, here's an assembly line.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.880]   And if like one person on the model T assembly line is really slow, it directly
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.520]   affects the number of model T's we're producing.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.040]   Like you're really slow putting steering wheels on, and it's really slowing down
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.840]   the rate at which model teas are produced.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.720]   Knowledge work is not like that.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:08.360]   In fact, in a lot of knowledge work, what you find is a small number of people
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:15.880]   actually producing the bulk of the cognitive capital on which the money
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.920]   itself is actually made.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.120]   Right?
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.120]   So, so in the book, I would call this like the Anthony Zucker effect from a story I
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.800]   tell in part one of the book about CBS, the television network, um, how they
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.480]   turned around their fortunes in the late nineties, early two thousands.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:30.720]   Right?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.200]   So the story talks about how they were in third place among the major networks.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.840]   They hire Les Moonves.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.240]   You got to turn this ship around and Les Moonves turns up.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.840]   He's a pseudo productivity guy.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.040]   Uh, and he says, here's the problem.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   I am here at like three o'clock on a Friday and the offices are half empty.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.280]   We need more visible activity.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.560]   And he sends out this memo at ABC, you better believe they're probably still in
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.560]   their offices at three o'clock on a Friday at, uh, NBC, you better believe
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.120]   they're, you know, in their offices at three o'clock on a Friday.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.640]   You better be as well.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.240]   Like that was his approach to turning around their fortunes.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   And within a few years they were number one.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.200]   But the argument I make is they, they were not number one because, uh, Zucker
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.720]   told the employees at television city to spend more hours in the office.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.920]   Um, I mean, Moonves, they were number one because of this eccentric showrunner,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:27.480]   Anthony Zucker, who came up with the idea for CSI and CSI plus, uh, Mark Burnett,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.520]   this crazy Australian producer who came to them with an idea for a show called
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.960]   survivor, those two ideas turned around the whole, the whole, uh, network, huge
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.920]   ratings hits pushed them up to number one.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.000]   So the reality here is, okay.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.520]   The, the core cognitive capital on which the ultimate success of CBS
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.320]   depended was like the brains of two people.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.960]   Those shows executed well, produced hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.320]   value, everyone else was sort of involved with just the logistics of how you
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.760]   actually, since some sense gather that money, you know, we have to, we have to
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.280]   keep the budgets of the shows running and the advertiser service and have to make
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.640]   sure that the memo here goes there.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.000]   Right.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.320]   So it's, it's a, a lot of what happens in knowledge, work as support and
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.280]   administrative, even if it's not directly an administrative role, you're like, no,
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.000]   I'm the assistant sales of West coast, you know, marketing directing, but the
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.280]   marketing itself, the ad sales, this is all sort of supporting the core
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:23.200]   capitalization, the knowledge work equivalent of the model T that's
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.480]   actually being sold in the end.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.240]   So you have these huge asymmetries and knowledge work as well.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:33.000]   The small number of 10 X minds are producing the actual proverbial model T
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.920]   and everything else is, is around servicing, you know, um, making sure that
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.160]   then you're competently putting that thing to market and harvesting the
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.600]   money that comes back in extend.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.560]   So that also weakens the connection between how you're working
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.840]   and the ultimate bottom line.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:52.440]   Like it doesn't super matter if the West coast ad team at CBS is super
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.800]   efficient in the ultimate question of, are they number one in the ratings?
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.720]   It could be annoying if they're really inefficient, but if they're efficient
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.320]   enough, which you can get with pseudo productivity, it's like,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.080]   you're not a problem.
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.600]   That's fine.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   So I think those are two of the reasons why this, uh, this, uh, non-optimal
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.880]   way of work has persistent knowledge.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.680]   Work is complicated.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.080]   That's like the theme of my, almost a decade now I've spent studying digital
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.240]   age.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.280]   Knowledge work is knowledge work as a complicated system.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.040]   Um, we underestimate how complicated it is.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.320]   We look for simple stories, but it's a complicated system.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.360]   All right.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.080]   Who do we have next?
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.880]   All right.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.840]   Next question is from Carol.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.920]   Can you please elaborate on the connection between limit missions, limit
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.440]   projects, and limit daily goals from your new book specifically for limit daily
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.840]   goals?
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   How do you determine what to focus on each day?
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.160]   Do you only work on a specific project each day?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:53.520]   So this comes from, uh, part two of the book in the chapter dedicated to the
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.040]   principle, do fewer things.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.360]   And one of the propositions in that chapter.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.960]   So I have these things called propositions, which each has a, an idea related to
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.520]   the principle that I then discuss all sorts of concrete tactics for putting into
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:06.880]   action.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.080]   And so one of these propositions is about limit what you work on.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:15.240]   And, uh, I get more specific about that and said, think about your work at three
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:15.840]   scales.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.960]   So you have at the high scale, your mission, like what, what's the thing I'm
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.640]   trying to do?
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.000]   I'm Lin-Manuel Miranda.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.040]   I want to be a celebrated playwright, you know, on the West coast, ad
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.440]   director for CBS.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.800]   I want to have, you know, the highest ad rate sales of, uh, each of the regions.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.480]   I've trying to whatever, make a modernized shop here.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.280]   You have missions at the top that then leads the projects.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.520]   Okay.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.960]   Here's the specific projects I'm working on now that advance my mission.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.240]   And then the underneath the projects, you have daily goals.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.520]   Here's what I'm doing today.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.600]   That is advancing the projects, which themselves are advancing my higher level
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:55.880]   mission.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.680]   So we have these three levels.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.280]   And what I argue is, um, you want to limit each of these levels.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:06.040]   Now the problem is, and this was the point of this section of the book.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:11.200]   The problem is when we feel like we're too crowded, we want to solve overload.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.440]   We tend to focus only at the bottom level.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.480]   We say I'm working on too much each day.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.800]   So let me just cut back and work on fewer things each day.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.520]   I'm too busy.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.920]   I need more breathing room.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.480]   I need more time in my schedule.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.760]   But the problem I point out is that that will prove difficult if you don't also
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.080]   limit the levels above.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.560]   So if you have a ton of ongoing projects, it's very difficult to limit how many
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.200]   goals you're making progress on each day, because you have all these projects that
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.200]   you need to make progress on.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.480]   I have six things I'm doing these six big projects.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.560]   And if I only work on one per day, that's too slow because then I'm, I'm only, I'm
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.200]   not even touching on every project each week.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.000]   Of course I have to work on multiple ones each day.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.280]   So you have to reduce your projects before you can reduce your daily goals.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.400]   But if you have a ton of missions, like here's my four things I'm trying to do.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.200]   Well, any mission is going to have at least some projects going on if
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.120]   it's really one of your missions.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.720]   And so if you have too many missions, you'll have a hard
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:04.800]   time limiting your project.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.920]   So I see you have to start at the top, focus your missions down to like, this
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.520]   is the one or two things I'm trying to do.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.840]   That'll then allow you to reduce the number of active projects you're working
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.800]   on because there's less missions to service and with fewer projects.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.680]   Now you can be more selective each day and not be running around.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.520]   So phonetically, so Carol, when it comes to, you're asking about limiting daily
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.080]   goals, make sure that's the final thing you do, start with the mission,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.280]   then reduce the projects.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.120]   How do you know you've done enough that when you then say, I'm only going to
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.360]   work on one major goal per day, that's not hard.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.920]   You don't say, oh man, this is not going to work.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.760]   That's how you know, you've limited things enough.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.040]   How do you choose which daily goal to work on?
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.960]   Your weekly plan will help this, right?
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.480]   Cause where are these projects?
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.720]   Where are these missions captured in your, your semester or
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.680]   strategic or quarterly plan, whatever you want to call it.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.600]   So when you do your weekly plan and you review that, like, what am I
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.800]   going to make progress on this week?
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.920]   Like these two things.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.560]   All right.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.440]   So maybe the first half of the week, I'll work on this.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.640]   The second half I'll work on that.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.760]   So you can kind of figure this out during your weekly plan.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.080]   When you're able to take in the whole landscape of the week ahead of you and
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.240]   your big picture vision for the current, the current quarter and beyond that,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.160]   don't sweat it too much, right?
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   There's no perfect choice.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.960]   Like this is the exact right project to work on.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.560]   You just want to be making progress on one serious thing per day.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.160]   So what then happens with the rest of your day?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.720]   Well, that's all the administrative overhead stuff, right?
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.760]   So you make one deep progress on one thing is pretty good.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.080]   The rest of your day is going to be meetings and emails and talking about
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.720]   projects that are going to generate daily goals in the future, but like one
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.320]   substantial deep work per day is good.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.200]   Sometimes maybe two, and you should be happy with that.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.120]   If you're not happy with that, you need to move up the chain of
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.640]   limiting because all these things connect together.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.120]   So yeah, that's a cool part in the book.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.920]   Um, so Carol, thanks for asking that question.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.320]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.960]   I have Thomas in slow productivity, you discussed your $50 notebook
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.440]   and how it provided inspiration.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.760]   Can you elaborate on investing in tools and how that can help,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.240]   but also be taken too far?
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.120]   I found that notebook too.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.520]   I should have brought that in my $50 lab notebook.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:13.080]   I talked about it in some, one of the mini podcast interviews
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:13.640]   they did recently.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.400]   We got into it.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.920]   I can't remember who it was now though.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.280]   I've been doing too many of these, Jesse.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.560]   Yeah, I was reading the book.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.080]   I, yeah, I will bring it in.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.920]   So for people who don't know, I talk about how at MIT during my
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.000]   postdoc, I bought a lab notebook.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.640]   Uh, lab notebooks are very expensive because, uh, maybe I
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.680]   talked about this with Adam Grant.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.600]   Well, whatever.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.520]   Um, lab notebooks are very expensive because they're archival, right?
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.440]   So for like patent disputes, et cetera.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.880]   Um, this is how you, you, uh, record.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.480]   This was the day when I had this idea, right?
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.280]   So like you end up inventing the telephone.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   You have your lab notebook will actually be how you establish priority.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.080]   So it's, um, very, that's thick paper.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.200]   They're all stamped with numbers, uniquely stamped, very thick covers.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.400]   Cause these are meant to be stored for potentially decades,
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.000]   really good spiral binding.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.160]   They're very high quality notebooks.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.600]   And so I had this experiment at MIT where I bought one of those.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.920]   And I think it was $50.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.920]   It might've been $70.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.920]   I don't remember, but I bought one because my thought was I'm going
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.680]   to take this notebook more seriously.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.480]   So when I'm working on proofs, um, I'm going to, it's going to make me
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.720]   be more careful because I don't want to just scribble in something
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.680]   that costs so much money.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.000]   And in the book, I talk about how I went back recently and I went through
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.520]   that $50 notebook and counted up every idea in that notebook that either
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:36.360]   became a peer reviewed published paper or an NSF grant, and it was a really big
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.720]   number, I forgot exactly what it was.
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.160]   I think it was like seven or eight different papers and grants
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.760]   came out of this one notebook.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.360]   And it's all very, all my handwriting is very uncharacteristically
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.080]   neat and the diagrams are careful.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:52.160]   So the idea here, the bigger idea is when it comes to the most important
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.800]   thing you do, if you're a knowledge worker, so the, the, the most value
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.360]   producing skilled cognitive labor that you do invest in your tools, spend
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:08.000]   money on your tools because this signals to yourself, I take this really seriously.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.480]   And then your mind is like, this is for real.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.280]   Let's go, let's rock and roll.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.800]   Like we're doing something really serious here, right?
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.480]   It's like a radio people.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.600]   I used to hear radio.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.080]   People had a hard time at first when they shifted to the podcast format, even when
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:28.280]   they were getting bigger audiences on their podcast, because when they were
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:34.120]   doing radio, it was a much more expensive studio setup and here's the soundproof
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.200]   room and the engineer and the big soundboard and the, just the seriousness
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.880]   of the context made it seem like a more serious endeavor than when they just
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.840]   had, you know, an SM seven in their attic.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.960]   It's the tools can really matter.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.280]   So this means, for example, don't use free software, pay for the full
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.440]   version of whatever you're using, get the best tool.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.240]   If you're, if, if screenwriting is what you do, you should have the final,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.840]   whatever the, what are they called?
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.280]   What do they use?
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.000]   Final draft?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.400]   I don't know what the big screenwriting software is.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.680]   Uh, final cut.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.880]   It's final cut.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.360]   Isn't that editing?
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.320]   It's like an editing.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.920]   Well, whatever, you know, like have the good software, right?
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.200]   Use Scrivener if you're doing nonfiction or novel writing, like, and pay for it.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.800]   You know, uh, if you're a scientist, have a really good late, you know, late
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.960]   tech or editor, like markup editor that you use really good notebooks.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.280]   If you're podcasting, once your audience starts to grow, get a really good, you
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.920]   invest that money back into your sound equipment to make it better.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.960]   Um, it's psychological as much as it is practical.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:41.920]   So Thomas is asking, you know, how do you know if you're taking this too far?
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.360]   Um, invest in port.
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.440]   I was going to say, invest in proportion to the value you're creating,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.160]   but I actually want to edit that.
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.800]   Invest in proportion to the value you could credibly be
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.680]   creating in the near future.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.720]   Right.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.080]   So, uh, I want it, for example, if I was just starting a podcast by a $700
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.080]   microphone, cause you're like, I'm probably not going to be generating, you
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.440]   know, enough value, enough ad revenue, et cetera, to really justify that yet.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:18.240]   But maybe I will buy, uh, the new sure product that has the built in D to A
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.280]   converter, the thing I use, you know, when I'm on the road, it's like 130 bucks.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.240]   And like, I don't know, I think the audience I might grow over the next six
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.280]   months is big enough that it's like worth having spent, you know, 150 bucks
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.560]   on the mic and 50 bucks on good headphones.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.640]   And because it signals I'm taking this seriously, but it's kind of in
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:38.320]   proportion to what I'm doing, but I'm not going to spend $2,000 a month on a
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.240]   studio lease and have a, you know, $5,000 worth of equipment yet.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.800]   Now, on the other hand, if your show is starting to produce a thousand dollars a
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.400]   month, $500 a month in ad revenue, you're like, this is in proportion, actually,
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.360]   let me like make this investment to be six months worth of the ad revenue.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.920]   That's in proportion to what I'm doing.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:56.600]   So you want to keep it.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.440]   The investment in the proportion to the value you are creating or conceivably
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.280]   will be creating in the near future.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   And it's not always a clear cut number.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   Of course, you could be working for a large organization, um, investing in a
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.000]   new tool.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.800]   You might not have a specific revenue number.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.840]   They say you generate it, but you're like this, this thing I'm doing in this
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.160]   company is really important.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.400]   And it's moving my, my stock, my proverbial stock higher in this company.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.760]   So I'm going to invest in getting a better version of this tool.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.920]   I'm going to get a better, whatever it is.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.200]   Right.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.920]   Um, so yeah, you don't want to just go crazy.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.160]   What's the most expensive thing I can get, but you also don't want to go free.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.960]   So stay in proportion, whatever that means to you with the value you could
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.360]   credibly be creating now or in the near future.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:44.800]   I think office space is a tool, you know, like having.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:50.400]   A studio for podcasting, but also if you're a knowledge worker, like you're a
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.920]   writer or something like this, and, and you're, you know, you're doing well at
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.440]   it, like investing in, I have a place to go to write.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   I think that's like investing in a tool that makes sense.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.960]   You and humor, man.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.840]   We're talking about that a lot on your podcast where you were mentioning
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.400]   like you're working writing space.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.640]   And yeah, he was asking a lot of questions about that.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:08.800]   He loves the details.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.080]   Right.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.960]   And I was saying like, this is a, a reasonable, if you can afford it, it's
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.760]   a reasonable investment and afford it means, I mean, I sometimes
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.400]   use the 5% number, like if you're a, especially if you're a creative, like
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.960]   you, all you do is creatively produce stuff that is then sold for money.
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:28.360]   You should be in reinvesting 5% at least of your take home pay
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.680]   and your tools and context.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.160]   You know, like, uh, when I see someone who has like a pretty successful
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.080]   podcast or they're, they're a successful writer and they're still like
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.520]   working in difficult circumstances, I was like, no, this is part of the
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.960]   business of what you're doing.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.040]   Yes, it's true.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.800]   You can, you can, in theory, do all of your writing at the kitchen table or
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.400]   do your podcasting in the closet.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.600]   It's fine.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.640]   Right.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.080]   And you're just, I watched one every dollar to come, but you have to think
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.200]   the spend money to make money type of mentality, don't take five to 10% of
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.680]   what you're earning and say, how can I use this to make my situation, my
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.840]   tools and situations better.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.680]   If a lot of people did that, they would have coworking spaces.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.720]   They would have, you know, I write here, not just here.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.880]   I have better tools.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.720]   I'm going to, um, podcasts.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.760]   I'm going to rent the studio for my podcast each week at four, as
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.760]   opposed to doing it in my house.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.480]   Like it, it, it, it will lead you ultimately to producing better stuff and
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   also just enjoying the process of doing it better.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.680]   So maybe that's another rule, five to 10% of your take-home income.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:35.040]   Uh, if you're a high level, creative producer should be reinvested in all the
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.000]   tools and context you use to produce that work.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.080]   I think Brandon Sanderson followed that rule, right?
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.120]   Because he makes a lot of money.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.920]   His books are very successful and he built the underground layer
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.720]   that we've talked about.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:49.000]   Like the hidden underground Victorian Gothic layer where he goes to write.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.120]   Might've been more than 5%.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.680]   Well, it depends.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.160]   I don't know, man.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.520]   I think he might be making millions.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.880]   I mean, how much do you think it would cost to make, it was completely
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.320]   underground, it's gotta be expensive, right?
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.240]   Uh, and it's completely look like custom furnished with woodwork.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.720]   You think a million, I was going to say like half a million dollars.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.800]   I was going to say 300 K at first, depending on where it was.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.440]   But then when you said those numbers, maybe a little bit more than 300.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.800]   Yes.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.400]   I mean like how it was in New York.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.440]   So that's probably more than 5%.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.840]   I'm trying to think about that.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.680]   If you spent $500,000, I don't think it makes $10 million a year.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.000]   All right.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.680]   So he's spending a little bit more, but you know, he might make.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:28.760]   The other thing that you got me thinking of was, um, in last week's episode or
[00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.600]   last week's episode, you were talking about how much money Jewel had because
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.880]   their mom was stole $200 million from her.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.920]   That popped in my mind.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.080]   I hope she has an awesome workspace.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.120]   She followed this rule.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.960]   All right.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.600]   Who do we got next?
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.320]   Next question is from Sula.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   I've been reading your new book, slow productivity.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.680]   I also read something about mental models and first principles.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.040]   I think I heard you mentioned these concepts before.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.920]   How does slow productivity relate to these concepts?
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.560]   Well, Sula, you can think about it both in terms of a new mental model.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.440]   You can also think about it in terms of a collection of new first principles.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.120]   So mental model for those who don't know, at least the way I use the term is a
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.080]   cognitive structure you use for understanding a concept.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.400]   So when you shift your mental models, it can give you a whole new understanding.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.600]   Of how some part of the world or your life actually works, which can completely
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.880]   change the way you approach it principles or first principles I think of as core
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:31.520]   ideas that are generative from these ideas, you can generate new decisions
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:32.880]   about what to do and what not to do.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.600]   So it's, it's a core principle from which I can then derive action.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.520]   I should stop doing this.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.320]   I should do more of that.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.960]   So you use it to judge or evaluate potential actions.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.320]   So I think of that as like a generative idea.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.240]   I sometimes call those.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:51.120]   So the mental model shift embedded in slow productivity is this
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.800]   idea that pseudo productivity.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.440]   The thing that we have been implicitly referring to when we talk about being
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.040]   productive and knowledge work, it's not actually that productive.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.600]   If we really mean by productive production of stuff that matters, right.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.320]   That's a big mental model shift.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.120]   The prior mental model shift, I think the mental model we have for knowledge
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.880]   work is we try to, without realizing it, adapt the industrial agricultural
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.080]   ideas of productivity to knowledge work, even though they don't fit.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.240]   Now, remember the agricultural and industrial notions of productivity
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.080]   are all about output per input.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:33.000]   So to be more productive is to more efficiently transform inputs in the
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.840]   outputs, the assembly line increase the model T's per labor hour by a factor
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.880]   of 10, for example.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.880]   So then when we thought about being productive and knowledge work, we had
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.240]   this model of trying to squeeze more model T's out, which meant that in an
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.480]   assembly lines, more efficient way of putting together a model T.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.360]   So it was a mental model of productivity based on efficiency and speed.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:58.640]   It's why when we, we, we hear, you know, critiques of hustle culture
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:02.040]   for magazine writers, they're always talking about Frederick Winslow
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.880]   Taylor, the creator of scientific management, which is the, the
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.800]   epitome of industrial productivity.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.520]   How do we get the, the movements that are producing the thing that
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.480]   this foundry or factory produces as efficient as possible.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.040]   And so we just assume, well, that's what productivity is.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.360]   And so if we say, I want to be productive and knowledge work, it's
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.480]   about efficiency and optimization and hacks and all these types of things.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.720]   But it's not really right.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.160]   So my book, Slow Productivity shifts the mental model.
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.880]   That's not actually what we've been doing because we don't have,
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.480]   we, we, we can't bring Frederick Winslow Taylor into a knowledge work office.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.600]   What is he measuring with his stopwatch?
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.960]   How fast you type when you answer emails, you know, like how you
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.560]   put stuff on your calendar, there's no clear thing you're doing.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.160]   And so this mental model shifts is like, no, what we were, what we've been
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.000]   doing instead of pseudo productivity, which is just activity, you just need
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.880]   to demonstrate that you're here and doing things, which in the model world
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.200]   means sending emails, replying to Slack, jumping on calls and going to meetings.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.440]   This is how, what we mean by productivity is it has very little to do with like
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.160]   efficiency or, um, squeezing, increasing the speed at which we do things.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   And it has, it's not good, right?
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.040]   So that's the mental model shift.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.600]   We're not doing Winslow Taylor.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.720]   We're doing pseudo productivity.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.520]   Pseudo productivity doesn't actually produce a lot of valuable
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.560]   stuff in the end anyways.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:21.680]   Actually a slower approach to work with more careful workload management
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.800]   and variation and a real care for quality that'll produce in the
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.200]   end, more stuff that matters.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.600]   That'll push CBS from number three to number one.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.680]   Not how active we are.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.120]   So that's the key mental model shift.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.800]   What are the key first principles for achieving that shift?
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.440]   Well, that's my three principles of slow productivity, do fewer things, work
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.320]   at a natural pace, obsess over quality.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.480]   These are generative first principles.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.400]   Uh, I introduced the concepts in the chapter dedicated to each.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:56.320]   And then from that principle, we, we moved to a wide variety of practical advice.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.600]   So they're generative principles from which actionable specific ideas,
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.560]   suggestions, and filters can be derived.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.320]   It's a good terminology.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.240]   So I appreciated that.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   It's a good way of trying to capture what's new and what's
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.480]   interesting about this concept.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.280]   All right.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.840]   Um, let's do one more question here.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.000]   This looks like a long one.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.240]   Yeah, go.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.480]   All right.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.200]   What do we got next questions from Peter?
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.120]   I'm wondering if you have any tips on how to approach
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.680]   reading and applying the lessons.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.280]   I know the temptation will be to devour it like Cerberus on a bacon flavored
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.400]   Twinkie while furiously taking notes in hopes of sifting through
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.960]   and acting on all of it someday.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.600]   However, I have sometimes had more success when I limit myself to one
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.800]   chapter per week, which allows me to slow down and make sure I understood
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.600]   and applied the information to each chapter before moving on.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.640]   Do you think that the information in slow productivity needs to be
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.720]   understood and applied in order?
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.440]   Which is presented or would it work to read the whole thing and then go
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.280]   back and try to piece it together?
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.640]   That's a good question.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.920]   Peter, good Greek mythology reference.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.640]   That's like old school, old school, deep questions.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.360]   I appreciate that.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.040]   Um, all right.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.160]   So here's how I would recommend reading slow productivity.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.840]   There's part one, part two.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.720]   Part one is the, this whole concept of pseudo productivity.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.560]   How do we get here?
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:12.360]   What's the real problem?
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.880]   The mental model shift part two, here's the three principles.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.640]   Let's explain each and break them down in the concrete action.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:22.680]   I would read both parts all the way through first.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.560]   Uh, don't, I don't particularly care on the speed, but I would
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.440]   read the whole thing first.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   Why the principles relate to each other.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.480]   Like when we get the principle three obsess over quality, I sort of end up
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.160]   revealing, this is actually the glue that holds the first two together.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:42.200]   And like, without this, the first two are not going to do well in isolation.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.480]   So I would just read the whole thing, completely shift your mental model.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.320]   And then you can go back through more carefully and say, okay,
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.560]   so where do I want to start?
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.800]   And you actually might start with principle three and you might go back to that.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.480]   Let me, let me go back to it this week and look through the advice and
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   like, where do I want to start?
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.640]   What do I want to actually try here?
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.240]   And, and maybe get that going for a few weeks and then say, okay, now
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.960]   I'm going to work on the workload, the doing fewer things.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.160]   Now I'm going to go back to that chapter.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.840]   Let me give it a few weeks to experiment with it.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.480]   So I would read the whole thing.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.240]   And then I would go through principle by principle in the order that
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:15.600]   makes most sense to what resonates with you.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.560]   And you could spend a month per principle, really, because
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:19.680]   a lot of it's experimental.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.480]   Let me try this.
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.360]   Let me get some feedback.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:22.360]   Let me adjust this.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.200]   You're sort of experimenting with each of these principles.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.560]   Once you've done that for all three, it's now we're like three months
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.680]   out from you first getting the book.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.440]   That's when you're going to start to feel the synergy.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.320]   Oh, this stuff's starting to click.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:39.280]   Like my obsession over quality is helping me do fewer things.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.600]   And the natural pace now feels inevitable as opposed to contrived you.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.760]   And everything starts to work together.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.880]   And you're going to begin to get that that feeling of relief,
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.400]   that slow productivity advantage.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.080]   So that's a good question, Peter.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.000]   That's how I would do it.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.120]   All right.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.040]   We have a call.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.560]   Yeah. All right. Let's hear that. OK.
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:04.400]   Hi, Cal, this is Kyle.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.320]   I run a large nonprofit mindfulness center, and I've been a big fan
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.600]   of your work for many years.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   I've read all your books, listened to all your podcasts
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.000]   and use your principles in classes, workshops and executive coaching.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.320]   So thank you so much for putting so much good content out into the world.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.280]   I love your ideas.
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.760]   But as a busy CEO, a father of several kids and a mere mortal,
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.080]   I struggle to implement them consistently.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.600]   And I find myself intimidated by the degree to which you seem to have
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.000]   everything so perfectly dialed in in your life and your seven jobs.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.440]   One of my favorite moments in your podcast was an episode
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.400]   when you admitted how long it takes you to get ready for evening events
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.840]   compared to your wife, Julie.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:44.480]   It was such a wonderful humanizing moment to learn that for all his erudition
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.320]   and success, Cal Newport may have areas of his own life
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.920]   that stubbornly resist submitting to his systems.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:53.880]   So my question is whether you might be able to share any stories
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:57.640]   about the pain and failure points in your life where you really struggle
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:01.400]   to implement your best practices, maybe where you feel like a hypocrite,
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.640]   where you fall down and have to keep trying.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.000]   It would be such a relief to know that even you can't perfectly
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.400]   engineer things or execute your plans as well as you'd like.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.560]   Thanks so much.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.800]   There's nothing I can say, I'm perfect.
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.800]   All right, so what do we got next?
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.520]   That's a good it's a good question.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.400]   I think people often get me backwards.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.200]   So they think like I have all of these
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.640]   perfected systems and this goes back to our mental model discussion
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:34.760]   that I have these like perfected systems that like optimize what I produce.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.920]   It is the exact opposite.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:43.200]   The philosophies I deploy in my life are trying to deal with.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:48.360]   All of the sort of imperfections and stubborn
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.080]   inefficiencies that are intrinsic to me as a person, so I'm not just
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.400]   slow to get ready, though, that's definitely a big thing.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:59.000]   I don't I'm not fast with stuff.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.080]   I really deal poorly with having a lot to do like a crowded calendar day.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.600]   I talked about this some on Andrew Huberman's podcast
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:12.680]   that in grad school, I developed this acute insomnia that would episodic.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.240]   It would come and go right.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.360]   And it was a real it really shook me up because it was, oh, I don't control this.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.400]   So like something else can just come in and like take away
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.000]   my ability to, you know, do work.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.800]   So I'll just be like really tired or something like this.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.600]   And a lot of my ideas and strategies, for example, a case in point
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.120]   is dealing with that reality.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.440]   Like a lot of my my slow productivity approach, it was was dealing
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.600]   with this idea of, well, I can't be someone that just gets after it every day,
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.640]   because what if I'm really tired or I'm not sleeping?
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:48.160]   And so I reoriented my whole creative life around pursuits
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.600]   where it doesn't really matter what you do tomorrow,
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.960]   but it does matter that over the next few months you do make a lot of progress.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.320]   So I began to get this allergy to crowded schedules
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.800]   because if I have crowded schedules every day, what happens when I'm tired
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.640]   or I'm sick? It's a problem.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.320]   But if I'm writing a book over like a four month period,
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.680]   I can have periods in there where I'm not I didn't write for two days is fine
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.440]   and I can come back on the other days when I'm doing better.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.040]   Right. Why do I why do I have a shutdown routine?
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.680]   Because the anxiety of thinking about my doctoral dissertation
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.920]   was keeping me distracted me in the evening.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:24.040]   I had to invent the shutdown routine to try to tame that.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:28.080]   Why do I have fixed schedule productivity to make sure that I don't work too much
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:31.800]   like that and to keep things to keep things reasonable? Right.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.400]   Why do I limit the number of projects I work on?
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.480]   I know we joke I have seven jobs, but what do I do?
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:39.200]   I'm a professor and I write and I even made those the same thing now
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.720]   because now I write about the things that I study as a professor.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.560]   I don't use social media.
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.200]   It took me 10 years to start a podcast.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:46.600]   I only give it a half day a week.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.080]   And even that stresses me out.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:50.760]   So like my whole life is dealing with.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.120]   I'm not someone that can work 15 hour days.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.240]   I'm not the smartest person in the room.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.080]   Stuff takes time.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.560]   I'm not always the best visionary.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.240]   I come to insight slow.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.360]   And so my whole idea is like, don't do too many things.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.520]   Give yourself flexibility and just try to work very steadily
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.240]   on the things that matter.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.480]   This is Steve Martin's advice.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.520]   You know, be be so good.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.280]   They can't ignore you. Eventually good things will come.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.200]   That's my whole motto.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:19.040]   So all of my systems are really trying to deal with an imperfect reality.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:21.160]   You know, because I can't.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:26.640]   Sit there and crank on math equations all day or write 15 hours a day.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.000]   So you shouldn't think about things that way.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.840]   It should be about there's only so much I can do.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.480]   Let me like and we're imperfect and we're variable.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.040]   So how do I make sure, given all that reality and all that chaos,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.800]   how do I make sure that I'm still making forward progress
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   on the things that matter so that even if last week was a disaster?
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   Last year will be something that I'm proud of.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.720]   And all this idea is what I've been working on for 20 years
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.040]   now is all sort of consolidated in slow productivity.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.000]   That's where that philosophy came from.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.440]   It's like how to produce cool stuff if you're a human.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.640]   So I appreciate the appreciate the call.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.480]   Let's do a quick case study.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.080]   Let's see. All right.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.040]   So the case study is not slow productivity theme.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.880]   So let's let's call this the end of the slow productivity takeover
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.560]   and get that theme music one more time, Jesse.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:21.680]   All right, that was great.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:24.400]   Slow productivity case over by the book, if you haven't read it.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.000]   Review the book, if you read it and liked it.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.200]   All right. Case studies from M.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.840]   Hi, Cal, I'm a diplomat with the U.S.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.400]   Department of State, currently stationed overseas.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   I use your ideas to plan my next career move within my organization.
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:41.280]   In the Foreign Service, we rotate assignments every two to three years,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.960]   and I had been feeling a bit burnt out with my current position
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.720]   and not motivated to start looking for my next job.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:51.920]   Using your lifestyle centric career planning, I set criteria
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.880]   for the types of positions I would target.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.360]   I wanted to move back to D.C.
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.360]   and avoid positions involving emergency or after hours duties.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.160]   I had accepted that this could be a career detour and not great for promotion.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.720]   But to my surprise, I found many intriguing positions that match my criteria.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.680]   Last month, I happily accepted an offer at the State Department's
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.080]   Diplomatic Training Institute.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:19.000]   I will be leading a medium sized team, so it will still be a substantive role,
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.800]   but it offers an element of seasonality, flexibility
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.040]   and hopefully no after hours emergencies.
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.080]   I think this position will be a great fit as I transition back to the U.S.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.160]   with my family.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.360]   What I like about this case study is that it really does highlight
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.520]   the power of lifestyle centric career planning too often,
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.920]   especially if you're high achieving.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.600]   You just let the criteria of like what is objectively the most impressive
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.400]   job of my options be what drives you.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:52.320]   You imagine it's going to sound great when I say I'm now the senior diplomat
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.400]   in the such and such consulate.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.680]   But it turns out the opportunities you have to say that and receive praise,
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.520]   you know, it's like seven times in the year.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.440]   And then you're stuck with the reality of that job,
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.480]   and it might have elements to it that you hate.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.960]   So by far, the more sane thing to do if you're trying to build a sustainable
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.520]   career is to say, what do I want in my lifestyle in general?
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.200]   What type of place do I want to live in?
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.720]   What is the rhythm of my day like?
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.040]   What's the feel of my work like?
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.600]   What else is going on in my life?
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:24.960]   And work backwards from that to figure out your career.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.000]   This is a great example of that.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.600]   So our correspondent here has a good sense from the State Department
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:35.160]   Foreign Service what it's like to have these after hours or emergency duties.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.960]   He knows he doesn't want that.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.120]   He wants seasonality, flexibility, the type of stuff I like,
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.760]   more of a slow, productive,
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.200]   compatible role, knowing that working backwards from that lifestyle
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.640]   led him to choices that want to just be the obvious next thing to choose.
[00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.640]   And I think this is a really cool choice he made.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.880]   You know, I became a professor in part because of lifestyle
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:56.800]   centric career planning.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.480]   I wanted the flexibility, the ability to write and have seasonality.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.360]   There's less money in this than going to the tech jobs
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.520]   I had offers for out of college.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.240]   But I wasn't trying to do the most impressive thing.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.800]   I was trying to do the thing that fit my lifestyle vision better.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.720]   So I think it was a great case study
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.080]   of lifestyle centric career planning and action.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.200]   If you're new and you want to know more about that,
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:22.160]   probably the best book of mine to read is So Good They Can't Ignore You from 2012.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.560]   That's my contrarian take on building a career that you love.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.200]   We have a final segment coming up, we're going to react to something interesting.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.440]   But first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.600]   I want to talk in particular about our friends at Policy Genius.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.880]   You need to make life insurance part of your financial planning.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.920]   If there's anyone who depends on you, you need to have enough
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:52.400]   life insurance to take care of them in the case of the tragic.
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:57.120]   Now, the thing is, most people who know this, what's holding them back
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.680]   is the ambiguity about how do I get life insurance?
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.280]   Where do I go? Who do I talk to?
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.600]   Do I have to have a doctor do something?
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.440]   Just sounds complicated.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.320]   I'll put it off.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.880]   But putting it off is a problem, because the older you get,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.240]   the more expensive the life insurance becomes.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   The right time to get a term life insurance policy is always right now.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.720]   It's never going to be cheaper.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.240]   This is why I like Policy Genius, because it takes all the ambiguity
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.520]   out of this process.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.360]   It makes it easy.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.240]   Policy Genius has license award winning agents and technology
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.320]   that simplifies the process of comparing life insurance quotes
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.120]   from America's top insurers.
[01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.880]   You can be just a few clicks away from getting your lowest price
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.400]   with Policy Genius.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.920]   You can find life insurance policies that start at just two hundred
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.600]   and ninety two dollars per year for a million dollars of coverage.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.240]   Some of the options have same day approval
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.400]   and avoid unnecessary medical exams.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.800]   Remember, Policy Genius is a broker.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.040]   It works for you, not the insurance companies.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.200]   Their incentive is to make you happy, to get you the best price,
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.440]   to get you the best policy.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.400]   The thousands of five star reviews on Google and Trust Pilot
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.160]   show they have succeeded in this goal.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.800]   So save time and money and provide your family
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.480]   with a financial safety net using Policy Genius.

[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.200]   Also want to talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.240]   After years of fine print contracts
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.760]   and getting ripped off by overpriced wireless providers,
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.800]   if you've learned anything, it should be that there's always a catch.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.240]   So when I heard that for a limited time, all Mint Mobile
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.800]   wireless plans are fifteen dollars a month.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.200]   When you purchase a three month plan, I thought, what's the catch?
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.600]   What I've discovered is there is no catch.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.200]   Mint Mobile's secret sauce is that they sell wireless service online.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.160]   They cut out the cost of retail stores and pass those sweet savings
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.640]   directly to you, allowing you to get a premium wireless plan
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.240]   for just fifteen dollars a month.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   We're talking high speed data, unlimited talk and text
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.040]   delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.760]   You can use your own phone with your Mint Mobile plan.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.200]   Bring your phone number along, bring along all your existing contacts.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.320]   All you're cutting out is the price.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.520]   I've been talking a lot about Mint Mobile recently in my interviews
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.000]   when people are asking me about kids and smartphones.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.680]   I'm a believer.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.440]   I'm in John Heights camp that really unlimited Internet
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.600]   access through a smartphone is something you should be
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.640]   probably 15 or 16 before you get.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.600]   So parents are saying, how do I stay in touch with my kid
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.920]   if I don't want to just give them?
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.280]   An iPhone or add a phone to my expensive wireless plan,
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.880]   I say, here's how you do it.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.040]   You buy them a cheap, dumb phone on Amazon.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.440]   You go to Mint Mobile, $15 a month, get that SIM card, plug it in.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.200]   Boom, they can text you and call you.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.480]   Now you've solved the logistical problems
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.040]   without also giving them access to, you know,
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.600]   Fortnite pornography or whatever kids are doing on the phones these days.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.360]   So Mint Mobile gets it done.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.480]   To get this new customer offer and your new three month
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.680]   unlimited wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.120]   go to MintMobile.com/Deep.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.640]   That's MintMobile.com/Deep.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.480]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at MintMobile.com/Deep.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.200]   $45 upfront payment required.
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.040]   New customers on first three month plan only.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.800]   Speed slower by 40 gigabytes on limited plan.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.560]   Additional tax fees and restrictions apply.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.800]   See Mint Mobile for details.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:44.560]   You know, Jesse, I think Mint Mobile is going deep on Georgetown spokespeople.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.720]   How so?
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.360]   Well, another prominent Mint Mobile spokesperson,
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.920]   some might even say more prominent than me, that's debatable,
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.240]   is Bradley Cooper, who is a Georgetown alum.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.320]   So Bradley Cooper and I are representing Georgetown on the Mint Mobile team.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.040]   He might get paid a little bit more than me to do the spots.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.200]   I don't know for sure, but.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.160]   You should have your agent negotiate a new deal for you.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.400]   Let me say between Bradley Cooper and me.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.280]   So like the Georgetown spokespeople for Mint Mobile between us,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.280]   we earned three Academy Award nominations.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.960]   So that's pretty good.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.800]   Look, I mean, that's three more than a lot of people.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.360]   All right. Enough of that nonsense.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.160]   Let's do our final segment.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.600]   So for our final segment, I like to react to something interesting
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.800]   I've encountered recently, and today I want to talk about an article
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.880]   that many of you sent me from The Wall Street Journal.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.000]   I'll bring the headline up here on the screen.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.400]   Cool graphic here of the TikTok logo with a cage below it
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.240]   and someone walking out of the cage.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.360]   The article is written by a reporter who has an awesome name
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.760]   for writing tech articles, Julie Jargon.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.520]   It's an awesome name.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.840]   The article is titled Why Some 20 Somethings Are Saying No to TikTok.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:02.240]   I also wrote about this article in my newsletter.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.120]   So if you don't subscribe, you should at calnewport.com.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.440]   So here's the thing they're talking about.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.840]   The news hook for this article is that TikTok reported a near 10 percent drop.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.920]   In users between 18 and 24.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.840]   That's a lot for one year to lose 10 percent of a user group,
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.600]   especially when you're a service that is advertising yourself
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   to investors as being on the rise.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.840]   So Julie Jargon went to talk to some of these users,
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.120]   some of these young 20 something users of TikTok and say, why did you quit?
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.840]   What she found was they were getting uneasy
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.640]   with their addictive relationship to the tool.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:44.000]   She profiled one reader in particular who couldn't put it down.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.360]   So he would hold it.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.680]   He could only take garbage bags to the outside, to the can one at a time
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.640]   because he had the whole tick tock while he's putting out the garbage that cook.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.320]   He would hold the phone with one hand and chop with the other.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.720]   Like he literally couldn't have it out and be watching it.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.560]   And at some point he realized, like, this is probably not great.
[01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.200]   Like this is probably not maximizing my chances of a full and healthy life.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.400]   And and he got off of it.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:07.960]   It's hard.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.600]   And a lot of them say like the addictive thing meant they had to try multiple times.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.040]   It was very much
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.600]   reminiscent of the way you hear people talking about quitting smoking.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.520]   The fourth time it stuck, the sixth time it stuck.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.200]   So it's interesting.
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.080]   There was definitely the terminology of addiction
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.200]   when people are talking about leaving the service.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:32.120]   But what I thought was relevant about this
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.520]   was it is a demonstration of the idea
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   that I talked about in this article.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.360]   We look at in The New Yorker from 2022.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.520]   Jesse, it's a similar graphic.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.760]   I'm looking at this.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.200]   Interesting.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.800]   My article is first, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.680]   So this article also has a graphic of people leaving curved cages.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.000]   So I wrote this article in the summer of 2022 called Tick Tock
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.960]   in the fall of the social media giants.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.880]   And I'm going to argue that in this New Yorker piece,
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.120]   I predicted a dynamic that we are now seeing reported on
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:01.800]   in this more recent Wall Street Journal piece.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.600]   What I said in this New Yorker piece.
[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.160]   It's Tick Tock is making a bit of a Faustian bargain.
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:11.000]   They're going all in on being as addictive as possible,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.200]   which means the straight up algorithmic curation of the most addictive
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.960]   possible content they can give for each possible user.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.720]   As a result, they got very fast user growth and their users use it a lot.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.640]   But in doing so, they abandoned
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.080]   the model of the legacy social media giants
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.680]   in which their value proposition depends on a hard one social graph.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:38.200]   Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:42.040]   A big part of their value proposition was over the years.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.240]   Their users have painstakingly built up these social graphs
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.640]   of who their friends are and who they follow.
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   There is a huge first mover advantage here.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.440]   No other company will ever get users to spend so much time creating these graphs.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.480]   So only they have these giant social graphs.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.520]   No one else will have them again.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.440]   So the legacy social media players.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.640]   Have the social the social graphs that are a first mover advantage
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.720]   that they can entrench on.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.360]   Now, Tick Tock said those are great, but but depending just on a social graph
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.080]   doesn't give you the most addictive possible experience.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.000]   So we're going to give you the most addictive possible experience.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.240]   Here's the Faustian bargain.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:19.040]   The social graph might not give you the most addictive possible experience,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.880]   but I have a hard time leaving that service.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.520]   Because it's not just providing me an abstract stream of distraction,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.720]   it has all my friends on there that I've said it has these follower networks.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.520]   I've clicked. I don't want to leave that behind.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.800]   There's something there of value that doesn't exist elsewhere.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.320]   Tick Tock doesn't have that.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.760]   So what it's saying is people can walk away without losing anything.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.560]   Now, it's hard because it's addictive.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.880]   But once they break the addiction, they have not left behind
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:49.960]   a social graph, a collection of followers, people, friends that they've indicated.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.320]   It's just an abstract stream of brainstream stimulation,
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:57.000]   which they could replace with any other stream of brainstream stimulation.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.160]   They get with a video games or with podcasts or with high,
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.360]   high end streaming things or drug use. Right.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:05.120]   I mean, it's all kind of doing the same. It's all interchangeable.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.000]   This is the direction that the social media market's going in
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.040]   because you get more engagement with addiction, but it makes it more dynamic.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.240]   It makes it more tenuous.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.360]   And that's what I argued in this twenty twenty two article.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.480]   I said we're going to start to see a more tumultuous
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.400]   attention economy, digital attention economy landscape
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.200]   with services coming to go and and big sweeps.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.360]   And as people jump around the various things and I think with this
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.720]   migration of twenty something's away from tick tock all at once,
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.080]   we're seeing that thesis start to play out.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.200]   So I think those are the key dynamics to understand.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.200]   Social graph is a entrenched advantage
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.800]   that produce content that was more addictive than just straight news,
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.520]   straight production,
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:54.000]   pure algorithmic distraction is even more addicting and compelling,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.160]   but doesn't have the entrenchment of the social graph.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.200]   And so we're seeing the sort of endgame, I think, of the longstanding
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.040]   legacy players where you get lots more dynamic shifting in the market.
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.720]   Ultimately, I think that's good
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.480]   because when you don't have a small number of things
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.280]   that everyone feels compelled to use you as a pursuant of the deep life,
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.440]   have a lot more social flexibility to construct the online life that you want.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.480]   The more variety there is out there.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.520]   The more easy and acceptable it is for you to create something
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.640]   that you really like.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.120]   So I think ultimately, it's good news and it's cool to see
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.600]   the theories I predicted starting to actually play out in reality.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:34.120]   All right, Jesse, that's it.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.400]   I think that's our episode for today.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.800]   Thank you, everyone, for listening and or watching.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.600]   We'll be back next week
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.280]   with another normal episode of the Deep Questions podcast.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.160]   Remember to send your ideas
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.480]   for topics you like or want to hear about to jesse@calmedeport.com
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.040]   and otherwise I'll see you next week.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.000]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.800]   Hey, so if you enjoyed today's episode about single purpose notebooks,
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.680]   I think you'll also like episode 287, which is about my
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.360]   professional note taking systems.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.120]   You can compare the two.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.280]   I think you'll like it. Check it out.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.520]   We live in a distracted world.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.200]   We're bombarded by information, so we need some way to efficiently
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.280]   keep track of the information that matters.
