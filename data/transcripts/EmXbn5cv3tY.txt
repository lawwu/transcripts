[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Evening to the words that will be found in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   24, and going from verse 24 to the end of the chapter. In other words, I'm going to
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.920]   start reading at the point at which the previous reading ended. Twenty-fourth chapter of the
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.320]   Book of the Acts of the Apostles, verse 24 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:36.040]   "And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:45.280]   he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. And as he reasoned of
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:54.520]   righteousness temperance and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, 'Go thy way
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.680]   for this time. When I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.' He hoped also that
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.160]   money should have been given him of Paul, that he might lose him. Therefore he sent
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.840]   for him the offer and communed with him. But after two years, Porcius Festus came into
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.960]   Felix's room, and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.440]   Now this incident, recorded in these verses, as you will see, comes as a kind of sequel,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.120]   if you like, epilogue to the story which is recorded in the first twenty-three verses
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:53.360]   of this chapter. It is, again, one of the great dramatic stories which are to be found
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.560]   in the pages of the Scriptures. It is full of intense interest and dramatic excitement.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.440]   It is, indeed, a kind of drama. Now I am sure you will all agree with me when I say that
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.560]   whenever you are reading or studying a drama or a play, it is very important that you should
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.600]   know something about the characters who are to appear before you. Anybody who has ever
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.720]   had to study a play of Shakespeare as a pupil or as a student, or anybody who is doing so
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   now, will know that if you take up a volume with a play of Shakespeare in it, you open
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:47.760]   it out, you want to start at scene one, act one. But you will notice generally that before
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.880]   you come to that, on the right-hand side of the early pages, on the left-hand side, facing
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:04.680]   scene one, act one, there is a heading, "Dramatis Personae," and under that you have the names
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.280]   of the chief characters that are going to appear before you in the play, in the drama,
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.720]   and a very brief synopsis of their history and of their story. Now that is a very great
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.360]   help because you cannot quite understand what happens to people and why it happens unless
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   you know something about them. And that is why you always have this "Dramatis Personae,"
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.280]   giving you a kind of introduction to the drama that is to follow.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.560]   Well now, if that is necessary with all plays and dramas, it is particularly important when
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.520]   you deal with a drama and a story such as this which we are going to look at tonight.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.840]   It's a drama which has three people only in it, just three. Two of them are sitting upon
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.640]   some kind of throne, three of them rather I should say, are sitting upon some kind of
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.400]   throne and standing before them is a little man speaking to them and addressing them.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:23.440]   Who are these people? Well, sitting on the throne we have a man called Felix and we are
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.600]   told that he was the Roman governor. That is about all we are told about him here. But
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.560]   I can tell you a great deal about this man. It is not in the Bible but it is in the secular
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:46.040]   history books which record the history of that period. Felix was one of two brothers,
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   in fact he had a twin brother whose name was Pallas, P-A-L-L-A-S. And these boys were born
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.920]   as slaves. There were many slaves as you know in the ancient world and these two were born
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.560]   as slaves. But they were bright boys, they were highly intelligent boys and they used
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.240]   their intelligence and they got on and they improved their circumstances. Well, not so.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.080]   But eventually they became freemen of the great Roman Empire. Now that was no small
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.440]   prize. Anybody and everybody could not become freemen. You had to have something special
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.240]   about you. Well, these two boys had used their intelligence and their brains and they got
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.680]   advancement and at last they became freemen of the great Roman Empire. Not only that,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.800]   Pallas, the twin brother of Felix, had actually succeeded in becoming the great favorite of
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   the then Roman Emperor. He was his right hand man, his personal assistant, the man to whom
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.960]   he turned always for advice and for guidance. And of course, Pallas having got into such
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   an important post himself and having such influence with the Emperor had used his position
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.680]   in order to get a good post for his brother. You see, they did that in the first century.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.960]   We are not the first to do that. Mankind has always done this kind of thing. So Pallas
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.080]   had used his influence with the Emperor to get a good position for his brother and so
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.920]   we find that Felix was actually the governor of Palestine at that time. Rome had recently
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.480]   conquered Palestine and whenever she conquered a country she always set a governor over the
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.120]   country and he was directly responsible to the Emperor of that Rome. So here is Felix
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.240]   in a very great position, a freeman now and the representative of the Imperial Majesty
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.120]   in this conquered land of Palestine. Not only that, I can tell you this about him. Though
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.920]   he was in a very high position, he obviously still had a mean kind of soul. You heard in
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.000]   the reading how he was sitting in judgment on Paul and if he had any real sense of justice
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.080]   he would have set the Apostle at liberty at once. For Paul had not contravened any law,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.680]   he was guilty of no crime. Yet this man who had it in his power to set Paul at liberty
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:33.120]   kept him bound and as a prisoner. Indeed a Roman historian called Tacitus said of this
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:42.000]   man Felix that he exercised the prerogatives of a prince in the spirit of a slave. Very
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.320]   well, there is the man Felix. Sitting by his side there is a lady and we are told that
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:56.680]   her name was Drusilla. What we are actually told is this, after certain days when Felix
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:06.160]   came with his wife Drusilla and all we are told about her is this, which was a Jewess.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   But I can tell you more about this lady again as I did about Felix. And what I can tell
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:22.000]   you about her is this. This woman Drusilla belonged to the royal family of the Jews.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.680]   You read about the kings named Herod in the Gospel, the Herodian dynasty. Well now she
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.080]   belonged to that family of the Herodians. She had royal blood as the phrase goes in
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.200]   her vein. It was her great grandfather who had murdered those innocent male children
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:51.800]   at the time of the birth of our Lord. It was her great uncle who very unjustly had beheaded
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.800]   John the Baptist. Well we are not responsible for what our forefathers may have done but
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.800]   family history can be of some interest and can sometimes help us to understand people.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.920]   Well but I can tell you something more personal about her. This woman was a very ambitious
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.640]   woman and she was so ambitious that she had broken one of the fundamental rules of her
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.880]   race. It was a rule as you know among the Jewess that you should never marry outside
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:31.080]   your own race. A Jew should always marry a Jewess, a Jewess should always marry a Jew.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:40.240]   But this woman was very anxious to be a princess and so she had actually married a pagan prince.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.440]   Now she shouldn't have done this but she did it. She was anxious to get on, ambitious.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:53.280]   And spitting upon the sanctities of her nation she had married a pagan prince. How did this
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.160]   come to pass? Well the story is this. Somebody held a great reception on one occasion, a
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:05.840]   great banquet and reception. And amongst the people invited to the banquet were the Roman
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   governor Felix and Drusilla and her pagan prince husband. And they met. And as you read
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.560]   in the newspapers today about the film stars and others, the moment they looked at one
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.520]   another they fell in love with one another. Of course it's got nothing to do with love,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:34.160]   it's pure lust. However, this is what happened to them. And Drusilla had left her husband
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:41.400]   and she was now living as the wife of Felix. It was a very simple thing for a man in Felix's
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.800]   position to have a paper divorce. He could even write it himself and he had done this.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:54.200]   And so here they are living ostensibly as husband and wife but in reality they are living
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.960]   in a state of adultery. Very well, there are the two people who are sitting there on that
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:08.600]   luxurious couch clad in the most beautiful garments. And the third member, the third
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:18.480]   person in our drama, is standing before them. According to all accounts he was a short man,
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:26.320]   nothing much to look at, nothing like a film star. Bald headed we read, beak nose and a
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.600]   terrible inflammation of his eyes which made him almost repulsive to look at. And there
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:39.640]   he stands with chains hanging heavily from his wrists and he's addressing these two people
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:47.720]   on the bench on this kind of throne. Who is this? Well, this happens to be the mighty
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:57.400]   Apostle Paul, the representative of the Lord Jesus Christ and he's addressing them. Now
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.800]   you would have expected that a man like this who was a prisoner, who suddenly gets an opportunity
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.560]   of addressing the man who has power to set him at liberty. You would have expected, wouldn't
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.320]   you, that the poor prisoner would be very nervous and that he'd be trembling in anxiety
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:22.080]   and in nervousness. But that isn't what we read. We don't read that Paul trembled but
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   what we are told is that Felix trembled. What is this? What's it got to do with us,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:34.800]   says someone? I can hear somebody saying, "All right, that's an interesting story,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:41.600]   it's a very dramatic incident as you say, but you know we are living in 1975 now and
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.080]   our country and our world are in terrible trouble and you've got anything better to
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.920]   say to us than to remind us of some old story of something that happened 1900 long years
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.040]   ago. I came, says this man, to have something relevant, something to help me today. Is that
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:05.200]   all you've got to offer us?" Well, let me explain. I'm calling your attention to this
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.840]   not because it is a great story. I agree with you. The world in which we are living is in
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.040]   such a desperate plight we can't afford the luxury of simply reading stories about what
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:24.440]   happened in the past. I'll tell you why I'm calling attention to it. It's because here
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:30.520]   we are told very plainly what the message of the Christian Church is to our modern world
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:41.800]   at this moment. In Felix and Lucilla I see the modern world. In Paul I see the message
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:48.680]   of the Christian Church. And this is what we have to say tonight to the world in its
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.080]   present condition. Here is the greatest preacher, the greatest founder and establisher of churches
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.840]   that the Church and the world have ever known. Let's look at him. Let's learn the lessons
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   that are set before us so plainly and in such a dramatic manner in this old story. What
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.640]   are they? Well, the first lesson that I learn is a very general one. And you know these
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:19.960]   general lessons are important. We are told here as to how the Church should present her
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.800]   message to the world. Here I see the greatest preacher. How did he present his message to
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.120]   the ancient world? It's interesting to notice, isn't it? And what we notice is that he took
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:40.280]   charge of the situation, though he was a prisoner. What did he do? Well, I don't find that he
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:47.040]   entertained them. They probably wanted to be entertained, but he didn't do so. And
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.320]   the Church is not here to entertain people. If you want entertainment, go to the world.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.080]   It can do it very much better than the Church can. I don't find that the apostles sang
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:04.600]   to them, sang a solo. No, no. The position is too desperate for mere singing. It's a
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.760]   time for thought. What I'm told is this. He didn't even tell them stories. Now some people
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   think that that's preaching, telling people stories. He didn't even tell his own experience.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:24.440]   What did he do with them? He reasoned with them. Reasoned. There are so many people today
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.200]   who never go to a place of worship. And if you ask them why, they say, "Well, the Church,
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:37.400]   Christianity, what is it? Some stuff. A lot of emotionalism. Unintellectual, unintelligent
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.840]   people who meet together and they're singing hymns and choruses and getting intoxicated
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.520]   with music and working up an emotional atmosphere. I'm not interested," says the average man.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.760]   "I want something real. I want something that I can think about and reason about. Something
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:59.040]   with logic in it." Well, my friend, this is exactly what we have to give you. Paul
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:08.440]   reasoned. Reasoned. And this is the essence of our position tonight. I think before we
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:15.920]   finish, you will agree that I've called upon you to think in a way that you're not asked
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:23.160]   to think by a month or even a year of watching television or listening to the radio or any
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.240]   of the so-called pop music of this age. It's a time of crisis and what we must do is to
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:37.120]   think and to reason and apply our minds for all we are worth to the situation confronting
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.640]   us. That's what Paul did and that's what we are to do.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:47.320]   But we're also told here in general as to how we should listen to this Gospel. And you
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.920]   know this is equally important. Many of us who go into pulpits do the wrong thing. Many
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.920]   of you sitting in pews do the wrong thing. You have to listen in the right way. What's
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:10.320]   that? Well, what we're told is this, that Felix trembled. Why did he tremble? Well,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:17.280]   it was for this reason that the Apostle Paul wasn't talking about generality. He was talking
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:25.480]   directly to them. He was personal. And this is a very personal message. It comes to every
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.320]   one of us personally. If this message has not come to you personally, you've never
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.640]   really heard it. Or I wonder whether I might ask this question. Have you ever trembled
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:44.760]   as you've heard this message? Felix literally trembled, his knees knocked one against the
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.480]   other. Why? Well, because of the power of the message that came to him. And it's true.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:59.320]   Has it ever come to you like that? Have you ever been disturbed? Have you ever been made
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:06.880]   to feel afraid? Have you in some kind, in some shape or form, not of necessity physical,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.920]   but mental, spiritual, have you trembled? Have you felt concerned? And have you become
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:18.000]   anxious about yourself and your whole situation? If not, you've never heard this gospel.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:27.400]   No man can truly hear this gospel without knowing something about trembling. We must
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:34.880]   listen, therefore, for our lives, because it is something that deals with matters that
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.360]   are of the greatest moment to us and of the highest importance to every one of us. Very
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.000]   well, that's the general message. But come, I want to deal with a particular lesson. What's
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.720]   that? Well, it's this. What is the message of the Christian faith? That's the question.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.680]   And there's so much confusion about this today. I believe many people are outside the
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.880]   church for this reason. What is the content, the message of the gospel? Well, it's very
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:12.200]   interesting to notice what it isn't, isn't it? It isn't about politics. Isn't it surprising?
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:19.960]   Here is Paul, as I say, a prisoner, and imprisoned very unjustly. He's asked to address the
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:25.680]   governor, the supreme officer of the law. Well, you would have thought that it was a
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:33.080]   heaven-sent opportunity for Paul to protest against his imprisonment, to show its injustice,
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.160]   to plead with this man, either to set him at liberty himself or else to send up a message
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.400]   to the emperor asking him to set him at liberty. Here he is, he seems to have a heaven-sent
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.000]   opportunity of dealing with a political situation. Rome had conquered Palestine and had imposed
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.640]   on laws and on taxes. He's imprisoned. The whole thing's unjust. Why not make a protest?
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:03.080]   He does nothing of the sort. You know, my friends, the message of the church is not
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   a protest. There are so many people today who seem to me to think that the business
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   of the Christian church is to be always protesting, protesting against war, protesting against
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.480]   the bombs, protesting against apartheid in South Africa, or this or that. And they think
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.600]   that Christianity is nothing but a kind of political or social protest movement. She
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:31.080]   isn't. That's a travesty of the church. That is not her message. Paul simply did not
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:37.280]   do that at all, though he had a wonderful opportunity of doing so.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:45.680]   Well, then what is the message? Is it the message of the church simply to appeal to
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:53.520]   people to do more work and to discipline themselves? Some kind of moral exhortation? No, no. What
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:02.440]   is it? Paul reasoned with them. About what? About righteousness. What's that mean? He
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:09.320]   reasoned about righteousness. What does righteousness mean? Well, in many ways, this is the great
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:19.520]   word of the whole of the Bible. For this reason, that it is a term that is used about God himself.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:28.000]   God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. God is love. We are told many things
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.520]   about God, and one of the things we are told is that he is righteous. What's it mean?
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:46.120]   He's just, if you like. It means this, that in God there is nothing twisted, nothing perverted.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:55.720]   It's upright. It's clean. It's pure. It's holy. It's right, essential rightness, over
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:05.560]   and against sin, evil, wrong, everything twisted, perverted, dark, unworthy. That's righteousness.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:15.160]   And we are told that God is righteous. But we are also told that God made men in his
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:23.000]   own image and likeness, and he put into men something of the stamp of his own being and
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.360]   nature. In other words, the teaching of the Bible is that man was made upright, was endowed
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:37.640]   with an original righteousness. Man was made to be a companion with God and to have fellowship
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:43.160]   with God and to enjoy that. Well, you can't have any companionship or fellowship between
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:49.240]   light and darkness, between righteousness or uprightness and twisted and perverted things.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.120]   No, no. Man is made in the image and likeness of God. He was made perfect. There was nothing
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:59.920]   wrong in him. Nothing dark, twisted, unworthy, nothing wrong at all. Now, this is the essential
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:06.920]   meaning of righteousness. But if you want to know what it means in practice, well, the
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:12.680]   Bible has told us what it does. Man being made upright was meant to live an upright
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.120]   and a righteous life. What's that, says somebody? Well, I can tell you. The answer
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.520]   is, if you like, the Ten Commandments. That's the blueprint of righteousness and of righteous
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.480]   living. What's it mean? Well, the first half, you remember, tells us that we are made by
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.120]   God and for God and we are meant to worship God. And we are not to bow down before any
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.640]   graven image. We mustn't worship our country. We mustn't worship our class. We mustn't
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.160]   worship money. We mustn't worship motor cars. We mustn't worship sport. We mustn't
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:50.160]   worship drink or food. We must worship God alone. And then you come to the second half
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.640]   of the Ten Commandments. What do they tell us? Well, this is righteousness. Thou shalt
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:05.320]   not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not bear false
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:14.560]   witness against thy neighbor. Honor thy father and mother. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:20.560]   wife, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant. That's righteousness.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   That's how man is meant to live. That's what Paul preached about. Not a political
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:33.160]   purpose, not a social purpose, nothing about himself. But he addressed them on this great
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:38.440]   teaching concerning a holy and a righteous God, and that man was meant to live this kind
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:47.200]   of righteous life, that that is what God demands and expects of man. Righteousness. You see,
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.680]   he was preaching to those two people. He knew all about them and the way they were living
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:57.920]   together. So he addresses them on the being of man, what man is, what he's meant to
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.520]   be, and how he's meant to live. Righteousness. But wait a minute, he didn't stop at that.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:11.320]   The second thing he addressed them about was temperance. What is temperance? Unfortunately,
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:16.960]   we've tended to confine the meaning of this word. And when I use the word temperance,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:24.040]   we all tend to think instinctively of abstinence from alcoholic drinks. Well, that may come
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:32.240]   into it, but the word temperance is a very much bigger word than that. It means self-control.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:41.800]   It means discipline. It means continence. It's the opposite, you see, of in-temperance.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   In-continence, lack of discipline, living to gratify your lusts and passions.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:54.000]   Well, now someone may ask, well why did Paul trouble to speak about temperance if he'd
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.840]   already spoken about righteousness? Doesn't righteousness cover temperance? And the answer
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:09.480]   is that it does. Righteousness includes everything. Well, why did Paul then talk in particular
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.520]   about temperance? And I think I can give you the explanation. The difference between temperance
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:23.400]   and righteousness is this. Righteousness is a great statement in general principle about
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:30.800]   God and man and how men should live. Not temperance, it's the practical application of that. And
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:36.600]   you know, we are so subtle that we can agree with general principles and then fail to apply
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:42.440]   them in practice, so that we need to have it spelled out to us in detail. We don't
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.800]   just leave it as righteousness. We've got to come down and deal with it specifically
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:54.640]   in terms of temperance and actual behavior. Let me illustrate to you what I mean. The
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.400]   difference between righteousness and temperance can be put like this. I remember during the
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.920]   First World War hearing one of the most eloquent orations I've ever heard in my life. It was
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:18.760]   by a great statesman. And he was dealing with a war which had broken out in August 1914.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:26.480]   And he was waxing eloquent. And his theme was what he called the sanctity of international
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:35.000]   contracts. What he meant, of course, was this. Germany, you see, had had a treaty with Belgium.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.920]   And she had signed the treaty and solemnly pledged herself that she would never march
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:48.280]   into Belgium and attack her. It was a treaty. But what had she done on August the 4th, 1914?
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.800]   She had taken that treaty and had torn it up, a scrap of paper. She'd been disloyal
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:28:02.520]   to her contract, her international contract, signed, sealed, settled. She'd pledged herself,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:09.160]   she'd broken it all. So this man was speaking eloquently about the sanctity of international
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:15.320]   contracts. And he was waxing eloquent. His righteous soul had been offended by this action
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:25.160]   of Germany against Belgium. But you know, the diaries and the biographies have come
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:32.400]   out since then. And we now know, it's common knowledge, that this eloquent orator, who
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.520]   was so outraged by the way in which Germany hadn't observed the sanctity of international
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:45.120]   contracts, his very men was not being loyal to his own marriage contract at that very
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:52.840]   time. He had his mistress. And he was living with his mistress as well as with his wife.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.160]   You see, it's one thing to get excited and eloquent about righteousness as a general
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:01.760]   principle somewhere up in the air. It's a very different thing to be righteous in your
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.520]   own personal conduct. That's what's meant by temperance.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   Well, let me give you another illustration. I remember how in the 1930s, between the two
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:22.480]   wars, Germany again under Hitler suddenly entered, marched into Austria, raped that
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   country, and annexed that country to Germany. And men held up holy hands in righteous protestation
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:39.000]   against this foul act. Fancy a nation entering into another nation's land and taking it over
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.520]   in a violent manner. What a terrible thing to do. Yes, but you know the same men, they
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.720]   said nothing at all when their own friends did exactly the same thing with another man's
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.240]   wife and another man's home. When a man suddenly, deliberately entered into another
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.800]   man's married life and home and wrecked it and took that man's wife away and leaving
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.880]   the little children broken-hearted. Oh, that's all right. There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.320]   If a nation does it, righteousness is offended. But when a man does it, they see nothing wrong
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   in it. That's the difference between talking about righteousness and talking, you see,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:23.680]   about temperance. And Paul was addressing these two people who were living in adultery.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.120]   It's all very well for a statesman like Felix to talk about righteousness amongst nations
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:35.000]   and so on and to be administering law in general. How is he living? Is he applying it? Is he
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.600]   living in a temperate and in a righteous manner? Paul was applying his message to them.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.680]   And you know, my friends, this needs to be done. This is the whole trouble in the world
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.400]   tonight. There are many people who are ready to protest against apartheid in South Africa
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   and get very excited on the colour problem and many another. But in their personal lives,
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.440]   they're not interested in the principle of righteousness at all. And they're not living
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.640]   in a temperate and in a controlled and disciplined manner. They're living like animals.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:15.280]   This, you see, is a point which brings out the difference between a man and an animal.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:23.760]   What is it? Well, we can put it like this. An animal is governed by the instincts and
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.720]   the impulses and the desires of its body. And there's nothing wrong in that. It was
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:36.280]   made like that by God. The animal wants food and it takes it, wants drink and it takes
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.200]   it, sex and it takes it. Instinct, impulse, desire and immediate response without any
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.280]   thought or consideration. It's perfectly all right. What's the difference between a man
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.960]   and an animal? Well, a man's got a body and he's been given it by God. And there are instincts
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:01.880]   and impulses and desires in our body. There is what is called the gregarious instinct
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:07.320]   that brings us together in companies like this. Quite all right. There is the instinct
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:13.960]   and the desire for food. Right, obey it, nothing wrong. Drink, all right. Sex, let's be clear
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:20.120]   about this, there's nothing wrong with sex. It is God who's created sex, not man. The
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.600]   Bible never denounces sex. That's a complete travesty. You have an understanding of the
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.720]   scriptural teaching. Sex is created by God. Male and female created be them. There's nothing
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:38.160]   wrong with sex. These instincts and impulses and desires that are in us all are quite legitimate.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:47.040]   But man is not only a body, he's got a soul. He's got reason. He's got intellect. He's
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:52.960]   got understanding. He can examine himself. He can consider possibilities. He can evaluate
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.680]   himself in situations and he can condemn or exonerate himself. Man has got this extra
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:05.480]   quality. He can judge, evaluate, estimate, decide. Not only that, he's got a spirit
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.560]   which links him with the unseen and with God and with the eternal. So man, you see, is
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.040]   not a mere animal. He is. He has an animal part, but he's above the animal. He's got
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:22.760]   this higher quality that God has given him. And a man is not meant to be controlled and
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.320]   governed by his instincts and desires and impulses as the animal is. Man is meant to
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:35.600]   govern them by his reason, by his understanding, by his spirit, and by his eternal destiny.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.080]   And the whole tragedy of the world is that man is no longer doing that. Men and women
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.440]   are living like animals, obeying their instincts. If they feel like a thing, why not do it?
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.240]   They don't stop to consider consequences to themselves nor anybody else. They walk
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.000]   out and they do things, whatever the consequences may be. They're living in an intemperate
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.040]   manner. They're living like animals. It's the cause of trouble. As it was in the ancient
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.720]   world, it is in the modern world.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:15.560]   And the third thing that Paul preached about was judgment to come. What's this? Well,
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:21.720]   this is the thing that you very rarely hear about in the modern world. We had two general
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:29.400]   elections last year. Did you hear anything about judgment to come? Of course you didn't.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:37.200]   The world doesn't believe in judgment to come. And that's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   That's why there's lawlessness right through society. They know nothing about judgment
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.480]   to come. But it's the great theme of the Bible. What's it mean? It means this, that man is
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:55.320]   a responsible being, created in the image and likeness of God, meant for God, and that
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:01.320]   God holds him responsible. Though a man doesn't believe in God, he'll still have to meet him.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:09.040]   God started the time process. He's going to end it. There's a great day of judgment coming.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.360]   Whether we like it or not, we shall be in it. National health service doesn't cure death.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:23.280]   We've all got to die. And after death, the judgment, judgment to come. The Lord Jesus
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:28.640]   Christ talked about it. Everybody in the Bible talks about it. It's a compliment to man,
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.680]   in a sense. Man is not an animal. And when he dies, it isn't the end. The body dies,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   the soul goes on. It stands before his judge and his maker eternal. He has to give an account
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.160]   of the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. And I can hear Paul preaching on judgment
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   to come to Felix and Drusilla. And this is what I hear him saying. He says, "Most noble
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.800]   Felix, you are the Roman governor. You're the representative of the imperial majesty
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.440]   of Rome. And you're the head of the legal system and of all the courts in this country.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.800]   You are on the bench and I'm the prisoner. But you know a day is coming when you will
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:14.040]   be on trial. And all emperors and kings and everybody else will all stand before God in
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.560]   the last judgment. And everyone will have to meet him and give him an account of what
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:26.160]   he's done with his soul and his spirit, how he's lived in this world. And the test will
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   be this, that we are all made by God and we are meant to live this righteous life. What's
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:38.400]   that? Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and all thy
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:45.480]   mind and all thy strength. And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. That's the judgment.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.720]   And if we haven't lived to the glory of God and loved him and loved our neighbor, we are
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:55.440]   under God's wrath and condemnation. And if we die like that, we go to eternal perdition
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.720]   and misery. This is the message of the Bible. It is my message. It's what Paul preached
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:06.120]   to these people. It's what our Lord himself preached. Judgment to come. This is Christianity,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120]   my friends.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:19.000]   Well, thank God the message doesn't stop at that. For if it did, we'd be all hopeless.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.120]   But we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God. There is none righteous, no,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:38.680]   not one. The whole world lies guilty before God. Thank God. The gospel doesn't end there.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:45.360]   That's the introduction. It goes on. What's it talk about? The faith in Christ. The faith
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:54.040]   in Christ. What's it mean? Oh, thank God for this. It's our only hope, my friends. For
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:59.640]   we're all under condemnation, every one of us. But there's a possibility of escape. There's
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.400]   a way of salvation. The faith in Christ. And I can hear Paul pleading with Felix and Drusilla.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.200]   He said, look here, you're living in sin. You're going to be judged by God. If you die
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.320]   like that, you're going to eternal misery. But listen, if you acknowledge your sin, if
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:19.920]   you repent, God has worked out a way of forgiveness. He's laid your sins on his own son and he's
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.720]   punished him. He told them about Jesus of Nazareth, that he's the son of God, that he
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.840]   came into the world in order to save it. He's the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:34.880]   the world. God has laid our sins upon him. He's punished them in him. He offers us three
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:39.160]   pardon and forgiveness. You don't become a Christian by turning over a new leaf and living
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   a better life and doing good works and so justifying yourself. No, no. You simply believe
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   on the Lord Jesus Christ and you're saved. Justification by faith only. The faith in
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:58.640]   Christ. And I can hear Paul pleading with them to abandon this evil way of life, to
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   confess their sin to God and acknowledge it and to cast themselves upon God's mercy.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.960]   That's the Christian message. That's what we've got to say to the world tonight, as
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.600]   it is. I'm not here to talk economics or politics. I'm not here to ask you to make sacrifices.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.880]   No, no. That's not the business of the church nor of Christianity. I'm asking you to be
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:28.080]   ready to meet your God, to face your eternal destiny. This is our message. And to tell
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.600]   you that whatever you may have been hitherto, if you but confess it and acknowledge it and
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:41.680]   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, you can be saved immediately, reconciled to God and
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.640]   become an heir of eternal blessing. That's the message.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.040]   How I wish I could tell you that the result of this preaching by Paul was that Felix and
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   Priscilla believed it, accepted it, confessed their sin, believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.560]   gave up their sinful life and became Christians and lived happily ever afterwards. But I can't
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:11.520]   tell you that because it didn't happen. That isn't what happened. What happened was this,
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:18.040]   that as Paul was reasoning about righteousness, temperance and judgment to come, Felix trembled.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:22.440]   And he stopped Paul and sent him back to the cell. And then he'd send for him occasionally
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:27.760]   and hear it again, send him back again. He didn't repent. He didn't believe. He didn't
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:35.600]   become a Christian, nor does he now. Why not? Why is it that people are not Christians?
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:40.800]   Have you ever thought of it? Have you thought of it like this? Look at our world tonight.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.880]   Look at the trouble. Wherever you turn, wherever you look, whatever news bulletin you listen
[00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:56.760]   to or see, it's always trouble. Strife, unhappiness, separation, divorce, infidelity, agony of
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:03.840]   soul, hold-ups, murders, all that we are so familiar with. And everything is being tried
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.880]   and nothing works. Here's the only thing that can work, but the one thing that people won't
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:17.720]   listen to. They dismiss it as irrelevant, they despise it. Why? Why are people not Christians?
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.560]   Why do they reject this message as Felix and Drusilla did? Well, if you ask the average
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:28.120]   man of the world why he rejects this message, this is what he'll tell you. He'll tell you
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.800]   that he rejects it because he's a man of brains and of intelligence and of understanding,
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.520]   a man who can think and who can reason. As I said at the beginning, he says, "You know,
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:45.360]   in those chapels they've got nothing but soft stuff. It's the dope, the opium of the people,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.440]   something that sends people to sleep. They're just a pack of emotionless. They don't think,
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.320]   they don't reason, they don't meet the facts of life." That's what they say, isn't it?
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:01.680]   But you know, I can prove to you from this one case that that is quite wrong. Why do
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:07.960]   people reject this gospel? Is it because of their great reason? It's the exact opposite,
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:15.880]   and I'll prove it to you like this. If you tell me that the reason why a man is not a
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:21.400]   Christian is because of his great brain, his great reason, his great understanding, what
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:27.960]   you're telling me is this, that Felix and Priscilla have greater brains than the Apostle
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   Paul, that they were greater thinkers, greater reasoners, greater logicians, and that is
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:42.080]   just sheer rubbish and nonsense. This is one of the greatest intellects that the world
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.120]   has ever known. And if there's anybody here tonight who wants a little mental exercise
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.600]   in gymnastics, I can tell you exactly what to do. Start studying the epistles to the
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.120]   Romans and the Ephesians, and that will be more than enough for you as long as you're
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:03.160]   in this world. This mighty intellect, this great genius, he believes the gospel, they
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:08.880]   reject it. Why do people reject the gospel? Because they don't think, because they won't
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:15.200]   think, because they deliberately refuse to think. This case proves it, and I can prove
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:22.960]   it to you tonight like this. What's wrong with this gospel? Why do people reject it?
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:31.040]   What's wrong in believing in God? What's wrong in living according to the Ten Commandments?
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:37.600]   Why do people reject it with such scorn? Did you know this, my friend? If everybody in
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:44.000]   the world tonight submitted to God and started living according to the Ten Commandments,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.560]   this world would become paradise. There'd be no more petty theft and robberies in business
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:58.000]   and industry and in your railway yards. There'd be no dishonesty and faking of accounts, or
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.320]   the various other manifestations of dishonesty. There'd be no promiscuity. There'd be no
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:09.480]   more permissiveness. There'd be no more pornography. There'd be none of the things that are disgracing
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:16.880]   the life of humanity. It would all disappear, and the world would become paradise. And yet
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:24.560]   people reject this with scorn. Is that reason? It is the absence of reason. It is the failure
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:31.160]   to reason. It's this instinctive, impulsive living, not governed by thought. Men and women
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:36.120]   are going on to a great crisis. Are they stopping to think? Are they taking any? No, not at
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.800]   all. They're hoping it will pass, that the cloud will go around. It's gone in the past.
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.840]   It'll happen again. And on and on they go, as they did before the last war, and as they've
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:51.080]   done so often, and as the people did in the days before the flood, and knew not until
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.680]   the flood came and carried them all away. It's the lack of reason. Felix and Drusilla
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:03.040]   wouldn't face the facts. They wouldn't reason. They trembled and sent Paul back to the cell.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.440]   But they not only go against reason. The man who rejects this gospel goes against his reason,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:14.240]   but he also goes against his conscience. You can't reject this message without violating
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:19.400]   your conscience. We've all got a conscience, a sense of right and wrong, and good and evil.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:26.160]   How do you say, says someone, that Felix violated his conscience? Well, I say just this. Felix
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   trembled. Why did he tremble? Paul had no power. He was a prisoner in the chains. He
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.480]   couldn't put Felix into prison. Yet, nevertheless, Felix trembled. Why? Because he knew that
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:45.560]   what Paul was saying was right. He knew it, but he didn't want to do it. So a conflict
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.400]   arose. His brain recognized the truth of this mighty argument, and yet it would mean leaving
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.160]   Drusilla, and he didn't want to. So there's the conflict, and he sends Paul back to the
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:01.520]   cell. He violates, he silences his conscience. Every man who rejects this gospel is guilty
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:08.960]   of the same. And thirdly, he not only violated his conscience, he resisted the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:14.480]   When Paul preached, the Spirit was working in mighty power, and the Spirit convicts us
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:21.560]   of sin. We know it's right, and yet people deliberately resist the Spirit, as Felix and
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.320]   Drusilla did. Well, that's why people are not Christians. That's why they reject the
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.360]   gospel. It's all here. What a mean thing sin is. What a terrible thing it is for a man
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:38.040]   to reject the gospel. Look at this man, Felix. There's something even contemptible about
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.920]   him, isn't there? Do you know what I read in the last verse? Listen to this, the last
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.200]   verse but one. He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.000]   loose him. Therefore he sent for him the offer, and communed with him. Just think of it. Here
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.440]   is the Roman governor, hoping to get money from this poor prisoner. What's the matter
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:06.400]   with him? Well, he's got a financial problem. If you keep two wives, you'll have one. And
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:14.080]   you see, the life of sin always leads to trouble. But what a disgrace. The representative of
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:19.840]   imperial Rome should be begging money, as it were, from this poor prisoner. That's what
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:25.680]   sin does. It debases men. It drags them down. Look at what we read of in our papers almost
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.360]   daily. Men in great and high positions. Look at the things they're capable of. This is
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:37.600]   always the trouble with a life of sin. Then listen to the last verse. But after two years,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:45.760]   Corpus Iustus came into Felix's room. And Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:51.880]   left Paul bound. He was replaced by these other men. But instead of setting Paul at
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:59.720]   liberty, he left him to linger as a prisoner in the cell. And why did he do it? To show
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:09.880]   the Jews a pleasure. What's that? The desire to be popular. Playing up to the crowd. Oh,
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.600]   contemptible. The life of sin and all the pomp and the show and the pretense of these
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.160]   clever people who never darken the doors of a place of worship. How contemptible they
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:26.680]   are. Craving for public applause. You know, even Hitler and other dictators have done
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:32.480]   the same. They all want to be popular. Though the people have no power, the great dictator
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:39.080]   wants to be popular with the people. That's why people reject the gospel. They prefer
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:48.000]   the opinions of men to the opinions of God. They prefer the pleasures of sin for a season
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.080]   to the joys of eternity. They set time before eternity. That's sin. That's why people
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:01.360]   reject the gospel. My dear friend, have you believed it? Do you accept it? Or are you
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.560]   like Felix and Drusilla? I plead with you, learn the lesson of these two people and do
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:15.600]   the exact opposite. And believe the gospel. This to me is so desperately urgent that I
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.280]   don't apologize for keeping you for another few minutes while I tell you the sequel to
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:27.160]   this story. Do you know what happened later to these two people? Well, I can tell you.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:34.720]   It's not here, but it is in the secular history books. What happened to Felix? Well, in less
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:42.800]   than two years after this incident, Felix lost his job. How did he lose it? For some
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:50.400]   inexplicable reason, his brother, his twin brother, Pallas, was dismissed by the emperor.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.640]   You know, these emperors, these great dictators, these great people, they're very unreliable
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:01.240]   and capricious people. You may be the great favorite today, you may be on the scrap heap
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:08.080]   tomorrow for no reason at all. Suddenly they change. Off you go, and the emperor dismissed
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:18.560]   Pallas. And because Felix was in his position, because Pallas was in his position, when Pallas
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:25.440]   fell, Felix fell with him. He was stripped of all his offices, and here he is without
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:35.160]   anything. He rejected the gospel, holding on to the pomp and ceremony and circumstance,
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:42.960]   and the joys of such a life. Suddenly he had lost them all and there's nothing.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:55.600]   What of Drusilla? Well, it's an amazing story. In AD 79, Drusilla and her son were spending
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:03.720]   the winter in the famous resort of Pompeii. You know, that place just south of Naples
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:08.600]   in Italy. People didn't go to the south of France in those days, I mean the great and
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.400]   very wealthy people. The place they went to, to winter, was Pompeii. The Bahamas were not
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.760]   known, they didn't go to the south of France, but they did go to Pompeii, and it was a remarkable
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:28.000]   place. If you were anybody at all, you always spent your winter in Pompeii. Great buildings,
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.680]   marvelous palaces, every conceivable entertainment that you could think of, and it was the place.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:41.880]   Halfway through the season, they always had a gala evening, and at this great occasion,
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:47.480]   of course, they started with a great feast, a great banquet, and that was followed by
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:54.840]   dancing and so on. And there they were, Felix and Drusilla, with others, in AD 79, and they
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:52:01.480]   came to the great gala night, halfway through the season. And they all turned up for the
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   feast, and everybody agreed that the ladies had never been so beautifully dressed. These
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   designers had excelled themselves, marvel, and the men suitably attired. As for the food,
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   well, the chefs, they'd gone beyond anything that anybody'd ever known. As for the drink,
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:27.480]   the wine, it was all vintage. It seemed to have been kept for years for this special
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:33.480]   occasion. Nobody'd ever tasted such quality wines, and each wine with each course. You
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   must have a special wine with each course. If you don't, you're a nobody. If you don't
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.480]   know how to drink with your meals, you're an entity. This, according to Lord Boothby,
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:49.480]   is the sign of the cultured life. Good food, good drink, good companionship. And sure it
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   was in profusion, and everybody agreed it was marvelous, and there was a band of girls.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   The band, the leader, and the orchestra, they were entirely beyond themselves. The music
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:07.480]   was ravishing, and the conversation was scintillating. It was the occasion of occasions. Of course,
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   then they finished that part, and they adjourned to the dancing, to the ballroom. And there
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   they went on dancing and talking and drinking and dancing and talking and drinking, hour
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   after hour and on and on it went. But of course, all good things must come to an end, alas,
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   sometime or another. And as day was breaking, the band stopped playing, and these great
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:36.480]   people shuffled or staggered as best they could to their beds or couches or dive ends
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   or whatever they had, as best they could, and they all were agreed it had been the night
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   of nights. How marvelous this is life for the capital L. How thrilling, how wonderful.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   And there they flopped onto their resting places, suddenly, and without a second's
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   warning, that great mountain just at the back of Naples and Pompeii, Mount Vesuvius, which
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:09.480]   as you know is a volcano, it suddenly erupted, and it belched forth its molten lava, and
[00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   the whole of Pompeii and all the people in it were destroyed and reduced to a heap of
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.480]   rubble and of ruins. You can still go and visit the ruins, that's the way it happened.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   And they were all killed, Drusilla and her son amongst them. She'd heard the gospel,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   the gospel that could have ensured eternal bliss and joy and happiness. She'd rejected
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   it because of the pleasures of a sinful life which she preferred. She'd had her fill of
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   it, but suddenly she's ushered out of time into eternity, from facing men and women to
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   facing God, without any warning and with nothing to say for herself. The convenient season
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   and every other season had come to an end, and her naked soul stands before the Judge
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   Eternal, ushered to an eternal destiny in a hopeless, helpless condition. That's the
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   story. My dear friend, have you thought about these matters? Have you considered your soul?
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   Have you ever faced your death? Have you ever visualized yourself standing before God? You've
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   got to, every one of us has to. That's what Christianity is about. I don't know what's
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:47.480]   going to happen. There are many important political, economic, social and other questions.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   That's not my problem. This is the most urgent thing of all. Whatever may happen to us as
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:06.480]   a country, your soul and mine, and our eternal destiny. Learn the lesson of Felix and Priscilla.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   Do the exact opposite of what they did. Don't dismiss this. Face it, acknowledge it, repent,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   confess your sin, your folly, ask God to have mercy upon you, and I can solemnly assure
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   you that he will. He so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Here it is, as our hymns
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   have been expressing it. Don't wait for any fitness, or dream of any fitness that you
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   can ever produce, just as you are without one plea. But that thy blood was shed for
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   me, and that thou bidst me come to thee. Tell him, O Lamb of God, I come. Let us pray.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:12.480]   O Lord, our God, we thank thee that in a world of darkness, and of sin and of shame and of
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   hopelessness, that this blessed gospel still comes to us, the faith in Christ. O God, open
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:31.480]   all our eyes to our condition, to our need, to our desperate plight, but above all, open
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   our eyes to the beauty and the glory of thy dear Son as the Savior of our souls, our only
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   Deliverer and our only Lord. God, save the people, have mercy upon us, and unto thee
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   and unto thee alone shall we give all the praise and all the honor and all the glory,
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.480]   both now and forever. Amen.
