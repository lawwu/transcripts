[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.620]   There's a wonderful systematic review
[00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.440]   of a large number of studies
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.380]   that have looked at mental training and visualization,
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.640]   what's effective, what's less effective
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.320]   across a bunch of different disciplines
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.180]   that include education, medicine, music,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.680]   psychology, and sports.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.980]   We will provide a link to this paper
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.840]   in the show note captions,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.000]   but the title of the paper is
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   "Best Practice for Motor Imagery,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.140]   a Systematic Literature Review
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.860]   on Motor Imagery Training Elements
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.420]   in Five Different Disciplines."
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.440]   As the title suggests,
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.800]   it's mainly for motor imagery training,
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.880]   but it extends into music,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120]   which of course involves motor training and execution,
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.180]   but as well as education.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.520]   This review establishes a number
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.400]   of different important things.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.920]   I'm going to read off some of the key
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.800]   or highlight takeaways.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   For instance, I described principle one
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.560]   of effective mental training and visualization,
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.040]   which is that the visualization be brief
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.880]   and it be simple and it be repeated.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880]   You may ask how many times
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.040]   that very brief five to 15 second exercise
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.620]   of going through some routine should be repeated.
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.080]   Well, different studies have used different ranges
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.540]   of let's call them repetitions in a given training session,
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.420]   but the number that seems to be most effective
[00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.360]   is somewhere between 50 and 75 repeats per session.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360]   That brings about the question
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.440]   of how long one should rest between each repeat.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.360]   This gets a little tricky
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.600]   depending on what you're trying to do.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.720]   Remember that we have this kind of threshold
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.700]   of about 15 seconds for completion
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.100]   of the entire motor sequence.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.340]   Let's say what you're trying to do,
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.740]   like a golf swing takes you five seconds
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.400]   to imagine in your mind's eye from the point where you,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   let's just say, have the ball on the tee,
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.900]   you bring the golf club up,
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.560]   you might reposition your feet just a little bit,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   you know, that kind of little wiggle that golfers do,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.900]   and then the swing.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.960]   If that whole thing takes five seconds in your mind's eye
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.240]   and roughly five seconds in the real world,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   well, then you'd be able to repeat it, of course,
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.660]   three times in 15 seconds.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.640]   That would be one repetition,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.080]   even though you're doing it three times.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.360]   So it's one 15 second epoch, as it's sometimes called,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200]   E-P-O-C-H, epoch.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.500]   And then you would rest
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.800]   for an approximately equivalent amount of time,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.880]   15 seconds or so, and then repeat.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.500]   And rest 15 seconds or so, and then repeat.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.480]   Rest 15 seconds, and then repeat.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.040]   Again, three golf swings within that 15 seconds,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.960]   rest 15 seconds.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   Three golf swings within that 15 seconds, rest 15 seconds.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.280]   Truth told, these epochs and these rest periods
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.780]   do not need to be exact.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.400]   You could imagine, for instance,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.580]   that you get three repetitions of the swing
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.120]   within 14 seconds.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.300]   Well, then do you do another one
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120]   or do you wait until the end of that 15 seconds?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   I encourage you not to obsess too much
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.960]   about those sorts of points.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   Rather, you want to do as many repeats as you can
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.600]   in about a 15 second epoch,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.680]   and then rest for about 15 seconds,
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.640]   and then repeat for a total of 50 to 75 repetitions.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.400]   Which might not sound like a lot to some of you,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   might sound like an awful lot to others of you.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.840]   To me, it sounds like a lot.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.400]   You know, 50 repetitions of something
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   and where you're trying to concentrate in your mind's eye
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.880]   on getting something accomplished over and over and over again
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   in exactly the same way, might seem like a lot.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.380]   We know, based on the learning literature,
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.040]   that your ability to successfully perform something
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.720]   in the real world will lend itself to better performance
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.560]   of that thing in the imagined world within your mind's eye.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.520]   That's also one of these sort of does.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   But if you're trying to get better at something
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   that you've never performed before,
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.080]   you really should know that.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.720]   The mental training visualization
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.640]   is probably not the best augment to that real world training
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.400]   until you're able to perform it successfully
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.500]   in the real world at least some of the time.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.080]   Mental training visualization can be effective, however,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.760]   at increasing the accuracy or the frequency
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.880]   which you can do that real world behavior.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   So if normally you're only getting the correct swing
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.200]   or you're only hitting the golf ball correctly,
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.360]   say 10% of the time mental training and visualization
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.480]   can really help bring that number up.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.800]   But it is important that you are able to successfully
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.760]   complete that motor task in the real world.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.320]   Similarly for performance of cognitive tasks.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.520]   So say for instance, speaking a new language,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   you might ask, well, gosh, what in the landscape
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.420]   of speaking a new language can be restricted
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.520]   to five to 15 seconds where I could repeat it
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.960]   anywhere from one to three times in a given epoch
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.320]   and then rest and then keep repeating 50 to 75 times.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.560]   Well, there I would encourage you to pick something
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200]   that you are able to do perhaps very slowly.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.960]   So to speak a particular sentence,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.640]   but with some challenge in getting the accent
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.880]   and the enunciation right,
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.480]   but you've completed it successfully before
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.080]   and you want to get more smooth or more fluid with it.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.040]   Likewise for playing piano or guitar.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   Again, you have to translate to the specific cognitive
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.880]   and or motor activity that you are seeking to improve at.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.720]   But those epochs lasting five to 15 seconds
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.280]   are really the cornerstone of an effective mental training
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.440]   and visualization practice.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   And the repeated nature of it 50 to 75 repetitions
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.060]   in a given session is also another cornerstone
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.960]   of an effective mental training and visualization practice.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.520]   So says this review and some of the other papers
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.840]   that I'm going to get to in a few moments.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.700]   Now, one of the other key components
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.520]   of a successful mental training and visualization practice
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.240]   is how often you perform that mental training
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.680]   and visualization practice.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.440]   And again, a number of different studies
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.960]   have looked at this through a number of different lenses,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.580]   meaning anywhere from two to eight times per week.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.680]   It does appear that performing these sessions
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.040]   anywhere from three to five times per week
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.700]   is going to be effective.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.400]   We could perhaps even say most effective
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   because most of the, let's just call it the strongest data
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.840]   really point to repeating these 50 to 75 trials
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.400]   of the same thing three to five times per week.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.280]   So you can come up with a number
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.680]   that's reasonable for you to do consistently.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.120]   And you might ask, do you have to continue
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.240]   to perform the mental training and visualization forever?
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.340]   And the good news is the answer to that question is no.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.560]   It does seem that once you have what's called consolidated
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.080]   the motor performance or the cognitive performance
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.040]   of something, it can be further supported or reinforced.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.560]   That is consolidated in the neural circuits
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.120]   that are responsible for performing
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.360]   that mental or physical task.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.340]   So in other words, once you are performing
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.320]   that cognitive or motor task in a way that's satisfactory
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.360]   or perhaps just improved, perhaps you're not 100%,
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.160]   but it's improved in the real world,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.360]   you don't need to continue to do mental training
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.380]   and visualization to maintain that real world performance.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.220]   So that's a good thing.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.900]   In fact, the ideal situation would be
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.640]   then to pick a different sequence
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   or thing that you're trying to learn
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.420]   and do mental training and visualization for that.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.560]   I perhaps might've misspoke there,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.480]   although I don't want to edit this out.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   I misspoke in the sense that, again, I said,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.440]   for the thing that you're trying to learn,
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.480]   remember mental training and visualization
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.920]   is going to be most effective for building up
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.200]   the number of accurate trials
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.640]   or your ability to do something with a greater frequency
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.720]   of something that you're already capable of doing
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.220]   or have done at least once in the real world, okay?
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.360]   This is not to say that mental training and visualization
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.520]   can't be used to acquire new skills.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.080]   It can in principle,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.280]   but it has been shown to be most effective
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.200]   for enhancing the speed and the accuracy of skills
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.800]   that one has already demonstrated some degree
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.160]   of proficiency at in the real world.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.000]   I think that's important to point out
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.680]   because we often hear mental training visualization
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   and this equivalence of perceptual and motor experiences
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.600]   in our mind's eye to the real world.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.880]   And we think, oh, all we have to do
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.960]   is imagine doing something and we will get better at it.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.680]   And unfortunately, that's not the case.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.260]   The good news is, however, if you can do something once,
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.280]   even very slowly in the real world,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.460]   and then you bring it to the mental imagery
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.640]   and visualization domain,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.800]   you can get much faster at it
