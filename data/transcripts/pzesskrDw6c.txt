[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   [Music]
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.000]   Pastor John, you said humans do not have free will, as in having ultimate self-determination
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.960]   in choosing Christ. That was last time in episode 307. And so if there is no free will
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.940]   in this sense, and therefore God is the ultimate determining cause that finally decides my
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.000]   choice of Christ, then how are sinners held accountable for what they cannot do?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.500]   Right. So we saw last time from Romans 8, 7 and 1 Corinthians 2, 14, we cannot, we don't
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.040]   have the moral ability to grasp and submit to God's will in Christ. We don't have the
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.400]   ability to see him as beautiful. He is not compelling to us. We are spiritually blind,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.040]   and can we then be held accountable? That's the question now. The Bible says that we are
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.760]   accountable for what we can't do in this regard. And so what we're really asking is, is there
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.600]   a way to understand that? I mean, clearly we are accountable, and clearly we can't come
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.160]   up with the kind of freedom we have to have in order to embrace Christ as compelling.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   That's the question. And I think there is some help in the Bible for understanding how
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.800]   this works. In Romans 1, 18, it goes like this, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.120]   the truth." So that's what we do. We suppress the truth. "For what can be known about God
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.600]   is plain to them because God has shown it to them." So everybody knows God. Everybody
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:02.040]   has seen God and knows God. Verse 20, "Therefore, so they are without excuse, for although they
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.440]   knew God, they did not honor him as God or give him thanks." So, I mean, that word "therefore"
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.320]   is theologically really packed. "Therefore, they are without excuse." Therefore, they
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.800]   are responsible for suppressing the truth. So the Bible does address the terms of accountability.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.120]   There's something before that "therefore." What are they? Well, here's what it appears
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.800]   from the text. You must have access to knowledge you're expected to respond to. "Therefore."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.680]   They have that knowledge, therefore they are without excuse. If you didn't have the knowledge,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.480]   you would have an excuse, evidently, because they know about God. They are without excuse
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.840]   when they don't worship him. And the second thing is, and this is implied, I think, in
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   the first, the mental or the natural ability to know him. If you don't have a brain, it
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.560]   doesn't make any sense to say you're responsible to know him. So an infant, for example, would
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.360]   seem not to fit this criteria. A little tiny infant who doesn't have the mental capacities
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   to fulfill the criteria of being without excuse, namely, or being with excuse, namely to see
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.520]   and know God. So from this and other texts, Jonathan Edwards and others pointed out that
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:32.160]   there's a kind of inability that excuses us, and there's a kind of inability, a kind of
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:41.400]   can't, bondage, that doesn't excuse us. And he called the one that excuses us natural
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.760]   inability and the other one moral inability. So let me try to unpack that. Natural inability
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.060]   means that you can't do what you most deeply will to do. If that happens, you're not responsible
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.160]   for doing it. If you're a quadriplegic, lying on the floor and are told to get up with no
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.840]   help, you're not responsible to. But if you are lying on the floor because you love lying
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.320]   on the floor so much, you love it so much that you can't even want to stand up, you
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:32.080]   are responsible. In other words, there is a real can't, a real moral can't that leaves
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:40.840]   you still responsible. Disliking something so much we can't do it, that leaves us responsible.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.080]   That's the kind of can't in the Bible that says we can't come to Christ, we can't submit
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.880]   to Christ, we can't receive Him as our treasure—not because we're chained physically, but because
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.680]   we are morally corrupt and dark and rebellious, and we love, we love darkness rather than
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.280]   light so that we can't come to the light, which is why the grace of God is so precious
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.320]   and so necessary, overcoming our blindness, overcoming our hardness of heart that keeps
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:23.280]   us from seeing Jesus as beautiful. So that's what the new birth is. In the new birth, the
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.360]   wind blows where it wishes, you hear the sound of it, you don't know where it comes from
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.920]   or where it's going, so is everyone who's born in the Spirit. You don't make the new
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.000]   birth happen. The Holy Spirit blows over you, and suddenly you are rational, you're seeing
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.080]   Christ is beautiful, heaven is bright, hell is horrible, the way of salvation is glorious,
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:53.760]   and you believe. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. We have
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.520]   to have Jesus overcoming this bondage to sin that we've been in all our lives. When we
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.640]   were blind, here's what happened. God who said—this is 2 Corinthians 4:6—God who
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.440]   of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. Suddenly, by the new birth,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.160]   by this divine call of God into our lives, "Let there be light," we see for the first
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.960]   time Christ in a compelling way, and thus freely act rationally for the first time in
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.640]   our life and embrace the one who is infinitely glorious.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:41.680]   So maybe next time we could turn to what this freedom is like, but the point here is, yes,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:49.200]   we are responsible, and yes, we are in bondage, because our bondage is a moral bondage, not
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   a physical one.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.040]   Yes, so we'll go ahead and stop here for now, but let's pick up this topic of Christian
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.720]   freedom on Monday. Thank you, listeners, for all the questions related to free will that
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.240]   have been sent in over the months. If you'd like to ask Pastor John a question about the
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.400]   Bible, theology, Christian living, sports, or anything else on your mind, please send
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.960]   us your questions via email at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend.
