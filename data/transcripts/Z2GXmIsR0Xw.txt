[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620]   And then another one that I think a lot of people don't always think about is the flexibility around when you can lock in the trip.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.540]   I know a lot of people who say, well, I want to go to Europe and I want to go this week.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.320]   And in fact, I really want to go to Paris.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   And I say, well, the one piece of flexibility it sounds like maybe you could have is when you book the trip.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.860]   Because if you wait till the last minute, you might get a really amazing deal.
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.800]   Or if you can plan it over a year in advance, you might get the best deal.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:36.020]   So deciding when you're going to be able to book that trip is another form of flexibility because the average traveler is looking to book a trip somewhere around, I think, three to four months out.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:48.660]   So if you can deviate from that and book it a year out, or if you're comfortable waiting until two weeks out, things open up so drastically in that last two week window that I would argue that that's kind of the best time to buy.
