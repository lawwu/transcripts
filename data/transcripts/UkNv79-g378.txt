[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   the epistle of Paul to the Romans, the eighth chapter, verses 15, 16 and 17.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.840]   Verses 15, 16 and 17 in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.040]   "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.920]   of adoption, whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, and
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.200]   if children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.040]   If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.400]   Now, no greater words than those have ever been written.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:04.280]   They stand out even in a great chapter as an expression of truth, which is quite unique.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.600]   It is one of the most magnificent statements that is found anywhere in the whole realm
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.080]   and range of the Scriptures.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.080]   And yet, there is nothing more important about a statement like that than that we should
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.280]   realize exactly why it was the apostle ever made it.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.360]   The danger with some of these resounding phrases is that we tend to contempt ourselves with
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.040]   the words or with some general impression.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.520]   We enjoy them so much that we don't realize their significance, and therefore we don't
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.960]   truly appropriate to ourselves the teaching which they are meant to convey.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   Now, take this great statement, why did Paul ever say it?
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240]   What was his object?
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.280]   What was his reason for doing so?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.160]   Well, the answer to the question, of course, is given at once by the first word in that
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.360]   fifteenth verse which I read, "for."
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.100]   "For," says the apostle, "ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear."
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.520]   In other words, he is linking it up with something that has gone before.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.760]   In other words, he has a very definite objective in view in writing these words, and that is
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.900]   that he is anxious to save these Roman Christians from a spirit of discouragement or from a
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.420]   spirit of despondency or of depression.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.860]   They may have actually been suffering from that, but even if they were not, he at any
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.300]   rate is concerned that they should not be suffering from it.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.780]   And his one object is to provide them with an antidote against this depression, this
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:05.100]   spirit of bondage, this spirit of defeat, this spirit of discouragement that is always
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.780]   threatening us as we've been seeing on a number of Sunday mornings now in this Christian
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.700]   life.
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.260]   In other words, the apostle doesn't throw out a magnificent statement like this without
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.260]   any connection.
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.380]   It isn't simply some wonderful truth that is suddenly uttered.
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.300]   No, it comes in, as is almost invariably the case with this great apostle, it comes in
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.420]   as he is dealing with a very practical problem.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.580]   These epistles which we have in the New Testament are full of doctrine and they're full of
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.700]   theology, and yet it would be very wrong indeed to say that a collection of New Testament
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.500]   epistles is a textbook of theology.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.140]   It isn't.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.940]   The astounding thing is this, and it's so important to bear it in mind, that these magnificent
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.660]   pronouncements on doctrine have always been introduced with this practical object in view,
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.700]   with this didactic element right in the very forefront.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.420]   These letters are pastoral letters primarily.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.140]   The apostle was concerned to help people in the actual enjoyment and outliving of the
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.900]   Christian faith which they had believed and had accepted.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.340]   Now therefore I say that it is very important to notice exactly how it is he came to make
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340]   this particular statement.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.180]   What was the cause of this discouragement?
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.620]   Well, we can put it like this in a phrase, it is nothing but the problem of living the
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.140]   Christian life.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.580]   The problem, if you like, of dealing with sin.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.500]   He's been dealing with that problem in reality from the beginning of the sixth chapter of
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.220]   this mighty epistle, and here he is still dealing with it.
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.860]   Here are men and women who have been converted and have believed in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.220]   but they're up against the problem now of living this life which they have received
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.160]   in a world that is antagonistic and is utterly opposed to them.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.380]   They have to live it also in the light of certain things that are true of themselves
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.060]   and within their own nature.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.380]   It's a battle, it's a fight.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.060]   There is sin, I say, without and within, and here are people who are now concerned
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.820]   about following the Lord Jesus Christ and living their lives as he lived his life in
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.940]   this world.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.180]   And it is very often face to face with that particular question and problem that this
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.580]   discouragement and depression tends to come in.
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.180]   We've already had innumerable examples of the various ways in which the devil in his
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.980]   subtlety comes to us and discourages us.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.300]   And this again is a very common one, and especially with certain types of persons, particularly
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.780]   the conscientious type of person, that type of person who takes the Christian faith very
[00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.500]   seriously, the type of person who doesn't say, "Ah, well, I'm converted and now all
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.740]   is well and I simply recline for the rest."
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.860]   No, no, the kind of person who says, "But this is a great and a glorious life and I
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.860]   must live it."
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.860]   Now, it's the peculiar temptation that comes to such people.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.820]   And there are many such at the present time.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.940]   And there are many people in the Christian life who are discouraged and who suffer from
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.300]   this kind of spiritual depression for this particular reason.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.420]   Now, what is the essence of this problem?
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.500]   Well, the essence of the problem is this.
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:58.380]   It is a failure on their part to realize the truth concerning the Christian life.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.540]   It is their failure to realize what is possible for us as Christians.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.420]   It is ultimately a failure to understand the doctrine.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.820]   I'm going to try to show you that.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.260]   Or if you prefer it, we can even put it like this.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.980]   It is ultimately another failure in the realm of faith.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.300]   We have seen a number of things about faith recently on Sunday mornings.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.980]   We've seen that it's got to be an activity and that many people forget that and get into
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:34.300]   trouble because they don't realize that they've got to apply their faith.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.220]   Then we saw last Sunday that others get into trouble because they don't see that they've
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.260]   got to continue in the application of their faith.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.060]   But it isn't enough to start, you've got to go on, and that you can't relax for a
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.060]   moment.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:57.140]   Now, here the difficulty seems to be the difficulty of failing to realize that faith must appropriate.
[00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.020]   Here is the truth set down before us.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.580]   Yes, but if we don't appropriate it, it won't help us.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.940]   And this is, to me, always one of the most remarkable things about men as the result
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.100]   of sin.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.620]   We all must have noticed it, we all must have had this experience many times.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.500]   Haven't you read again the scriptures, which you've read many and many a time, and which
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.780]   you thought you knew, and suddenly you find it becomes alive to you and speaks to you
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.140]   in a way that it has never done before?
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:32.460]   How easy it is to read the scriptures and to give a kind of nodding assent to the truth
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.580]   and yet never really appropriate what it tells us.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.660]   Now I believe that that is of the very essence of this particular problem that we're looking
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.580]   at together this morning.
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.180]   And of course, the result of all this is that it tends to produce what the apostle here
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.860]   calls a spirit of bondage.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:00.180]   "God," he says, "you have not received again a spirit of bondage to fear."
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.980]   And what does he mean by this spirit of bondage?
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:12.260]   Well, we can put it like this, he means that it's the danger of having a servant spirit,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:16.860]   the serf-like spirit and attitude.
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.140]   Now the causes of this, I think, are something like this.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:28.060]   This servant attitude generally arises from the tendency to turn the Christian life and
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:35.340]   the living of the Christian life into a new law and into a higher law.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.060]   In other words, I'm thinking of people now who are quite clear about their relationship
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.540]   to the old law, as it were, the Ten Commandments and the moral law.
[00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.620]   They have seen very clearly that Christ has delivered them from that and that he alone
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.060]   can do so.
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.180]   That all their own efforts would never enable them to fulfil the law.
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.260]   They say Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.020]   They are quite clear about their justification.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.500]   But they get into trouble in this way.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.820]   They now begin to look positively at the Christian life, and in a very subtle way and quite unconsciously
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:20.420]   to themselves, they turn that into a new kind of law, a higher law.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.820]   And the result of that is that they get into a kind of spirit of bondage and of serfdom.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:32.900]   They think of it as a great task that they've got to take up, and to which now they are
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.900]   to apply themselves.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.820]   They've read the Sermon on the Mount, and they say, "Now that's the Christian life.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.900]   That's the life that I'm meant to be living.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.980]   That's the life that I want to be living."
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.420]   They read the other teaching of our Lord that is recorded in the Gospels, and they say,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   "Now that's the Christian life."
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.420]   They then go through these various epistles, and they see these detailed injunctions and
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.420]   regulations that are given by the apostles, negatively and positively, and they say, "Now
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.060]   that's the Christian life."
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:08.260]   And having thus faced it, and having admired it, they regard it as something that they've
[00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.260]   got to take up, and which they now have to put in practice in their daily life and living.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:21.340]   In other words, holiness becomes a great task to them, and they begin to plan and to organize
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:26.740]   their lives and to introduce certain disciplines in order to enable them to do so.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.860]   Now, of course, this has been done in a classical manner by the Roman Catholic Church.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.820]   Their whole idea of monasticism is just a great exhibition of the very thing to which
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.820]   I'm referring.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:47.820]   Now, there are men and women who, having understood this Christian truth, they say, "Well, now,
[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:54.220]   the Christian life is a high and an exalted life, and if anybody is to live that life
[00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.820]   successfully, it's a whole time matter."
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.540]   They said, "You can't do that and stay in business, or stay in the world in some profession
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.620]   or avocation.
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.820]   You must segregate yourself from the world.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.820]   You must go out of the world."
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.820]   And they did.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.660]   They gave up everything, and they still do it.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.220]   Now, that is the idea that I'm trying to put to you.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:21.860]   This idea that holiness, the cultivation of holiness and of the spiritual life, is a whole
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:29.020]   time occupation, and that you must plan and organize your life, and you have your rules,
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.620]   and you know those various orders all have their own special rules.
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:39.540]   The order of Benedict and various others, varying in their strictness.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:46.620]   Now, the idea behind all that I say is that to live this Christian life and to practice
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:52.660]   it truly, you must give to yourself to it in that way, and discipline your life in that
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.660]   kind of manner.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:59.260]   Now, that, according to the Apostle Paul, is nothing but a spirit of bondage.
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.100]   I need scarcely point out that this is not confined to the Roman Catholics.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.740]   It isn't confined even to others who call themselves Catholic.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.220]   It can be quite common amongst evangelical Christians, and is quite common amongst evangelical
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.720]   Christians.
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.700]   We impose upon ourselves a new law.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.540]   Now, we don't call it law, of course.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.380]   If we realized that it was putting ourselves under the law, we wouldn't do it.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.900]   But there is a tendency to do it.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.700]   Now, I can prove that to you by the frequent references which are made to this in the various
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.220]   New Testament epistles.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:40.940]   Take for instance Paul's argument and writing in the epistle to the Colossians, where he
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.900]   has a very specific passage dealing with this.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.340]   Listen to him putting it like this.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.260]   "Let no man therefore judge you," he says, "in meat or in drink or in respect of unholy
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:58.140]   day or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come but the
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.020]   bodies of Christ.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:06.420]   Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.140]   intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up in his fleshly
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.860]   mind and not holding the head," and so on.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.180]   "Wherefore," he says, "if he be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.740]   as though living in the world are he subject to ordinances, touch not, taste not, handle
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.980]   not, which are all to perish with the using, after the commandments and the doctrines of
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:35.380]   men, which things indeed have a show of wisdom in will-worship and humility and neglecting
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.060]   of the body, not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.100]   Now, you see, this was attacking the early church.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.700]   It was coming in in a kind of incipient manner, this kind of glasticism.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.580]   Now, it's no longer present amongst us in that particular form, but the tendency, the
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.420]   temptation is still there.
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.260]   And again, Paul, in writing to Timothy, you remember, has to warn him against exactly
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.580]   the same thing.
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:10.700]   This kind of new law that is being imposed upon Christian people, listen to it in 1 Timothy
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.700]   4.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.660]   "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:22.540]   faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy,
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.660]   having their conscience seared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:33.880]   to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.380]   believe and know the truth."
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:41.140]   Now, that, I say, is something which is quite common.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:49.620]   I remember very well the case of a thoroughly evangelical Christian lady who had ceased
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:56.620]   to eat meat because she believed that she could demonstrate quite clearly that a Christian
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.020]   should not eat meat for this reason, that to eat meat meant that an animal had first
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.780]   of all been killed, and that was cruelty, and that was a violation of the spirit of
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   love.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.180]   Now there, you see, was a lady who had imposed upon herself a law.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.180]   What was her object?
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.180]   Her object was to live the Christian life truly.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.620]   She took her Christianity very seriously.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.180]   She was an evangelical Christian, I say, quite clear about justification by faith, but unconsciously
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.060]   she had turned the Christian life and the living of the Christian life into a new law
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.340]   which she had imposed upon herself.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.660]   And I refer to that passage which I have just read to you, "These seducing spirits that
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.740]   forbid to marry and forbid to eat meats."
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:46.340]   Now, that's sufficient perhaps to show what the apostle means by this spirit of bondage
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:54.900]   against fear, and to interpret this in terms of certain things which are to be seen in
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.260]   the city of London and in this country generally at the present time, this tendency to impose
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.980]   new laws on Christian people.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.820]   Later on in this self-same series, God willing, I hope to come back and to deal with it a
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.260]   little more specifically.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.420]   But here it is in principle.
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.380]   Now then, that's the spirit of bondage, and that of course always brings with it and in
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.620]   its train a spirit of fear.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.180]   God hath not given us the spirit of bondage, says Paul in the same sort of passage in writing
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.180]   to the Galatians.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:30.460]   Here he puts it, "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear."
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.300]   Well, in what sense does this produce a spirit of fear?
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.900]   Well, in this way.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.500]   It tends to produce a wrong fear of God.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.420]   Now there is a right fear of God, and we neglect and ignore that at our peril, as I hope to
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.140]   be showing tonight.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.460]   But there is a wrong fear of God, and that is a craven fear of God.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.700]   The fear, as John puts it, that hath torment.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:05.460]   Now these people, I say, tend to develop this kind of wrong fear.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.860]   They regard God as a taskmaster.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.820]   They regard God as someone who is constantly, as it were, waiting to discover these faults
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.980]   and blemishes in them, and to punish them accordingly.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.860]   And having turned the Christian life in this way into a law, God is somehow banished by
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.580]   them to some far distance.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.660]   It's so obviously true of that Catholic tendency to which I've already referred.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.860]   It's true in every manifestation of this particular spirit.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:46.660]   God is someone far away in the distance, and primarily the great lawgiver only.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.140]   But it's not only a fear of God, it's also a fear of the greatness of the task.
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:19:00.420]   Having outlined the task to themselves in this way, they now begin to fear this task.
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.980]   That is why I say they say that it can only be lived if one segregates oneself from the
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   world.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.900]   They've got such a conception of it as to bring them to the conclusion, they say,
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.740]   "A man can't possibly be in business, or following his profession, and do all this.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.180]   My business takes my time, I'm engaged in my profession, not only during the hours I'm
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.100]   in my office, but before I go and after I go, I can never catch up with this work.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.560]   How can I possibly live this Christian life?"
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.180]   And there it becomes a kind of dread and terror.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.660]   They're afraid of it.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.900]   That's their attitude towards the Christian life.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:40.260]   They have no joy in it, because the gigantic size of the task is something that fills them
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.660]   with a spirit of fear.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.700]   And they're in trouble about themselves and the possibility of ever really living this
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.240]   life as it should be lived.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.780]   And then another way in which it takes form, this spirit of fear, is that they tend to
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:01.660]   be afraid, likewise, in a wrong way, of the power of the devil.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.420]   Now I have to qualify every one of these statements.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.140]   There is a right fear of the devil.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:10.240]   You'll find that mentioned in the epistle of Jude.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.100]   You'll find it also in the second epistle of Peter.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.760]   There are flippant, ignorant people, spiritually, who speak evil of dignitaries.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:22.980]   They make jokes about the devil, simply because they're utterly ignorant.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.260]   "Oh, the devil is a mighty power."
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:32.620]   Yes, but again we must not be subject to a kind of craven fear of the devil.
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.620]   But these people are.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.340]   They're aware of his power.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.820]   You see, they're spiritually minded people.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.780]   This is the peculiar temptation of some of the best people.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.060]   They say, "There is this mighty power set against us."
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:50.100]   And they so concentrate on him and on that power that it becomes a spirit of fear and
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.580]   of torment.
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.940]   They scarcely know what to do.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.740]   They're so afraid of the power of the devil.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:03.260]   And then, of course, they're equally afraid of the sin that is within themselves.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:09.500]   They spend their time in denouncing themselves and in talking about the blackness and the
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.340]   darkness of their own hearts.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.740]   Again we must keep the balance.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.780]   A Christian who doesn't know his own sinfulness and the blackness of his own heart is the
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.340]   merest child in the Christian faith.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.260]   And indeed, unless he has some knowledge of it, I query whether he's in the Christian
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   faith at all.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:38.020]   People who are not aware of indwelling and inbred sin, clearly according to the scriptures,
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.740]   are either the merest tyrants or else they're unregenerate.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.820]   But that's a very different thing again from having this spirit of fear.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:56.900]   Of being in this condition in which they simply live a life of scorning delights and living
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.900]   laborious days.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.860]   Now, this, as I've often pointed out, is not so common today.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:11.340]   And I'm tempted to say, alas, because we modern Christians are much too healthy.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.780]   That's our peculiar problem.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.380]   We are much too healthy and light-hearted.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.140]   If you went back to the last century, and if you went back to the century before, and
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:26.340]   the century before that, you would find this other tendency, this tendency to be mourning,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.380]   and always mourning, and never rejoicing at all.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.820]   Indeed, some of them went so far as to say that if you did rejoice, there was something
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.820]   wrong with you.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:40.820]   Now, that again, I say, is to be guilty of the spirit of fear, because of an acute awareness
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:45.500]   of the power of indwelling sin.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.500]   In other words, I can sum it all up like this.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.940]   The spirit of fear in these people, which results from the spirit of bondage, is ultimately
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.940]   a fear of themselves and a fear of failure.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.420]   They say, "I've come into this Christian life."
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.780]   Yes, but the question is, can I live it?
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.940]   It's so marvelous, it's so wonderful, it's so high, it's so exalted.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.820]   Who am I to live such a life?
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.620]   How can I rise to such heights?
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.620]   And with this consciousness of their own weakness and sinfulness and the greatness of the task
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.900]   and the power of the devil, they, I say, enter into this spirit of bondage, and they're
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.540]   held down, and they're troubled, and they're worried, and they're full of fear.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.340]   Now, that's the condition.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.260]   And the Apostle Paul turns to such people and says, "You have not received the spirit
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.500]   of bondage again, to fear.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.100]   You were in that spirit of bondage and fear, but you've been brought out of that.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.380]   Why do you go back to that?"
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.340]   "Now, why is it they do go back?
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.340]   What's the antidote?
[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.340]   What's the answer?"
[00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.900]   Well, the Apostle gives an outline of that in this magnificent statement.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:53.100]   Now, the point I'm emphasizing is that it was all that that led Paul to make this statement.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.860]   He wasn't suddenly sitting in his room and didn't suddenly get the idea that we've
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.460]   got the spirit of adoption.
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.460]   Not at all.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.060]   He thought of it as he was reasoning out this case with these people as to how the Christian
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.540]   life is going to be lived.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.140]   That's exactly how he brings it in.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.140]   And what is the answer?
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:17.740]   The answer is, we must realize the truth concerning the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.580]   of the Holy Spirit within us.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.580]   That's the message.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:27.700]   Now, that, according to the Apostle, works out in two ways.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:35.740]   The first is this, that as I confront this mighty, glorious task of denying myself and
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:41.740]   taking up the cross and following the Lord Jesus Christ, as I realize that I'm to walk
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:48.660]   through this world as he walked, as I realize that I have been born again and fashioned
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.900]   by God according to the image of his dear Son, and I begin to ask, "Who am I?
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.380]   How can I do that?"
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.820]   Here's the answer.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.620]   The doctrine of the Holy Spirit, the truth that the Holy Spirit dwells within me.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.620]   What does it teach me?
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.900]   Well, it teaches me this first of all.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.260]   It reminds me of the power of the Holy Spirit that is within me.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   Now, the Apostle has already said that in verse 13.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.700]   You see, he says in verse 12, "Brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   the flesh."
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.020]   Well, the question is, "Then how can I stop living after the flesh?"
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.020]   Here's the answer.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:32.100]   "If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.940]   deeds of the body ye shall live."
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.140]   Now, he's referring back again to that with this "for."
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.700]   "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of adoption."
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:48.780]   He says, "The whole thing you must realize is that you're not left to yourselves.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.460]   You've been thinking," he says in effect to these Romans, "of this task of yours, as if
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.420]   there's that great Christian life and here am I.
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.460]   I'm forgiven, now thank God.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.500]   My sins are blotted out and washed away.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.220]   Yes, but I've got to live that Christian life."
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.700]   "If you think like that," says Paul, "well, it's not surprising you're in a spirit of
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.180]   fear and of bondage.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.580]   The whole thing is absolutely hopeless.
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.860]   That means that you've just got a new law which is infinitely more difficult than the
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.860]   old law."
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.660]   But that isn't the position.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.780]   The Holy Spirit dwells within you.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.540]   Now, he really has been dealing with this argument, has he not, right through this eighth
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   chapter.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.260]   Take what he says in the third verse, for instance.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:38.260]   He says, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh."
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.780]   God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.780]   flesh.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.580]   But what's he mean by that statement, "What the law could not do, in that it was weak
[00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.580]   through the flesh"?
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.580]   What's it mean?
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:53.980]   Well, of course, what he means by that is this.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:59.260]   The law, he says, couldn't save anybody, and the law couldn't enable anybody to live
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.140]   the Christian life for this reason.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.340]   That the law is weak because of the weakness of my flesh.
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:12.540]   What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.220]   Well, there's no flesh in the law, of course.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.940]   You can't talk about the weakness of the flesh of the law.
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.940]   What he means is this.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.580]   The law is given, but man, in and of himself, was asked to keep it.
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.420]   The weakness of the flesh is in the man, not in the law.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.420]   The law isn't weak.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:33.380]   It's the man who has to carry out the law that's weak.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.220]   I heard an old preacher putting that very well once.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.860]   He used this illustration.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.540]   He gave us a picture of a man digging a garden with a spade.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.940]   And as he kept on digging, the handle of the spade kept on breaking.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.380]   There was nothing wrong with the iron part of it.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.300]   The spade, as such, was all right, but the handle was too weak.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   The ground was pretty hard.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.060]   And there was this man doing his work, and the handle keeps on breaking.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.060]   That's it.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.420]   It's quite good.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.780]   The actual spade itself was all right, but you must have the right handle.
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.900]   Now man's ability is the handle, and it was too weak.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.700]   And therefore, salvation by the law is impossible.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.540]   Well, very well if we agree with that.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.820]   Isn't it equally true to say that if we impose upon ourselves the Christian life as a new
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:25.420]   law that you and I have got to keep in our own strength, we are doomed to the same failure.
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.260]   But we mustn't do that.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.860]   The spirit now dwells within us.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.540]   We are not in the flesh, says Paul, but in the spirit.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:38.500]   Didn't you notice how he argued all that out from verse 5 right until this verse 14?
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.820]   He keeps on saying that they that are in the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.220]   they that are in the spirit, the things of the spirit.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.980]   Then he turns to them and says, "But you are not in the flesh.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.600]   You are in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.080]   And then to make absolutely certain, he interjects in brackets, "Now if any man have not the
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.300]   spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.260]   He may think he's a Christian, but if he hasn't got the spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.020]   in him, he's not a Christian.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.740]   I don't care what experience he's had, if he hasn't got the spirit of Christ in him,
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.820]   he's not a Christian.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.420]   And he can't do any of these things.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.740]   But ye are not in the flesh.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:22.780]   You are in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.380]   And here he comes back to that same argument.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.700]   He said you needn't be in that spirit of bondage, you needn't be again in that spirit of fear.
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.700]   Why?
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:37.020]   Well, the Holy Spirit is in you, and he'll empower you and he'll strengthen you.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.740]   He'll nerve your feeble will and your feeble arm.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.820]   Oh, Paul is always repeating this.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.860]   Listen to him again in Philippians 2.13.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.700]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.620]   How little fear and trembling there is today.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.580]   We're all so healthy, as I've said.
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.340]   Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.420]   People don't fear at the point of conversion, and they don't fear afterwards, and they don't
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.980]   know the meaning of trembling.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:10.300]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you,
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.140]   both to will and to do."
[00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.300]   That's the spirit again.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.460]   And here is the way of getting rid of the spirit of bondage and that false spirit of
[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.100]   fear.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.220]   You notice the different fears again coming in.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.240]   It is to realize that the spirit of God is in us.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.760]   We must look to him.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.460]   We must seek his aid.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.900]   We must rely upon him.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.820]   That doesn't mean being passive and letting go.
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.820]   No, no.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.220]   It means that you believe this, that as you are exerting yourself, he's empowering you.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.740]   Indeed, you wouldn't have wanted to exert yourself unless he had first prompted you
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:43.740]   to do so.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.660]   He works in you, and you work it out.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.380]   That's it.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.380]   And as we realize this, the task is not impossible.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:59.460]   Paul in this parallel passage in the fourth of Galatians says there that God has sent
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.820]   into our hearts the spirit of his own Son.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.140]   Do we realize that, my friends?
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:13.860]   That as Christians, we have within us the selfsame Holy Spirit that was in the Son of
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.980]   God when he was here on earth.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.660]   The Father giveth not the spirit by measure unto him, says the third chapter of John's
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   Gospel.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:24.940]   Well, now then, it's the same spirit that is in him that is given to us.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.380]   The spirit that enabled him is the spirit that will enable us.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.340]   That's the first argument.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.620]   But let me hurry to the second argument.
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:41.620]   The presence of the Holy Spirit in us reminds us of our relationship to God.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.140]   This is the wonderful thing.
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:48.300]   He has not received the spirit of bondage against fear, but he has received the spirit
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:55.060]   of adoption, whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:00.900]   The presence of the Holy Spirit within us is a guarantee to us of our sonship.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.340]   Yes, our adult sonship, not infants.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.660]   This adoption means you're a grown son.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.660]   You've reached full age.
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:18.100]   You're a full son in the fullest sense and in the full possession of your position and
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100]   of your faculties.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:27.060]   Now, this is the thing that gets rid of the spirit of bondage against fear.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.100]   It doesn't do away with reverence and godly fear, remember, but it does away with the
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.420]   spirit of bondage and the spirit of fear.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.420]   How does it do it?
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:44.900]   Well, it enables us to see this, that our object now in living the Christian life is
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:51.260]   not simply to attain to a certain standard, but is rather to please God because he's our
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.580]   Father.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:01.220]   The spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.380]   A slave wasn't allowed to say, "Abba."
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.380]   And that slave spirit doesn't regard God as Father.
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.740]   It hasn't realized that he is Father.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:17.500]   It regards him still as a judge who is concerned about condemning us.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.980]   But that's wrong, my friends.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:27.660]   As Christian people, we must learn to appropriate by faith the fact that God is our Father.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.460]   Christ taught us to pray, "Our Father."
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.140]   This eternal, everlasting God has become our Father.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.620]   And the moment we realize that, everything tends to change.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:47.480]   He is a Father who desires our good and who is always caring for us.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.880]   He loves us with an everlasting love.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.740]   He has so loved us as to send his only begotten Son into the world for us and even to the
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.900]   cross to die for our sins.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.260]   That's our relationship to God.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.340]   And the moment we realize it, it transforms everything.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:08.300]   Henceforth my desire is not simply to keep a law, it's to please my Father.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.500]   We know something about that by nature, don't we?
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:19.740]   This filial love, this filial reverence, this filial fear, so different from that old fear.
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:23.580]   It's the desire to please your Father.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:28.100]   And the moment you grasp that, you lose the spirit of bondage.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.660]   It isn't a matter of rules and regulations any longer.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:36.020]   No, no, it's your desire to show him your gratitude to him for all that he's ever
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.900]   done for you.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.300]   And then the second thing.
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.020]   We are also sons, of course.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.660]   We say, "Abba, Father."
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:50.820]   The Spirit also beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:56.760]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.260]   You see the argument, you see the inevitable logic.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.300]   If we are children of God, we must be related to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   Yes, we are.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.780]   He is the firstborn amongst many brethren.
[00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.100]   He is our brother.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.860]   We are related to God in a sense as he was.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:17.820]   Have you ever noticed, I wonder, the amazing thing which John says in chapter 17, in verse
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820]   23, listen.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.660]   Our Lord's prayer, he's praying to the Father, he says, "I in them and thou in
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.820]   me, that they may be made perfect in one," listen to this, "and that the world may
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:40.660]   know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me."
[00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:50.140]   Our Lord says there that God the Father loves us as he loved him, the only begotten Son.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:57.940]   So I say we begin to realize this, that we are now sons of God, children of God.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:03.120]   This new dignity, this new standing, this new status, this glorious position in which
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   we find ourselves.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.480]   Oh, go back again to that same high priestly prayer, and this is how our Lord puts it.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.180]   He tells us that we are to glorify him in this world exactly in the same way as he glorified
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.180]   his Father.
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.980]   Have you realized that, my friend?
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.420]   That's the Christian life.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.380]   That's the reason for living the Christian life.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.060]   It isn't a question of looking at this great Christian life and quaking.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.780]   It's realizing this, I'm a child of God, I belong to Christ, I'm to glorify Christ.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   That's the way I look at it.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.280]   What a wonderful position, and the Spirit is in me, enabling me to do it.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.980]   It transforms my outlook.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:47.020]   I lose the spirit of bondage again to fear, and again I realize it in this way.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:50.780]   I realize that the Holy Spirit is dwelling within me.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:55.820]   That's Paul's famous argument, isn't it, in the sixth chapter of the first epistle
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:01.260]   to the Corinthians, "Know ye not that your bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost?"
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:08.420]   That's the way to overcome sins of the flesh, my friends.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.140]   Constantly am I having to answer this question.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.340]   People come to me and they say, "I've been praying about this."
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.140]   I can't, I can't stop it.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:19.860]   I say, "My friend, realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost."
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.940]   That's the answer.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:25.340]   I say it again at the risk of being misunderstood.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.620]   Such friends, in a way, need to pray less and to think more.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:36.220]   They must remind themselves that their bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.860]   in us.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.620]   Prayer is always essential, but thought is essential, because prayer can be an escape
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   mechanism.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.100]   It can be simply a resort of people who are desperate and defeated.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.860]   Prayer must be intelligent, and it is only to those who realize that their bodies are
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:05.140]   the temple of the Holy Ghost that the answer will be given and the power will come.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:10.460]   And then finally, of course, the Holy Spirit within us reminds us of our destiny.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   If children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.780]   That's the way to look at the Christian life.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.540]   Paul keeps on arguing about this.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.260]   He ends off by saying that this destiny of the Christian is absolutely certain.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:34.220]   He is persuaded, he is sure, it's beyond any doubt that neither principalities nor
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:39.020]   powers nor all the rest of them shall be able to separate us from the love of God which
[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.540]   is in Christ Jesus.
[00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:46.740]   It's not a question of keeping a standard or not a question of your vainly striving
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   to do something.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:55.300]   My friend, it's a question of getting ready for the place you're going to.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:39:01.020]   And the way to get rid of the spirit of bondage and of fear is this, is to know that if you're
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:07.260]   a child of God, you're destined for heaven and for glory.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.020]   And that all the things you see inside yourself and outside yourself can't prevent that plan
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:17.220]   from being carried out.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:20.780]   So I say it's a question of getting ready for that.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:26.180]   This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.260]   Faith in what?
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:30.980]   Faith of my ultimate destiny.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:36.620]   Or take it as John puts it in that same epistle, that first epistle of his in the third chapter.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.540]   We know not yet what we shall be.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.620]   Now are we the sons of God.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:47.140]   We know not yet what we shall be, but we know this, that we shall see him and see him as
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   he is.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:53.980]   And that when he appears, we shall be like him.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.980]   What does that lead to?
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:02.260]   It leads to this, every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.260]   is pure.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:10.300]   Oh, there is nothing that is so calculated to promote holiness within us as the realization
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:17.540]   that we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, that our destiny is certain and secure,
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:24.260]   that nothing can prevent our getting there, and we purge and purify ourselves, even as
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.340]   he is pure.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:28.820]   We say there's no time to waste.
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.940]   That's the apostle's argument in these three great verses.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.940]   And it was all, you see, practical.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.500]   How am I to live the Christian life?
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.780]   Well, that's the way.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.180]   Don't turn it into a law.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.220]   Realize that you've received the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.140]   There's the power.
[00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.620]   Then work out this argument.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.860]   Your father is watching you.
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.220]   He's looking at you.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.500]   Yes, let me use scriptural language.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:59.700]   He's jealous about you and your reputation because you belong to him.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.060]   You belong to Christ.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.740]   You're his brother.
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:11.420]   The Holy Spirit is dwelling in your very body, and you're destined for the glory.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.140]   Well, then what of it?
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.860]   Well, my conclusion is this.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:20.500]   I say with the men who wrote the hymn, unless it isn't in our new book, "Take my soul,
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.180]   thy full salvation.
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:28.580]   Rise o'er sin and fear and care.
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.780]   Joy to find in every station.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.460]   Something still to do or bear.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.180]   Think what spirit dwells within thee.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.020]   What a father's smile is thine.
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.500]   What a Savior died to win thee.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.580]   Child of heaven, shouldst thou repine?
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:56.260]   Oh, how wrong it is to be in a spirit of bondage again to fear.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.860]   Child of heaven, shouldst thou repine?
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.980]   No, no.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:06.460]   Think what spirit dwells within thee.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.460]   What a father's smile is thine.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.540]   What a Savior died to win thee.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:21.220]   Child of heaven, shouldst thou repine?
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.380]   No, no.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.300]   It's a good exposition of these three verses.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.940]   Lay hold of it.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   Appropriate it.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:29.940]   Practice it.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   Don't worry about what you feel.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   There's the truth about you if you're in Christ.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.460]   Rise to it.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:50.940]   O'er sin and fear and care, take your full salvation and triumph and prevail.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.540]   Amen.
