[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast. Pastor John, as you know,
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.520]   Scripture gives us pretty clear prohibitions around the Lord's Table, and given these parameters
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.960]   in the stern warning passages of the New Testament, a listener named Ruben writes in to ask this,
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   "Pastor John, how do I know if I'm holy enough for the Lord's Supper? Under what circumstances
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.120]   would a professing Christian not participate in the Lord's Table?"
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.120]   Let me suggest three answers, or three kinds of answer based on three different passages. First,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.680]   you can know you shouldn't eat the Lord's Supper as a professing Christian
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.480]   if you've been excommunicated by your church. That's obvious. But he asked, "What are the
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.440]   situations?" And 1 Corinthians 5, 9 following say, "I wrote to you in my letter not to associate
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.960]   with sexually immoral people." Not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.280]   or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters, since you'd have to go out of the world.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.360]   But, "Now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother." Now,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.680]   that's what he asked about, "professing Christian." So here we have a professing Christian
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.120]   committing fornication, probably, somehow living in sexual immorality, or greed, or idolater,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:40.320]   or reviler, drunkard, swindler, not even to eat with such a one. So clearly they cannot be at
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.240]   the Lord's Table. So that's the first answer. If you've been excommunicated, you shouldn't eat
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.720]   the Lord—go down the street and eat the Lord's Supper at a loosey-goosey church. Number two.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.240]   Second answer is that a professing Christian shouldn't eat the Lord's Supper if he's
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:15.520]   presently at that moment of communion service unwilling to renounce Satan and sin and humbly
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.880]   hold fast to Jesus as his supreme treasure and only hope in this life and the next. And yes,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.680]   I am assuming that genuine Christians can have moments like this. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.480]   27—this is the key text—"Whoever therefore eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord in an
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.640]   unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord." So you don't want
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.760]   to do that. "Let a person examine himself then, and then so eat the bread and drink the cup.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.480]   For anyone who eats and drinks"—second phrase—"without discerning the body,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   eats and drinks judgment on himself." So now I don't think the phrase "in an unworthy manner"
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.720]   means we ever deserve the Lord's Supper, but that there's a fitness or suitableness
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.200]   between the Lord's Supper and our condition, and that fitness is not perfection on our part. Rather,
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.080]   it's a renunciation of sin and a making war on it, a renunciation of Satan, a hearty embrace
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.840]   of Jesus. That's the meaning of the Lord's Supper. The new covenant in the blood of Jesus is the
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.120]   forgiveness of sins. We heartily embrace Jesus as our substitute and our treasure and our sacrifice
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.920]   and our Lord. And the other phrase, "not discerning the body," may refer to the body of Jesus
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.960]   represented in the bread, or it may refer to the body of Christ as the people of God. In either
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:06.800]   case, the implication is that we're failing to see and act on the sanctifying implications of the
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   body of Christ for the body of Christ, and we're holding fast to some compromise with sin in the
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.160]   way we relate. If that's true, then we shouldn't eat. Well, what should we do? And that leads me
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.520]   to my last suggestion. Matthew 5:23. So, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there,
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.200]   remember that your brother has something against you. Leave your gift there before the altar and go.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   First be reconciled to your brother, then come and offer your gift. I think the clear implication is
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.640]   that if we find ourselves in a sinful relationship, holding fast to a sinful thought or a feeling or
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:02.560]   like a grudge, we should make reconciliation and sanctification a priority above eating the Lord's
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:10.160]   supper. Get things right, and then come and eat. Now, let me end like this. Having said all that,
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.000]   I want to avoid the terrible situation. I saw it in Germany when I was there. Forty years ago,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I saw 12 people taking the Lord's supper out of a parish of 10,000, and I asked the pastor,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.040]   "Where is everybody?" And he said, "There's a long tradition here of being afraid to eat the Lord's
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:36.560]   supper." In other words, I want to avoid the terrible situation in which we become so perfectionistic
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.680]   that we're afraid to eat the Lord's supper lest we bring condemnation on ourselves. Clearly,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.600]   the Apostle Paul knew that we're all sinners, and he intended for us to regularly eat the Lord's
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.320]   supper. So if we're members of a true church in good standing, and if we're not holding fast
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.280]   to known sin but are renouncing sin and hating it and fighting it and turning to Christ as our
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.920]   treasure and hope and substitute and punishment and righteousness, then we should eat.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.600]   Amen. What a story from Germany. Wow. Thank you for those three answers, Pastor John,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.840]   and thank you, Ruben, for the question. We really appreciate it. We return on Friday,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.760]   and a listener wants to know whether or not John the Baptist encouraged divorce in Matthew chapter
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.040]   14. It's an interesting story, and it's a question of its own that raises a lot of other questions
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.720]   that we'll need to raise first and find answers to. And we are going to do that next time on
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.640]   Friday. You've been listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime author and pastor
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.240]   John Piper. You can find our audio feeds and our archive, and like Ruben, you can send us a question
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.920]   of your own all at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn. I'm your host, Tony
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.400]   Rehnke. We'll see you on Friday. [End of Audio]
