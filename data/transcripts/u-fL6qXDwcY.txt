[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   In the following sermon that was preached on Sunday morning, the 22nd of September, 1957,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.720]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones is preaching from St. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians,
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.960]   chapter 1, verses 4 to 9.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.680]   I come back once more to this great statement here, at the beginning of this first epistle
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.160]   to the Corinthians, because it holds us, as I was indicating last Sunday morning,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.040]   face to face with some of those primary and foundation principles without which we cannot
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.880]   hope to live a full and a true and a successful Christian life. Nothing, indeed, is more important
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:52.400]   in the Christian life than to be certain of our foundation. There is no hope of development and
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.920]   of increase, there is no prospect of joy nor of happiness, unless we are truly on the right
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.360]   foundations. And that is why you will notice everywhere, always, in the epistles of the
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.680]   New Testament, that the writers invariably remind the people to whom they are writing
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:22.560]   of these things. Now, these letters were written with a specific object. Sometimes it was more or
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   less direct instruction, such as the epistle to the Romans. Here, the epistle was written because
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.200]   of a number of problems which had arisen in the church at Corinth, and with which the apostle
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.040]   has to deal. And it is so with other epistles. But always you find this, that before the writer
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.200]   gets down to the particular matters which produced a need for the letter, he invariably reminds them
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.840]   of certain things, certain basic foundation principles. And, of course, there is a very
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.120]   good reason for that. And it is this, that according to this truth, you can never understand
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.840]   a problem if you are not right about your first principles. Now, this is true not only, of course,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.520]   of the Christian faith, it is true of many a secular subject. For instance, anybody who has
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.640]   ever had to study any geometry knows that you always start with a number of axioms.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.880]   Certain axioms, certain things are axiomatic. You start with certain definitions,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.720]   and if you never grasp them, well, you will never understand the theorems to which you go on,
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.360]   and you will certainly never be able to solve a problem, or either.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.200]   It is essential that you know the principles, those axiomatic truths. You must know the
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   definition of a straight line. You must know various other definitions. If you haven't got
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.040]   them, well, you'll always be in a maze. Perhaps sometimes, more or less by accident, you'll be
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.480]   able to solve a problem. But if you really want to master the subject, you've got to start with
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.320]   the foundation principles. Now, all that is not only as true, but very much more true,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.280]   in the realm of the Christian faith and of the Christian life. So these writers
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.440]   start by laying them down. They know that most of the problems arise because people in various ways
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   have forgotten some foundational truth or principle. Now, take this letter to the Corinthians.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.560]   It's a perfect illustration of this very point I'm making. Look at their troubles. You remember
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   them, the divisions and scissors, the difficulty about the strong and the weak brother, the whole
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.720]   question of going to law, the way of behavior at the communion table, spiritual gifts, and so on.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.120]   What is the cause of all those problems? Well, it all comes back to this. These people
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.920]   had forgot some of the first principles. And what the apostle does when he comes to deal with the
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.840]   particular problems is to remind them of these foundation truths. There's nothing else to do.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   And so you will find as you work them out. Take, for instance, this question of Sism. How does he
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.320]   deal with that? Well, he deals with it by saying, "Is Christ divided?" In other words, he says,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.360]   "You are as you are because you are forgetting that the church's one foundation is Jesus Christ
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.400]   our Lord and nobody else." Now, it seems almost incredible, doesn't it? But that is always the
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.040]   difficulty. And when you come to the question of meat offered to idols, which was causing such
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.200]   trouble in the church, he says, "You mustn't do this sort of thing and offend your brother for
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   whom Christ died. It's your whole conception of the church that's wrong." And then when he comes
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   to the gifts, it's the same argument. Now, he says, summing it all up, "Ye are the body of Christ
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.280]   and members in particular. You're behaving," he says, "as if you'd forgotten him and as if the
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.680]   church were an institution which you've brought into being and which you were running and managing.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.320]   You are the body of Christ." In other words, all problems and difficulties ultimately arise
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   from some failure or another to understand or to apply foundation principles,
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:27.520]   these first elemental and elementary aspects of our faith. So, these men, in their wisdom and
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:34.480]   under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, are always very careful at the very beginning of their
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.800]   letters just to remind these people of them again. And of course, it's been necessary ever
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.400]   since in the history of the church. And it is as necessary today as it has ever been.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:53.840]   All the aberrations, all the confusions, all the problems and difficulties, they all emanate from
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.080]   just this. Very well, then. Now, we are watching the apostle as he does this in this particular
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   instance of the letter to the Corinthians. Now, last Sunday morning, we considered what is,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:15.600]   of course, the first principle, the foundation of it all. And that is that salvation is all together
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:27.840]   and entirely of God. God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:37.760]   Jesus Christ, our Lord. Oh, if the whole church but realized that as we saw,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.560]   and humbled itself and waited upon him and thanked him, what a difference there would be.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.920]   That's the first and the fundamental thing. But that isn't all, of course. That's the beginning.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.920]   That is, I say, the foundation of it all. Having looked at that, we must go on to the second thing
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.000]   to which the apostle directs attention. And that, of course, is this. How has God
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.920]   provided this salvation for his people? It's God who's provided it. It's God who thought about it.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.520]   It's God who's brought it into being. How has he done so? Now, it is essential, says the apostle,
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.200]   that you should be equally clear about this. It's all there in God. He's purposed it and
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.440]   brought it to pass. Well, how? Isn't that a very vital question? How does this become mine?
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.600]   And what does it do to me? What does it make of me? What does it mean to me?
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.520]   Well, once more, there is no question at all about this.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:45.120]   The apostle leaves us in no doubt or uncertainty whatsoever with respect to it.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.120]   And yet it's almost incredible to have to say it and to believe it, but it is the fact
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.840]   that there are large numbers of people who leave this out altogether.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:04.320]   What is this? What is this to which I'm referring? What is God's way of providing salvation? How has
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.920]   he done it? How does it come to us? What is it truly to be a Christian? Well, I say, the thing
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.720]   is here standing out before us. Yes, indeed, it stands out everywhere in the whole of the New
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:29.280]   Testament. It is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ. God the Father, yes, God the Son,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:39.760]   the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, I want to try to show you how amazing it is that anybody can forget
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.240]   this. And yet there are large numbers of people who go direct to God. The Lord Jesus Christ is
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.720]   not essential. He doesn't come in. They say, "Oh, God is the author of salvation. I go to God."
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:55.920]   But as the apostle emphasizes that it is indeed all of God, he is equally careful to emphasize
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.360]   that God gives it to us in and through and only in and through, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:11.280]   Look at him here, how careful he is to safeguard us against this danger. Have you noticed that in
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.120]   these first nine verses of this epistle, the Lord Jesus Christ is mentioned nine times?
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.680]   Now, this isn't accidental. The apostle was a very wise man. He was a very great teacher.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.840]   And he knew that all the troubles in Corinth were ultimately due to some forgetfulness of
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.760]   the Lord Jesus Christ. So he says, "Now then, Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.840]   unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus,
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:46.880]   called to be saints with all that in every place, call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.960]   both theirs and ours. Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.880]   Christ. I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:07.040]   Christ, that in everything ye are enriched by him, etc., even as the testimony of Christ
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:14.240]   was confirmed in you, so that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for what? Well, for the coming
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall confirm you, who being God, remember, shall also confirm you
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:30.640]   unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.440]   by whom ye were called unto," what? "unto the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord,
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.480]   nine times in the nine verses, the name Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ our Lord,
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.720]   his Son our Lord Jesus," and so on. And yet I say,
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:55.120]   there are so many who claim to be Christians who are Christless,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:02.720]   and this blessed name is never mentioned by them. They go to God, but Christ isn't there,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   and yet the apostle makes certain and sure that these Corinthians should ever have him at the
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.520]   center of their thinking and in their hearts. But you see, it's not only the apostle Paul,
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:19.040]   it's the whole of the New Testament. What's the first verse in the New Testament?
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:26.640]   Let me remind you of Matthew 1, 1, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.520]   It's the whole message of the book. It's the one theme. He is the center of all,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:44.000]   and there is no salvation apart from him. And so you will find, as you work through the New
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.080]   Testament, that everything that is said about the Christian, and to the Christian,
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:59.680]   and about the Christian church is always in terms of our relationship to God through and in
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:09.440]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Now, I confess that as I say all this,
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.160]   there is a sense in which I feel surely it's unnecessary to say anything like this,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.640]   but my dear friends, it is necessary. This is still the main cause of trouble in the Christian
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:29.040]   church, this astounding tendency to think even of Christianity apart from the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:37.360]   and his absolute centrality. So I conceive it to be a part of my call, while I have breath and power,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.200]   to go on repeating these things. I feel like the apostle Peter, who says, you remember,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.720]   in his second epistle, "While I'm in this tabernacle, I will go on repeating and reminding
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:57.920]   you of these things, because without this there is nothing." Very well, let me put it in this form.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.000]   What is a Christian? What is a Christian? Look at the way in which the apostle answers the question
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.480]   here. He's got three main things to say about a Christian, three main definitions, if you like,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:15.200]   of the Christian, or one definition with three aspects or prongs to it.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.880]   A Christian is a man who, first and foremost, has believed and received and is sure of
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:33.040]   the testimony of Christ. Verse 6, "Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you."
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:39.600]   A Christian is a man, I say, who has believed and received the testimony of Christ.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.560]   The second thing about him is this, that he is one who has been called into the fellowship of Christ.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.600]   And the third thing is that he is one who is waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.760]   Now, you notice that the three things are in terms of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.640]   You can't think of a Christian, you can't define him, except in terms of his peculiar relationship
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.160]   to this blessed person. Everything that's said about him is in terms of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:19.120]   Well, now let's look at them. Here is the first one, "Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:27.120]   in you." What does this mean? What does the apostle mean by talking about the testimony of Christ?
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:34.000]   This can be taken in two ways. There's been a great deal of disputation about it as to whether
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.440]   it's the one or the other, but I agree with those who would say, undoubtedly correctly, that it is
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.920]   a combination of both. The testimony of Christ. He says, "Now you people, you members of the
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:53.280]   church at Corinth, you Christians, what are you?" Well, you are what you are because the testimony
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.960]   of Christ has been confirmed in you. Testimony of Christ. Yes, well, first and foremost,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:08.160]   if you like, it is Christ's own testimony. It is the testimony, it was the witness that was born
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.400]   by the Lord Jesus Christ himself. And a Christian is a man who believes that and who accepts it,
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.560]   and whose life is molded upon that particular teaching and testimony.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.840]   Now, you remember how our Lord himself made this perfectly clear. You remember how towards the end
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:32.320]   of his life we are told in John 18 verse 37 that he said this, "To this end was I born,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:43.760]   and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth."
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   That's what is meant by his testimony. He came into the world in order to bear witness unto the
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:00.160]   truth, to give his witness, his testimony, to instruct and to teach, to give information,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.680]   to give light and knowledge. That is his purpose, he says, in coming into the world.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:11.360]   And a Christian is one who has believed and accepted this testimony of Christ.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:21.280]   What's it mean? Well, it means first and foremost, his testimony concerning God.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.600]   You remember how again John, in the prologue of his gospel, puts it, "No man hath seen God at any
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:35.120]   time, the only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him." He has come
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.840]   to reveal the Father. He has borne a testimony with regard to the Father. The Jews, while
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.720]   believing in God, in a sense, had gone wrong in their ideas of God, and their whole conception of
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:53.360]   God had become false. And he has come to call them back to a knowledge of the truth. God had
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.640]   already given it. He'd given it in the law, he'd given it in the prophets. But supremely, he has
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:05.920]   spoken to us in his Son. He has borne a witness and a testimony and has brought a revelation
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.760]   concerning God. So that a Christian is a man who thinks of God in terms of the teaching and the
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now apply that to the modern position,
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.200]   and you will see how important it is to bear this definition in mind.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.720]   Men have got their own ideas of God. They do not hesitate to say, "Now I say this, and God can't
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:36.000]   possibly do that, and God must be like this." That's philosophy, that's men's idea. That's not
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.360]   the revelation of Jesus Christ. "Ah," they say, "God is altogether love and tender, and God will
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.040]   never do such things." But you read what our Lord says about him. Read the testimony of Christ about
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:53.520]   God in the matter of judgment and things like that, and you will find some of the severest passages
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.800]   in the whole of the New Testament. The testimony of Christ concerning God. Yes, not only that,
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:07.360]   the testimony of Christ concerning the law of God. That's the whole object of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:13.840]   isn't it? Again, the Pharisees and others were giving a false interpretation of the law.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.520]   And our Lord has come to give the true interpretation of the law, the testimony of
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.080]   Christ with regard to the spirituality of the law. "You have heard," he says, "that it was said by
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.680]   them of old times, but I say unto you, the testimony of Christ." The law is not merely
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.240]   something that says, "Well, as long as you don't actually commit adultery, all is well." It says,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.360]   "You mustn't think of it, you mustn't fumble it, you mustn't look at a woman with lust.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.640]   It isn't enough that you don't murder your brother, you mustn't say, 'Thou fool,' about your brother."
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:49.200]   The testimony of Christ, the spirituality of the law. Now, the Christian is a man who believes
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.240]   this, he's accepted it. He has had the testimony of Christ confirmed to him. I don't stay with
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.920]   these, I'm simply giving you a summary. And then, of course, his testimony concerning himself.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:09.040]   And this is where we come to the crucial point. Who is a Christian? Well, a Christian is a man
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:17.520]   who has believed what this person has said about himself. Recall some of his own statements about
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:28.480]   himself. He says, "Before Abraham was, I am." Who is this? That was the question that people asked,
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:35.920]   "Who is this?" And it's still the most momentous question. Who is this? Is he but a carpenter from
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.520]   Nazareth? Is he but a man? Is he but a great religious genius? Is he but the supreme teacher?
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:48.560]   What is he? Is he but a moral exemplar? Who is this? That is always the question.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:57.680]   Who is the Christ? Who is this, the Son of God, the Son of Man? And those are his answers.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:09.360]   "The Father and I are one. No man knoweth the Father but the Son, and no man knoweth the Son
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.880]   but the Father, and him to whom the Father willeth to reveal him." Those are his terms.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:25.840]   All others, "I." "I and the Father are one." Now then, the Christian is a man, of course,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.760]   who has accepted and believed this particular testimony. You can't be a Christian without
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.800]   believing it. This question of the person of Christ is crucial. It's central. It's absolutely
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.200]   essential and vital. His person. And likewise, with regard to his work and the object of his
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.720]   coming. Listen to him. He stands there, this man who had lived and had worked as a carpenter,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:57.040]   and he says, "I am the light of the world." He says, "All who came before me were thieves and
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:09.520]   robbers. I am the door. I am the bread of life." These are his statements. These are his claims.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.080]   A Christian is a man who has believed this testimony, the testimony of Christ to himself
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:21.680]   and to the object and the purpose of his coming. But on he goes and he says something like this.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:34.240]   "The Son of Man," he says, "is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:44.320]   life a ransom for many." He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem. He said, "I must."
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:51.280]   They tried to dissuade him. He says, "I must." Why? Well, he has said this, "The Son of Man is
[00:21:51.280 --> 00:22:02.400]   come to seek and to save that which is lost." Now, here is his testimony. And at once I say,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.880]   we have to realize that the whole of Christianity turns around this very question. Do we believe
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:13.600]   his testimony? Do we accept it? Have we received it? Has it been confirmed to us? Are we absolutely
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.480]   sure and certain of it? Well, there it is. That's the first way of looking at it. Let me hurry to
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:25.440]   the second interpretation. The second interpretation of this phrase, "the testimony of Christ," is that
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:33.920]   it means the testimony which the apostles bore to him. Their testimony concerning Christ. Not
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.800]   the testimony given by Christ, but their testimony to Christ. Of course, in the end,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.840]   it comes to exactly the same thing. That's why I'm accepting both the possible interpretations.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.680]   Now, this, of course, was the very heart and center of their preaching.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:55.600]   Take this apostle Paul. He tells us in the very next chapter, in the second verse,
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.080]   he reminds these Corinthians, he says, "I determined not to know anything among you
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:13.520]   save Jesus Christ and him crucified." He reminds the Galatians that he placarded
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   Christ crucified before their eyes. Here is a man who deliberately refrains from speaking about other
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.440]   things, that he may speak only about Jesus Christ and him crucified. You know, he could have spoken
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.320]   about philosophy. He knew it. He'd been trained in it. He could have spoken to them about poetry.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   He was able to quote it when he wanted. He could have quoted, he could have spoken to them about
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.480]   their moral problems and difficulties. No man was ever in a better position to do so. He could
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.640]   have talked to them about a thousand and one things connected with religion. He says, "I didn't."
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.160]   "I determined not to know anything among you, Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.680]   He was a man with one theme, preached to one person, gave himself entirely and exclusively
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.040]   to this. He says, "I did this." He says, "I've got many other things to say." He says, "Howbeit
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.760]   we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world," and so on.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.880]   But he says, "I was with you and I was laying down foundations. I was bringing a church into being.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:20.000]   I didn't simply tell you to come to God. I told you that you can only come to God through Christ.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.080]   I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.680]   Why, well, he knows that you can't have a church apart from this. He knows that whatever might
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.400]   come into being, whatever kind of society or movement or institution, it cannot last,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.680]   and it will not be right in the sight of God, for Christ is the only foundation.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.960]   "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus."
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.640]   But it's the same with all of them. Look at the book of the Acts of the Apostles. What did those
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.320]   men preach? Jesus and the resurrection. What were these apostles? They are witnesses to the
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.720]   resurrection. "Stay in Jerusalem," says our Lord to them, "until ye be given power from on high,
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   and then ye shall be witnesses unto me." They were not sent around primarily to preach about
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.200]   God, as it were, and to preach morality and all these other... No, no. "Ye shall be witnesses
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:27.680]   unto me, that I am who I am, and who ye now know me to be, witnesses to me and to the resurrection."
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.880]   So the apostle Peter, in his sermon on the day of Pentecost, does nothing but expand
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.640]   the Old Testament Scriptures to show that he is the Son of God. Paul does it everywhere.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.440]   Take his great sermon in Antioch of Pisidia, recorded in the 13th chapter of Acts. It's the
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:50.240]   same thing. Here's the only theme, Jesus and the resurrection, that the Christ must needs have
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:57.200]   suffered, and that this Jesus which I preach unto you is the Christ, the testimony of Christ.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.800]   Well, what is all this? Well, fortunately for us, the apostle sums it up in his customary manner,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:13.120]   in one phrase. It's all in this ninth verse. "God is faithful, by whom ye were called
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:27.280]   into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord." Ah, this is the testimony of Christ.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:38.640]   "It is this testimony concerning him." Who is he? Well, it's here in two words.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:51.760]   His Son, God's Son. Yes, but also Jesus. There it is once and forever, the incarnation,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:03.360]   the virgin birth, the miracle of his person. Two natures in one person. Only one person?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:16.320]   His Son, God, Jesus, Son of Mary, man. Fully God, fully man. Two perfect natures,
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.920]   God and man, in one person, in one individual, unmixed.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:31.600]   Not two persons, but two natures in one person. And the apostle puts it here, you see,
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.280]   his Son, God, the God who is faithful, has sent his Son, Jesus.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   Oh, the folly of which we are all guilty. We are so immersed about our moods and states,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:50.160]   and thinking about them, and our problems. My dear friends, if only we could look at the mystery of
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.840]   the incarnation and contemplate the Son of God, they'd all be banished and we'd forget all about
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.920]   them. We spend our time turning in upon ourselves, feeling our spiritual pulse,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:06.160]   worried and troubled and talking to others. I say, here's the answer. Look at him, his Son, Jesus.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.000]   A Christian is a man who has believed and accepted this testimony,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.360]   that the Son of God has come down on earth. It's the whole message of the incarnation, I say,
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.920]   and the virgin birth, that when the fullness of the times had come, God sent forth his Son,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.800]   made of a woman, made under the law. If only we were thinking about this this morning and at all
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.520]   other times, as we look at our present problems and troubles and the whole course of history,
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.840]   and everything in this world, I say, if we could only look at this and concentrate on this,
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.160]   that God has done this thing. And we are Christians because we say, this has happened,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:29:00.160]   the incarnation, the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, but not only that, he is the Christ,
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:08.320]   his Son Jesus Christ. And the Christ is the Messiah, he is the Savior. He is one who has
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.160]   come to deliver. He has not merely come as a kind of spectacle. He has not merely come to appear,
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:20.000]   he has come for a given work. He is the Christ. Oh, here's the thing that the Old Testament was
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.960]   looking forward to. The people were waiting for the coming of this mighty Deliverer. They didn't
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.920]   understand it, but they believed he was coming, the Messiah, the long-expected, the prophet like
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:39.040]   unto Moses. When will he come? The answer is, he's come, the Christ, the Savior, the one who has come
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:46.640]   to do that which alone can redeem us and rescue us and set us free from the bondage of sin and
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:54.480]   Satan and really bring us into the kingdom of God. The Savior, Christ, his Son Jesus Christ.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.400]   Our Lord, the one who owns us, the one who has purchased us, whose possession we are. Oh,
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.080]   look how the apostle works out all these great themes in this epistle when he's dealing with
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:21.280]   the particular fleshly, carnal sin. He says, "Know ye not that your bodies are the temples
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.720]   of the Holy Ghost?" And then he says, "You are not your own, you've been bought with a price.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.400]   You don't belong to yourselves. You have no right to do what you think with yourselves,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.280]   nor what you like with yourselves. You are Christ's. He's bought you, he's ransomed you,
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.080]   he's rescued you, he's redeemed you. You belong to him, he's your Lord."
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:50.480]   No man can say that Jesus is Lord, he says in the twelfth chapter in the third verse, but
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:31:03.920]   by the Holy Ghost, his Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. What's it mean? What is the testimony?
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:14.640]   The testimony is this, that God's way of salvation is in his Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:26.160]   and in him alone. There is no other way. There is none other name under him given amongst men
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:34.800]   whereby we must be saved save this name. None other. There is no second, there is no addition.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:43.520]   He is alone. You notice how it was put there in that chapter which I read to you at the beginning,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:49.440]   John at the end of his life and old men, wants these people to be absolutely certain about it.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:55.840]   He is writing to a church, let me remind you, and he says that this is the record,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:05.680]   that God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:14.960]   "He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:21.600]   That's the apostolic preaching. This isn't my narrow theory.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.240]   This isn't my own little personal theology. This is the testimony, the witness of all these apostles.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.120]   And they are but repeating the testimony of their blessed Lord and Master who said,
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:44.480]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh, can come unto the Father but by me."
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:52.160]   My friend, your soul's eternal salvation depends upon this. Don't talk to me about knowing God
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.560]   if Christ isn't at the center of it. Don't talk to me of communion with God,
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:03.120]   of being blessed by God, unless you believe that Christ is his Son and that he and he alone is your
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   Savior who has died for your sins and shed his blood that you might be reconciled unto God.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:25.040]   God, he is the author, but God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:35.520]   not imputing unto us our trespasses. For God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:42.080]   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. We cannot be made righteous except in him.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:49.600]   Oh, the tragedy that it's necessary to go on repeating and emphasizing these things.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.560]   But it is necessary. Look at it again. Justification, if you like, is by faith only.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:07.920]   In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, being justified freely
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   by his grace, God's grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:20.320]   Of course, God is love and God is full of grace. Yes, and it's because of that that he saves us.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.800]   But, my dear friend, if you want the salvation, you must accept God's way. This is the means that
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   God himself has employed. It is God who so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.000]   that whosoever believeth in him, the Son, should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.720]   Oh, we must be clear about this, that a Christian is one who has believed and received and accepted
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.960]   the testimony of Christ. He said it. He said it in life. He said it dying.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:01.440]   And he sent out these men filled with the spirit to preach it and to proclaim it.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:11.120]   So that I say that a Christian is a man who has not only believed these things but who is certain
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:21.920]   of them, even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you. A Christian is a man who says,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:30.640]   "Now none but Christ can satisfy, none other name for me. There is life and love and lasting joy,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:40.400]   Lord Jesus, found in thee." He is a man who says, "I tried the broken systems, Lord,
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:49.280]   but all their waters failed." A Christian is a man who says, "I see it all. I see it all in him.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.000]   He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. He is the lily of the valley,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.880]   the bright and morning star. He is the fairest of ten thousand to my soul." He is a man whose
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.440]   Christ intoxicated, whose life centers on Christ, whose whole being is there, who delights to
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.400]   repeat the name as the apostle Paul did and can't write a letter without bringing him in,
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:18.560]   in every sentence as it were. Christ is all and in all.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:30.800]   Is the testimony of Christ confirmed in you, my dear friend? That's what makes us Christians.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.600]   I leave it at this this morning. I've stayed with it. I'm emphasizing it because if you're not right
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.840]   at this point, there's no purpose in proceeding. How can you tackle the problems in the church at
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.480]   Corinth if this isn't right? The only way, I say, to deal with schism is to ask, "Was Christ
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:54.560]   divided? Was Paul crucified for you? In whose name were you baptized?" If we're not right
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:59.840]   about this first thing, we cannot be right about anything else. So you see, it comes back to this,
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   after all. There is no use talking to people about the Christian view of war, or the Christian view
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:13.360]   of peace, or the Christian view of solving the problems of industry, or solving any problem in
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.000]   this country at the present time. It's a waste of breath to talk to people about things like that
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.840]   if they haven't already believed the testimony of Christ.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:27.200]   Ah, they're very interested in Christian teaching, and they say, "What has Christ got to say about
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.400]   this?" My dear friend, what you and I must start with is this, "What does Christ say about God,
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.280]   and about you, and about the only way of being right with God?" That's the testimony of Christ.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.360]   You cannot apply Christianity to anybody except Christians.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:51.520]   The ethic of the New Testament is an intensely personal ethic. All the epistles which deal
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:58.080]   with the practical problems are all written to church members, to Christians, to believers.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.200]   And obviously, so as I say, you can't develop your argument if the axioms are not accepted.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.320]   You can't draw out deductions and conclusions if people are uncertain about that.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:17.280]   So, we must ever start with the testimony of Christ.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:33.600]   His Son, God, sent for His Son. Yes, made of a woman, made under the law. Why? That he might
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   redeem them that are under the law. His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord, the One who, because He so
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:56.000]   humbled Himself, hath been highly exalted, and has been given a name that is above every other name,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:06.320]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow. Of things in heaven, and things on earth,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.080]   and things under the earth. Oh, I want to test you as I leave you.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:20.880]   Can you say honestly, from the depth of the heart, "Jesus, the very thought of thee,
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:31.280]   with sweetness, fills my breast." Is He all to you? Is He everything to you?
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:43.920]   That's the Christian. He has accepted and has confirmed within him the testimony of Christ.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.940]   Amen.
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:52.320]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
