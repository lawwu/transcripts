[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.460]   Is your California dream feeling more and more distant?
[00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.260]   You've got countless apps and influencers
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.380]   telling you how to do it their way.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.640]   And your expert aunt who might be giving
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.560]   a bit too much advice.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.580]   Tips, hacks, and experts are everywhere these days.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380]   But when it comes to real estate,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.180]   the question to ask is, who's your realtor?
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.200]   Because a California realtor is the only person
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.580]   who can bring your dream home.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.540]   Someone who gets that buying a home
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.300]   is one of the most complicated and stressful things
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.780]   you can do, but can still make it possible on your budget.
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.820]   A California realtor can read the constantly shifting market
[00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.460]   and they're out in front for all of the tough stuff.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.140]   So you can get to the good stuff.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.780]   So who's your realtor?
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.300]   Because no one cares more about helping Californians
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.160]   live the California dream than California realtors.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.280]   - Today on Radical Personal Finance is live Q&A.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:20.500]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.180]   a show dedicated to providing you with knowledge,
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.860]   skills, insights, and encouragement
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.540]   that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.900]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.260]   in 10 years or less.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.100]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.920]   I'm your host.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.060]   Today is Friday, May 24, 2024.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.620]   Always fun when we get those dates.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.740]   And on this Friday, as we do on every Friday,
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.020]   in which I can arrange a microphone and a camera
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.920]   and all that good stuff, we do live Q&A.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.980]   Live Q&A works just like call and talk radio used to,
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.060]   or at least probably still does.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.460]   You call in talking about anything that you want.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.700]   You can gain access to one of these Friday Q&A shows
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.380]   by going to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance.

[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.840]   This is probably your cheapest way to talk directly with me,
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.220]   as long as you don't mind my using your questions,
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.860]   your comments, your feedback, your controversies,
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.460]   whatever you have to talk about as content for the show,
[00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.420]   then that's fine.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.620]   You can do that, again, by becoming a patron.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.060]   Remember right now, as I record this on May 24,
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.380]   the consulting calendar is open,
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.380]   and I'm running a sale on it.

[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.220]   Sign up now, as it'll be this next two weeks
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.740]   where those calls are available
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.700]   before I have some summertime travel.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.940]   So I hope that you will sign up.
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.780]   We begin today with John in Florida.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.020]   John, welcome to the show.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.580]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.020]   - Hey, Joshua, and happy Memorial Day weekend to you.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.860]   - And to you.
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.060]   - Thank you.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.900]   So I have a good question here.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.820]   I recently retired from the military,
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.160]   and now with my military pension
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.940]   and the new career that I have,
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.700]   my wife and I have found ourselves in a situation
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.740]   that we're unfamiliar with.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.740]   We have a lot of extra margin in our budget,
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.700]   and I'm just trying to be smart with it.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.220]   We've been enjoying it for the last couple of months,
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.140]   catching up on spending that we'd held off.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.860]   But now that we've done that and everything,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.700]   how can I be smarter with this surplus
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.420]   versus just finding ways to spend it every month?
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.260]   - Sure.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.420]   How old are you currently?
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.460]   - I am 40.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.300]   - 40 years old.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.100]   And you said you started a new career
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.940]   in addition to your pension payment, is that right?
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.820]   - Correct, yes.
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.020]   - And how much are you earning at the new career?
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.420]   - The salary is just under 100K, like 97,000.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.220]   - And then how much is your pension?
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.700]   - 84,000, with the vast majority of it being tax-free.
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.380]   - Great.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.040]   Does your wife also generate income?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.100]   - She does.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.460]   She's a real estate agent,
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.140]   so it's hit or miss,
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.900]   but we probably can plan on her bringing in
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.180]   an extra 20 to 40 a year, I would think.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.500]   - And about how much do you guys usually spend
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.860]   prior to this time of recent increases
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.980]   to kind of make up for lost time?
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.820]   About normally, what do you think your budget normally is?
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:42.620]   - We normally were spending between 7,000 and 8,000 a month.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.620]   We now have like 15,000 a month available.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.220]   - Do you have children?
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.020]   - Two young children, yes.
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.580]   - Okay.
[00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.340]   And about how much is your current net worth
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.140]   in terms of savings and investments?
[00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.780]   - We're just under 600,000, like 570.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.620]   - Okay.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.660]   What are the options that you're considering choosing among
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.660]   in terms of what do you think you wanna spend the money on?
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.660]   - Well, I mean, we would like to purchase a new house
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.300]   and retain our current one as adding,
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.220]   we currently have a rental property.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.180]   We would like to make our current house a rental
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.100]   and get a new one.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.780]   But with interest rates right now,
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.260]   that's becoming quite a challenge.
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.060]   So our short-term goal is pocketing some savings
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.660]   to add our down payment.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.580]   - Okay.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.980]   Do you think you ever wanna retire fully?
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.180]   - Fully, yeah.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.780]   I think that's probably a ways off, but yeah.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.620]   - Why would you want to retire fully?
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.820]   - Well, I think with my pension,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.340]   I would have the ability to,
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.980]   it at least would provide the flexibility
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.620]   and cover the life necessities.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.980]   Anything above and beyond that would,
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.180]   I would need to earn something
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.220]   to cover non-necessity fund money.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.140]   But I don't think I wanna work behind a computer
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.980]   for the rest of my life.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.820]   - Why not?
[00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.860]   - There's gotta be more to life than just in an office,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.060]   but I don't know.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.820]   I had a six month period between leaving the military
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.820]   and starting this career
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.540]   where I spent most of my time at home.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.380]   And I do think I maybe squandered it a little bit
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.300]   and didn't fully take advantage of it.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.780]   But I did enjoy being home
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.220]   and having the extra time with my young children.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.620]   - How old are your children currently?
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.140]   - Three and seven.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.980]   - Okay.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.540]   Do you tell me about your vision
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.180]   for the kind of father you'd like to be,
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.860]   the kind of family you'd like to raise your children in?
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.020]   - I wanna be able to continue
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.620]   being a positive influence and role in their lives,
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.700]   showing up in their lives,
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.100]   influence and role in their lives,
[00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.060]   showing up to their major milestones,
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.060]   setting some core values.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.580]   The values have been instilled in me to be successful.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.260]   I feel like I'm successful.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.020]   And then my youngest is special needs.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.660]   So her needs are still a little,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.340]   we're gonna figure out as she gets older
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.620]   what her limitations will be.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.620]   But just, I need to think about that some more,
[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.940]   I think, being put on the spot a little bit.
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:39.780]   - Sure, sure.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.300]   Well, I won't keep probing, although ordinarily I would.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.540]   I want you to think about some of these questions,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.260]   and I'm gonna give you some more as we talk.
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.740]   But let me give you a few different layers to think about
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.580]   in terms of the money.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.740]   First, in terms of your financial situation,
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.340]   you have a great net worth.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.780]   You have more money coming in right now
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.140]   than you're spending.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.960]   And thankfully, a significant amount of your income
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.660]   is guaranteed for life.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.900]   This is a wonderful combination
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.540]   because it gives you a strong stability
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.580]   underneath your financial situation.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.100]   Having a military pension is fantastic.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.580]   To be 40 years old, have a military pension
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.180]   of $84,000 a year is amazing
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.660]   because now if you got sick, if you got hurt,
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.060]   if you didn't wanna work,
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.660]   you could just retire on that for the rest of your life.
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:33.780]   It would be less of a lifestyle
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.540]   than you're currently accustomed to,
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.300]   but you could do it, and that's an option for you.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.740]   So it's a wonderful job that you've done
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.820]   to put yourself in this situation.
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.540]   Because of the military pension,
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.220]   there's a lot less pressure
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.780]   on other aspects of your finances.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.460]   It doesn't mean you won't still want to save money,
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.700]   but there's less pressure
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.920]   on other aspects of your finances.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.860]   So you have a lot of choices.
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.860]   And so let's talk through some of those choices
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.060]   and think of some ways to consider
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.860]   what might work out for you.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.740]   First, you can simply consume the money.
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.440]   There is no one that I have ever met
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.660]   who in the fullness of time
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.620]   can't figure out ways to spend excess money
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.820]   just because it's there.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.180]   Going from seven or $8,000 a month
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.980]   to $15,000 a month of expenses
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.360]   might seem like a lot today,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.920]   but if you get used to it for the next three or four years
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.740]   instead of just three or four months,
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.220]   then pretty quickly that'll be your standard,
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.780]   and it'll be very easy to suck it up.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.660]   Some of these expenses will be related to your children.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.780]   At three and at seven,
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.780]   there haven't been that many things
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.700]   that you really could or want to spend money on
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.740]   with regard to your children
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.860]   that would suck up all this extra money.
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.060]   But in the coming years,
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.440]   there'll be many, many things
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.020]   that you could spend the money on.
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.980]   Children can be a bottomless pit for money.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.080]   Everything from private school tuition
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.980]   that can easily suck up 20 or $30,000 per year
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.100]   for each of them,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.020]   all kinds of extracurricular things,
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.300]   life enrichment things, personalized coaching,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.120]   classes, all kinds of consumption.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.540]   I mean, I could blow your entire budget
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.460]   just in consumption for your children.
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.780]   And it'll all feel great
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.860]   because it's all investing in your kids.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.740]   It'll make you feel good 'cause it's not just about us.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.460]   Then you get to the whole layer of family experiences.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.420]   And so there's a whole long list of things
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.520]   that you could buy, a new house, and a new truck,
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.340]   and a new ski boat, and a new RV.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.220]   And you can spend all this money
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.900]   just in terms of facilitating family experiences.
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.180]   And again, this is great stuff.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.060]   This is all really useful things
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.740]   that would genuinely enhance your family experiences.
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.360]   Those are options.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.180]   So there's plenty of ways to consume it
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.500]   even without seeming frivolous.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.620]   It doesn't seem frivolous
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.660]   to enroll your child into an expensive school.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   It seems like a good thing to do,
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.460]   and yet it will quickly suck up your money.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.380]   And I would encourage you
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.460]   that those are all options for you.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.060]   In addition, then of course,
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.020]   remember that you really should be spending money
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.200]   on any therapy or additional support
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.100]   that would help your younger child to flourish.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.380]   One of the things that often happens
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.860]   is people who have some form of handicap
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.220]   or a special need, however we label it,
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.300]   in many cases with a determined father
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.900]   who is going to war for that child
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.360]   and who has the money to spend on treatments,
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.060]   a lot of conditions can be fully changed
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.180]   just based upon the determination of a parent.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.300]   Not all, I'm not being foolish with what I say,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.540]   and I don't know anything about
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.460]   the particular features of your child.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.660]   Just simply saying that a lot of times
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.980]   things can be changed with determination and with money.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.620]   And you probably have both of those things.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.600]   So there are lots of things there.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.740]   What I would say is there are a few areas though
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.420]   that will probably feel better in the fullness of time
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.580]   than just purely wandering into it and consuming it,
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.860]   even if you can justify the consumption.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.700]   Number one, you should consider having more children
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.580]   if you're able to or if you want to.
[00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.900]   Having more children is something
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.820]   that frequently people don't do
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.300]   because they don't feel like they can afford it.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.880]   Well, if you feel like you can afford it
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.420]   and you have a little extra money,
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.380]   I've never yet met, they're probably out there,
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.740]   but I haven't yet met anybody
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.060]   who has regretted having more children.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.980]   I have met many people who have regretted
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.460]   not having more children.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.940]   And so since you have a little bit of financial wiggle room,
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.900]   it should be a relatively straightforward thing
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.660]   if you and your wife don't want to have more children
[00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.940]   to have more children.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.380]   And then of course that comes with
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.660]   an associated increase in costs.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.520]   But having more children and trading some of the finances
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.620]   for more love in your life over the long term
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.660]   and a bigger opportunity to impact the world
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.260]   through the work with your children
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.460]   is probably going to pay off big time.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.280]   Number two, you should consider very, very carefully
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.000]   and very deeply the kind of lifestyle
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.020]   that you want your children to have,
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.860]   the kinds of things that you want them to actually do.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.360]   If you have a vision that is different
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.140]   than the normal mainstream
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.100]   of what you're trying to accomplish
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.160]   in raising your children,
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.980]   you might find that really being focused on that,
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.460]   either with the extra money or with the flip side
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.660]   of earning just a little bit less money
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.700]   so that you earn what covers your income needs
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.820]   so that you can be free to invest into your children
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.900]   in whatever ways are appropriate,
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.820]   I doubt that's a decision that you'll regret.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.060]   That's one of the things that I have purpose to do
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.000]   is that I have purpose to say that I like to make money,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.080]   making money is great, I want to make a lot of money.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.200]   But I can make a lot of money at any point in my life.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.760]   I'm firmly persuaded that high levels
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.800]   of involvement with my children
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.280]   and high levels of investment of time
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.120]   and also money in my children at a young age
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.320]   is probably when the money pays off the most.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.200]   And so you can invest into them
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.120]   with time and dedication and focus
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.840]   and it'll pay off enormously in the long run.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.240]   As an example of this,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.180]   and I see this a lot of times with military guys,
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.000]   there's this ex-military guy that I like.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.320]   I don't think he publishes anymore,
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.680]   but he has this YouTube channel called Analytical Survival,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.500]   something like that.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.200]   I found him years and years ago.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   And he has this super interesting
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.720]   survivalist prepping YouTube channel
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   where he's super hardcore about all these
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.260]   hyper great organization with all of his projects.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.400]   But then he started to turn his prepping channel
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.000]   into a homeschooling channel.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.920]   And he has a son, as best I could figure out
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.160]   from years ago when I used to watch him.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.000]   He has a son and he brought the same intensity
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.160]   that he brought to all of his prepping endeavors
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.360]   and to his military organization into homeschooling his son.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.440]   And he's clearly an amazingly dedicated homeschool dad.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.940]   And his son is light years ahead.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.480]   And if to the academics and experiences
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.360]   that you want your children to have,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.360]   they don't usually require much money,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.080]   but they require some time.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.720]   And it's not that difficult for you
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.800]   if you take an interest in it as a father
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.120]   to make certain that your children
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.520]   are two or three or four grade levels ahead of their peers,
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.040]   purely based upon the interest,
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.920]   purely based upon your being there.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.780]   And the best time to do that stuff
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.080]   is when they're young in the elementary years.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.760]   I think there are very good reasons,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   very compelling reasons to have children enrolled
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.540]   in traditional mainstream structures of school
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.360]   as they reach their middle school years
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.120]   and their high school years.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.320]   But there are very few reasons that I can find
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   why that's a good decision in the elementary school years
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.480]   for those who have an alternative choice.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.760]   And if you do have time flexibility
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.340]   and you have financial flexibility,
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.180]   you can bring in all kinds of fascinating lifestyle choices.
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.640]   I'm not saying what's appropriate for you.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.080]   I'm trying to lay out a menu of things
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.580]   that I find interesting and motivating.
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.800]   And so if you've got, let's say, three years from now,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.200]   you've got a 10-year-old and a four-year-old
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.240]   or 11-year-old and a five-year-old, whatever winds up.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.800]   I get the split, 11 and six is perfect.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   And you load up in a pickup truck and a pickup truck camper
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.120]   and you spend a year or two wandering
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.720]   from Canada to Mexico with your children,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.080]   you're going to have a closeness of relationship
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.600]   that is basically impossible to have
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.200]   in the modern mainstream American lifestyle.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.840]   And it can be facilitated based upon your work flexibility,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.320]   the fact that you can, over the next four years,
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.900]   you can buy one or two more houses
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.120]   that are going to be rental houses.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.680]   And then you plan and you work at your job right now
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.180]   over the next three or four years.
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.840]   But then you plan a three or four year sabbatical
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.280]   and time off and really build that relationship
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   with your children when they're at a wonderful age
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.840]   to benefit from travel, benefit from world schooling.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.140]   And you've got the financial structure in place
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.800]   to facilitate your doing that.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.040]   And you come back richer than when you left,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.920]   but it's all built upon the vision of what you want to do
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.880]   mixed with the base that's provided by your pension
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.320]   and then being smart with the extra money.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.940]   If you have a short or medium term goal like that,
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.680]   then it will bring into focus what you should do
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.280]   with this extra money.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.800]   So as I used in that example,
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.560]   if you know that I'm going to take three years off
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.120]   when my eldest is 10 years old or 11 years old,
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.440]   four years from now,
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.600]   then my plan is I'm going to take four years off
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   and we may not use all of it world schooling,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.920]   but we'll spend a year or two in the United States
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.200]   and North America.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.080]   Then we'll go to Europe for a year.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.340]   Then we'll go to Asia for a year.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.440]   Then we'll come back and we'll enroll the children
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.040]   in high school in the United States.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.040]   That's a perfectly reasonable plan.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.360]   But it would give you a focus then
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.920]   as to what you should invest in.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.440]   And so now you're going to get more serious and say,
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.420]   all right, I'm not going to buy the forever house
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.920]   because the children are still young
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.640]   and I'm going to set up and I'm going to buy the big house
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.760]   when we get back and enroll them in high school,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   but I'm going to go ahead
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.600]   and pick up a couple of more rental properties.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.200]   And that's going to be my focus.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.400]   So over the next four years,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.200]   my goal is to buy two more cash flowing rental properties.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.520]   And what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy them
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.260]   as quickly as possible now that I have the excess money
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.160]   that can be spent on these mortgage payments
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.180]   so that I have this set aside.
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.700]   So the goal brings into focus what I should do to achieve it.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.640]   Now, the other pathway that we can go down,
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.180]   let's assume that nothing of what I've said so far
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.420]   is relevant.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.860]   So then we just flip to long-term impact
[00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.480]   and long-term investing.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.080]   There is absolutely nothing wrong
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.000]   with just taking this money and tossing it aside,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.080]   all the extra money, tossing it aside every month
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.920]   in an index fund.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.740]   - We're Raiders.
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.680]   - We're neighbors.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.000]   - We're trailblazers.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.600]   - We're at the top of our game.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.160]   - And we're more than the strip.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.280]   - We're beyond your wildest expectations.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.400]   - We're headfirst into the currents of change.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.760]   - We love a good challenge.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.040]   - A better cost of living
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.640]   and an incredible retirement plan
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.120]   as a teacher in Las Vegas
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.880]   by the Clark County School District.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.360]   We are Vegas.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.040]   We are CCSD.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.440]   Start your adventure at teach.ccsd.net.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.120]   We are CCSD.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.280]   Start your adventure at teach.ccsd.net.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.320]   - And your net worth will grow so fast if you do that.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   And if you do that systematically,
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.960]   you'll have millions of extra dollars a few years from now,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.200]   more than a few, I'm being a little bit excessive there.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.560]   In a decade from now, you'll have so much extra money
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.360]   that you're not currently planning on,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.720]   and it'll move you to a totally different state.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.960]   And again, your children are likely to form
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.760]   a significant part of your vision.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.280]   So now you can be thinking about,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   I wanna get a couple of houses, one house for each child.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.840]   I'm gonna make sure that the children are really set aside
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.680]   so that they're financially taken care of
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.880]   so they can have freedom, they won't go into debt,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.240]   I'll pay for their college, all those kinds of things.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.460]   Or just general wealth building.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.240]   And so there's nothing wrong with just saving the money,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.000]   and your future self will be much more glad that you did it
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.520]   and that you eased into consumption more slowly
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.560]   and more strategically
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.680]   instead of just sucking up all the money.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.320]   Finally, what I would say is,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.120]   you should be really focused on making certain
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.840]   that your career is optimized
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.000]   not only for financial production,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.240]   but also for meaning and long-term impact in the world.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.760]   One of the traps that people fall into mentally
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.880]   when they need money is they always chase the thing
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.760]   that provides them with the most short-term financial gain.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.840]   And that's a reasonable thing.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.640]   If you've got bills, you've got children,
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.080]   you need the money, you want the money,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.160]   and so you choose the job or the career
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.920]   that gives you the most direct path to money.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.480]   When you get a little margin in your life
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.000]   and you don't need money quite so urgently,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.080]   which is the situation that you're in,
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.520]   then you can think about it on multiple levels of analysis.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.200]   And you can look at your job and your career
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.480]   from the perspective of long-term impact
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.080]   or meaning in some personal way that's appropriate for you.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   This can be done in a financial perspective.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.120]   So very frequently, I'll work with somebody
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.800]   who once you've gotten the wolf away from the door
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.120]   a little bit financially,
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.680]   you know, guy's piled up two or $3 million,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.440]   and he's on track, everything is good,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.440]   then he can pull back and he can say,
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.440]   "All right, I'm not chasing now any additive projects.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.560]   "I'm not gonna chase a project
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.200]   "to add another million or $2 million.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.640]   "I'm gonna chase a genuine multiplier project.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.320]   "So I'm gonna go for an opportunity,
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.840]   "build a business that's a longer shot,
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.680]   "but has a bigger long-term outcome.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.800]   "I'm gonna try to go from $2 million of net worth
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   "to $20 million of net worth for the next five or six years,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.600]   "knowing that it might not work.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.000]   "I might still be stuck six years from now
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.760]   "with a $2 million net worth,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.000]   "but that's more motivating than the idea
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.520]   "of just staying in the normal course
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.920]   "and just focusing on going from $2 to $3.5 million."
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.880]   And then the flip side is,
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.280]   it's not always measured in money,
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.400]   but sometimes it's measured in impact.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.600]   You analyze your life and you analyze the things
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.160]   that you're engaged in, that you care about,
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.640]   and you say, "If I could really make an impact,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.160]   "imagine myself 10 years from now,
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.320]   "20 years from now, 30 years from now.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.040]   "If I could really move the needle
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.240]   "for this cause that I care about,
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.600]   "this position that's really important to me,
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.480]   "this need in society that I really wanna change,
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.880]   "this problem that's staring us in the face,
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.800]   "if I could really move the needle in that direction
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.160]   "and I could invest the next 20 years of my life
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.760]   "into changing that,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.440]   "even if I didn't make a lot of money at it,
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.480]   "it would really be satisfying to me
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.720]   "to know the difference that I made in the world
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   "because of that."
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.880]   And so you pursue something that has
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.840]   an extraordinarily high potential return of impact
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.240]   or change in the world,
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.880]   even if it returns a little bit less money.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.360]   So there are, of course, many other pathways
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.560]   that we could go down,
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.920]   but that's kind of just a menu of ideas.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.160]   And if you think about that menu of ideas
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.640]   and something resonates with you,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.320]   or over the coming months you find a goal
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.760]   that resonates with you,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.200]   then having a clear goal will bring into clarity
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.120]   what you should do with your money.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.040]   There aren't really any wrong things
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.720]   that you could choose to do with the money.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.640]   You could consume it, you could invest it,
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.440]   you could do any number of things,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.280]   and they're all fine based upon your goals.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.160]   And so if you don't yet know what to do
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.560]   with the extra money, which is the question you called,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.840]   what I would encourage you
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.320]   is just set the money aside for now.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.840]   Set a specific budget for your family
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.760]   that's something like what your current expenses are.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.880]   You don't need to tighten the screws, do everything,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.680]   but don't also allow in a bunch of inflationary spending.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.920]   Just set the budget at a reasonable number
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.040]   for where it is right now,
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.680]   and set aside all the excess money
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.880]   into a savings account for now.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.520]   And then spend a lot of time getting as clear as possible
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.280]   on what your goals are.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.640]   Spend time with your wife.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.480]   What are her goals?
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.120]   You may be able to fund something
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.360]   that she's always dreamed of.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.720]   She may not have always dreamed of being a real estate agent,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.760]   but she may have always dreamed
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.160]   of impacting the world in some other way.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.720]   And so when your goals are clear,
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.440]   then the specific financial plan
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.320]   of what you should invest in will also be clear.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:09.920]   - Wow.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.880]   I like a little bit of all three scenarios you discussed there.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:21.280]   I need to re-listen to this and sit down with my wife
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.800]   and go over some of it,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.800]   because I definitely think that doing something
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.040]   that might not make a lot of money
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.840]   definitely falls in line to getting involved
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.240]   in doing something with my daughter.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.480]   And then I like the idea of taking a sabbatical.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.240]   And you brought up some really good points, Joshua.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.080]   Thank you.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.920]   - Good, my pleasure.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.000]   Yeah, spend time talking with her, spend time dreaming.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.720]   And by the way, you can do all of these.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.960]   Recognize, and this is probably difficult
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.680]   if you just got out of the military.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.640]   My experience working with guys in the military is,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.040]   it's very difficult to know what you want to do,
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.240]   because you made a decision 20 years ago
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.360]   that you weren't gonna think about what you wanted to do,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.880]   because you were gonna live your life under orders.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.280]   And in a way, what you're experiencing,
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:15.040]   having retired recently from the service,
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.960]   what you're experiencing is kind of what a lot of
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.360]   high school and college students experience.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   And I'm touching on this because I want people to hear it
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.240]   both from a high school and college perspective,
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.120]   as well as from your specific perspective.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.600]   One of the things I think is a real harm
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.280]   in the way that we teach children
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.560]   is we prescribe their high school career to them,
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.600]   and in some cases, their college career.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.160]   But we prescribe their high school career so tightly
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.920]   that it's unusual for a high school student
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.600]   to have any time or bandwidth to explore
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.800]   what he himself is actually interested in.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.640]   So then he gets to age 18,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.720]   and people say, "What are you gonna do?"
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.920]   And he's at a loss because he's not accustomed
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.360]   to looking into the future.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   He's not accustomed to looking into himself
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.320]   and looking at the world.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.680]   He's not even aware, really,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   of the options that are out there.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.840]   He's not thinking about what he could do,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.800]   and it takes a long time for him to figure that out.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.520]   And a lot of times, this explains some of the challenges
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.160]   that people go through of going to college and flunking out
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.560]   and then going back and changing majors five times.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.520]   If a high school student has not had any experience,
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.400]   and he hasn't had years of people asking him
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.640]   what he wants to do, and he hasn't exercised agency
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.280]   in actually pursuing the things that he wants to do,
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.720]   how is he supposed to have the skills
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.760]   to be able to say, "This is what I wanna do,"
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.080]   and go after it?
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.360]   So I think we need to take this into account
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.480]   in how we train teenagers
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.320]   so that teenagers have much more agency and autonomy
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.040]   from an early age so they build the skill,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.080]   the muscle, the ability to actually know what they want
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.960]   and then have experience of going after it.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.920]   Now, if you joined the military
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.600]   when you were a very young man,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.400]   you haven't asked,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.200]   other than, "Do I wanna stay in or get out?"
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.680]   You haven't been asked,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.280]   "What do you want to do for 40 years now?"
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.000]   And so your what-do-I-wanna-do skills
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.200]   and your muscles in that department
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.000]   are much weaker than someone else
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.800]   who was unschooled as a child
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.560]   and has decades of experience
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.540]   of just doing the things that he wants to do.
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.880]   So part of the process of getting out of the military
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.400]   involves you spending time strengthening those muscles.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.800]   That cannot be done in a week or a month or even a year.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.200]   It's gonna be a multi-year process.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   But you can do all of those things.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.520]   You could, and I would suggest to you
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.760]   that from knowing what I know about people
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.600]   and goal planning and the kinds of things
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.200]   that resonate with people,
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   I would encourage you to take something
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.640]   like a three-year time horizon on your current job
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.740]   and not go beyond three years.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.880]   Because if you, for the next three years,
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.720]   work at this job, have all this extra money,
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.160]   you focus on using it to really enhance
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.000]   your financial situation.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.300]   Maybe we'll have a real estate crash.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.140]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.080]   In the next year or two.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.800]   And you could buy a couple of more rentals
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   or whatever works out.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.640]   And then at that point in time, your eldest would be 10.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.540]   10 is an amazing age to go traveling.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.520]   If you go traveling now at seven and four,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.920]   or seven and three, your children will not,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.160]   your youngest will not remember any of it.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.080]   But if you go traveling in a few years
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.460]   and you've got a 10-year-old,
[00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.600]   he or she will really engage with that.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.200]   And then as your children start to grow,
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.180]   you've got plenty of time.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.000]   You know, imagine yourself with teens
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.720]   and your teens are in school every day
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.140]   and you've got money, you've got time.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.980]   Well, you can go ahead and put in 20, 30, 40 years
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.100]   at a career that you're really engaged with, with outcomes.
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.060]   You and your wife may build a business together.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.040]   You may have a dream project of some kind.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.600]   The world's totally available to you
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.000]   and you have built the good foundation
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.440]   to make this kind of planning easier
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.680]   than for most other people.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.100]   So congratulations.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.880]   Just recognize that there's a good chance
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.680]   that your here's what I want muscles
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.720]   are probably a lot more atrophied
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.040]   because of the career choice that you previously made.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.500]   And it's gonna take you a few years
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.160]   to whip those muscles into shape.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.360]   - That was spot on, you know, everyone was asking
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   when I was leaving the military, what I wanted to do.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.280]   And, you know, my answer was when I was 18 year old,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   John wanted to join the Navy.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.680]   He never gave any thought at all
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.060]   to what 40 year old John would do after the Navy.
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.900]   - Exactly.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.840]   - That was spot on and that's great advice
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.920]   to pass on to, you know, high schoolers
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.000]   that are considering the military as an option.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:40.960]   - Yeah, great.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.840]   I think it works well.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.520]   I think it's a good option.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.900]   Meaning that it can pay off as it's paying off for you.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.380]   It's just a different choice.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.100]   So the financial rules for you to follow is number one,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.320]   don't go into debt.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.800]   So do not go into debt for anything.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   If you, and let me just describe.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.840]   You could buy a house.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.320]   If you buy a house, make certain that the mortgage on it
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.920]   is a low enough amount that you could fire sale the house
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.720]   in a few weeks, pay off the mortgage and be free of it.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.400]   Beyond that, don't pile up payments of any kind.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.280]   So do not go into debt.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.480]   As long as you don't go into debt,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.500]   then financially you can't really screw this up.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.520]   So you just need to live on what you're making.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.960]   And if you're making the higher amount with the job
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.440]   and your wife's income and the pension and all that,
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.560]   then awesome, you'll live on the higher amount.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.420]   If you can't, if you're gonna get rid of the higher amount
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.800]   by doing something different,
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   arrange a lifestyle that exclusively lives on your pension.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.580]   And if you do that, you won't have any financial regrets.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.240]   You'll be fine financially.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.420]   All of the options are available to you.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.880]   Kyle in Washington, welcome to the show.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.160]   - Hi, Joshua.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.940]   I am kind of nervous today
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.780]   'cause I'm gonna challenge you
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.060]   on something that you've stated.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.160]   - Well, I'm the nervous one, come on.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.920]   (laughing)
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.000]   - It's odd for me to try building frameworks
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.840]   for you to look at.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.000]   So I show
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   1016.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.480]   You talked about
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.560]   the trades being boring to you.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.140]   And you've talked about this a couple different times.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.860]   And I would like to call in,
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.800]   I'm calling to challenge that viewpoint a little bit
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.960]   because I think that,
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.040]   not to demean the amount of time
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.280]   that you've spent in the trades,
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.000]   but I don't know if you have personally enough time.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.880]   I'm sure you've met plenty of people that have
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.400]   and have given you good advice about like,
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   don't be a car mechanic.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.840]   You're gonna hate being a car mechanic.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.520]   But if I may, I'd like to just address that a little bit.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.760]   - Please do, absolutely.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.720]   The floor is yours. - Okay.
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.560]   Thank you.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.440]   So you said I've done some carpentry.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.880]   I've done, I've worked for a tile setter.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.160]   You don't wanna be,
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.640]   I think the Twitter poster said,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.760]   you don't wanna be hanging sheet rock for 30 years.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.800]   And that's all entirely true.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.480]   Like if you're gonna be on a framing crew,
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.180]   you're probably gonna get bored in a few years.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.040]   If you're gonna be hanging sheet rock,
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.360]   you're gonna get bored in a few years.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.320]   But I think that people don't see those trades.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.000]   There are a lot of other trades out there
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.300]   besides these horrific, beat your body up.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.520]   I'm a scaffolder and I'm only gonna do scaffolding
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.060]   until my body's used up.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:19.260]   And so I think, if you're gonna take
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.740]   and coach a young man down the road of the trades,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.600]   you really need to look and see that it's really a much more,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.240]   you can take a much more overarching approach.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.280]   Yeah, you're gonna hang sheet rock for a few years
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.060]   until you graduate to being a finisher.
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.300]   And then you're gonna finish for a few years in track homes
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:41.340]   until you get really good.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.240]   And then you're gonna go finishing in hospitals.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.320]   And then you're gonna go finishing in high-end homes.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.760]   And then you're gonna be running a finishing crew.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.120]   The same thing for the tile setter.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.140]   You're not doing any interesting problem solving
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.440]   until you start laying out crooked rooms
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.360]   or laying out interesting tile designs
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.520]   or going into the stonemasons union
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.960]   and learning how to do structural stone work
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.040]   and brick work and things like that.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.260]   You're not gonna be doing interesting problem solving
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:11.960]   if you're framing the same house 10 times.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.240]   But if you're building custom homes,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.960]   maybe that is a lot more interesting problem solving.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.720]   And so, yeah, certain trades can get boring.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.800]   If you work at Grease Monkey, you're gonna get bored.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.960]   But if you're taking apart an electric car
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.120]   that we're not allowed to fix on our own
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.760]   and learning how it works, you're a lab coat diagnostician.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.820]   You're not some tradey,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.240]   you might have grease under your fingernails,
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   but dude, you're learning all manner of different systems
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   and computerization
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.640]   and taking apart other people's engineering.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.860]   And yeah, you're not degreed
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.640]   and you're not working as a knowledge worker
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.400]   in the strictest sense of the word.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:55.960]   But building that type of knowledge base,
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.640]   I think is really important
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.360]   before you can move on to the next step.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.280]   And not every trades person
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.840]   is gonna start a sheetrock company
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.360]   or start a framing company or a scaffold company
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.240]   or anything like that.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.280]   But I think that it's something that really gets overlooked.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.800]   And I did the same thing.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.960]   I don't wanna be a car mechanic,
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.540]   so I'm just gonna quit being a car mechanic.
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.360]   But there are ways that you can,
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.920]   if you wanna be a car mechanic, you can.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.680]   And then you can start an automotive repair shop
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:23.040]   and all of a sudden you're a business owner
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.320]   and you're not just a trades person,
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.240]   you're learning business
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.440]   and you're learning community outreach
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.640]   and all these different things.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.980]   And I think it gets, I know that was a short show,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.480]   but I think that the trades get minimized in that way.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   Like it's boring and it becomes uninteresting
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.560]   and it beats your body up.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.160]   And certainly there are trades like that,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.200]   but there are also trades that aren't.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.880]   And that's why I'm calling.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.940]   - I think it's a fair apology for the trades.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.040]   And what I probably should do is I should go ahead,
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.460]   I have intended to, it's one of the many things on my list,
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.560]   but I should go ahead and create a standalone podcast
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.880]   that is a standalone apology for the trades.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.440]   I used to, I've lost the spreadsheets,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.600]   but years ago I created a bunch of spreadsheets
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.480]   and I was trying to figure out the payoff
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   of a college degree that had a certain cost
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.200]   and yet that made a certain higher income
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.920]   as compared to somebody who went directly to work.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.280]   The basic idea that let's say that somebody starts
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:33.120]   at 18 years old and gets a job making $45,000 a year
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:38.040]   and earns 45,000 at 18 and 45,000 at 19, 45,000 at 20
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.320]   and increasing with inflation of course,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.240]   as compared to somebody who goes to college for four years
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.280]   and gets out and maybe starts at $55,000,
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   which of course is not guaranteed in any way,
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.180]   but it starts at $55,000, but yet had to pay it back
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.560]   and the lost value of money.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.360]   And anyway, I used to have spreadsheets,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.280]   but I lost them all.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.200]   And so there is a good argument that you could be made
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.080]   from a financial perspective.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.720]   In addition, I've known a lot of people
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.040]   who've built a lot of wealth in the trades
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.200]   and it's especially just with things like side work.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.000]   I was amazed when I watched how many electricians I knew
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.560]   who as very young guys,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.400]   yeah, very young guys are making six figures
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.680]   because they had a day job working for an electrical company
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:27.280]   and all their side work was just never ending.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.320]   And so I totally see what you have said.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.280]   I would add another argument,
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.040]   which also aligns with the line of thinking
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.600]   that you're going down.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.840]   I've for years observed that many people
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.560]   who are very intelligent get funneled
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:46.320]   into a few automatic jobs.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.200]   You often get funneled into medicine
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.520]   or they get funneled into law
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.160]   or they get funneled into banking or investing,
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.160]   Wall Street, something like that.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.080]   And for years, I have said, usually flippantly and offhand,
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   that if you're the kind of guy who has the mental ability
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.040]   and the motivation and the grit and the determination
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.800]   to go and be a lawyer,
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   you're probably better off to go and start a daycare company
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.440]   or a trades business or something, open a junkyard,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.000]   some kind of scrap metal place,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.280]   doing something where there are fewer wickedly smart people
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.600]   competing with you.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.240]   It's kind of like the classic thing about college selection.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.900]   I heard a talk a number of years ago by a psychologist.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.960]   I forget the name, so I can't cite him,
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.060]   but he was giving a talk at Google
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.480]   and he gave the presentation and his point, he said,
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.320]   if you have the ability to get into Harvard,
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.720]   you should certainly not go.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.840]   And his point was that if you are one of the smartest people
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.360]   and you've worked hard for years
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.800]   to build this amazing resume and you stand out
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.180]   and you have the ability to go to Harvard,
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.640]   the day you get to Harvard,
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.640]   you're gonna be, instead of being filled with confidence,
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.360]   you're gonna be beating yourself up as the dumbest,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:12.120]   most dim-witted, underachiever in the entire school
[00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:15.080]   because you're surrounded by the cream of the crop
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.120]   that's all smarter and better than you.
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.560]   And that is what's going to affect your self-image.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.400]   He said.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.240]   - We're raiders.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.120]   - We're neighbors.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.480]   - We're trailblazers.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.020]   - We're at the top of our game.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.600]   - And we're more than the strip.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.680]   - We're beyond your wildest expectations.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.840]   - We're head first into the currents of change.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.200]   - We love a good challenge.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.080]   - A better cost of living and an incredible retirement plan
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.560]   as a teacher in Las Vegas
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.360]   for the Clark County School District.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.840]   We are Vegas.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.520]   We are CCSD.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.900]   Start your adventure at teach.ccsd.net.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.600]   We are CCSD.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.400]   Start your adventure at teach.ccsd.net.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.600]   - On the contrary, if you are good enough
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.960]   to get into Harvard and instead you go
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.680]   to the local state university,
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.440]   you're gonna be the big man on campus.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   You're gonna be the top of your class
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.300]   and your self-image is gonna be amazing
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.760]   because you recognize I'm smart, I'm sophisticated.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.960]   I have all these things going for me.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.080]   And that psychological confidence is gonna flow with you
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.520]   for the rest of your life.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.420]   And so what I'm saying as far as if someone is smart enough
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.000]   to be a doctor, then if that person who's really smart
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.580]   instead goes and opens an auto mechanic shop,
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:25.440]   then he's probably going up against people
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.080]   who are not so academically intelligent
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.040]   and yet they are, and so he'll be able to do better
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.120]   because the competition is less fierce
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.000]   than all of the physicians that he's surrounded with
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.080]   at medical school.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.320]   So I would add that as another argument
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.140]   in favor of choosing something like the trades.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.100]   The problem that I tried to describe for me,
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.560]   and I wonder if there are different kinds of intelligence.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.820]   So I'll describe just briefly
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.460]   why I am not attracted to the trades.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.260]   And this is different from why someone else
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.380]   may or may not be attracted.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:05.120]   I think I myself have enough experience
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.860]   and enough components of the trades to know that for me,
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.480]   it's not a good fit.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.540]   The reason it's not, I've got years
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.580]   of doing it in different things.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.500]   I worked in a different trade all through high school,
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.580]   through college in variety.
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.800]   There are, I haven't done plumbing.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.760]   That's about the only thing I haven't done.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.360]   I've done roofing, I've done carpentry,
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.640]   I've done electrical work, I've done tile,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.680]   I've done cabinet, no, I've not done cabinets.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.920]   So I mean, the point is that I've been around a lot of it,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.760]   been around a lot of job sites.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.400]   And what I always just discovered
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.640]   is that I feel incompetent with my hands.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.440]   And I have a good friend of mine that I grew up with,
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.720]   and it seemed to, always seemed to me
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.280]   like he had this magic skill
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.300]   that he could touch something
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.340]   and he could instantly understand how it works.
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.780]   Like the way that stuff fits together.
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.740]   He's an electrician today,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.220]   he works at a nuclear power plant, makes great money,
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.140]   never went to college, made great money all the way through.
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.860]   But he and I are night and day different.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.020]   He's got this ability that I just,
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.180]   anytime I'm with him, I see,
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.340]   he's got this physical spatial awareness
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.340]   of how things work and how they go together.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.100]   And he'll sit there and he'll build something
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.020]   and he'll work and he'll get it just right.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.700]   Me on the other hand, if it doesn't work
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.260]   and the angles don't fit, I'm just annoyed as anything.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.400]   And if the bolt breaks off,
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.160]   then I got to deal with this other thing.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.340]   Whereas for me, ideas just flip together like that.
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.600]   And so I can listen to a snippet of a conversation.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.520]   And in my mind, it's just like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.760]   I understand, here's the argument,
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.400]   here's where it's coming from, here's how it fits,
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.320]   here's where it flows in, here's what the person thinks,
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.240]   here's what's likely to happen
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.920]   because the person believes this way.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.120]   It just, it's very obvious to me
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.080]   that my brain works differently in that capacity.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.440]   What I don't know is if that's trainable
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.600]   or learnable, was it something that I grabbed
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.280]   that is just a natural reflection of my core genius
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.000]   or is it a natural reflection
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.200]   of just what I pursued over the years
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.240]   and I put the time in, I have no idea.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.560]   But that's for me why I would choose something different
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.540]   because a lot of the day that I would spend in the trades,
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.000]   I would spend it frustrated by things not working
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.620]   the way that they're supposed to be.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:15.600]   And that I haven't built the skills to deal with it.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.680]   Maybe it's just an undone skillset.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.160]   So I think there are differences of people
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.040]   and my point in that Twitter thread,
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.040]   I don't know if I would have written it the same way,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.440]   it was just someone else did.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.040]   But my point is that there is rightly a pushback
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.680]   against the pathway of going to college
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.040]   because college has been so oversold for so long
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.160]   that a lot of people are very frustrated and hurt
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.000]   because of their decision to go to college
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.560]   instead of to go to be involved in the trades,
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.640]   something like that.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.100]   But the flip side of that is that in the coming years,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.120]   I now hear constantly,
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.580]   when I first did shows against college years ago,
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.440]   I felt like I was one of the leaders.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.880]   Today, I hear constantly everyone saying,
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   don't go to college, don't go to college, go to the trades.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.800]   And so I fear that we're gonna make the opposite switch
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:06.200]   and we're gonna funnel people wrongly into the trades
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.380]   who shouldn't be in the trades.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.200]   They should be in some kind of mental work
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.360]   that is work with your mind
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.400]   and creating things with your mind
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.400]   rather than creating things with your hand.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   And so what I think, if I'm elected emperor of the world,
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.040]   what I'm going to do is I'm going to say,
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   people should have experience in both things fully.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.480]   So if I were elected emperor of the school system,
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.920]   I would immediately bring back shop class.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.400]   I would immediately bring back home economics.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.320]   I would immediately bring back those things
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.620]   because one of the most valuable aspects
[00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.560]   of those types of classes are to expose people
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.240]   to things they otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.120]   And so I want to have the son of two lawyers,
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:54.960]   mom and dad are hotshot lawyers.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.560]   I want him to be in shop class building a table
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.400]   and discover that he loves building a table.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.840]   And then simultaneously, I want to make certain
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.880]   that there's coding classes
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:08.180]   and that people are also exposed to knowledge work.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.920]   I want the humanities, I want mathematics,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   I want science, I want the coding classes.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   I want the son of the carpenter to be taking coding classes
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.480]   and building something as a high school project
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.840]   because he may discover
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.000]   that this is really an engagement with him.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   And then I want those things to be done
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.360]   over enough time, enough years,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.000]   so that the young person gets a really good sense of,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.040]   is this something that feels good to me
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.960]   or is this something that doesn't?
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.160]   And that by that exposure,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.380]   people will properly self-select into the trades
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.320]   who should be in the trades
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.640]   and people who shouldn't be in something else.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.500]   That would be my vision.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.440]   I think your points are totally valid.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.740]   And it would be my vision
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.380]   that there should be enough experience
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.280]   that each person has in order to select properly.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.220]   - Yeah, agreed.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.280]   And that's another thing people forget
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:04.420]   is a lot of journeymen have four years of apprenticeship
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.760]   before they're journeymen.
[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.740]   I mean, you get a degree of sorts.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:10.660]   A lot of times they'll give you an AA
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.400]   along with your journeyman card.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:18.180]   And so, yeah, I don't disagree with you.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.520]   And I think another point you made was,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.260]   you run into a lot more intelligent people
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.860]   and you can get a lot more camaraderie
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:25.860]   and stuff like that in knowledge work.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:28.040]   And I don't disagree with that.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.540]   I'm still having a tough time figuring out
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.860]   which one I like more, knowledge work or physical labor.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.220]   And so I bounce back and forth between those two things.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.420]   And not to say anything about those people in the trades,
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.260]   but they are fewer and farther between
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.700]   if you wanna be challenged on an intellectual level
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.540]   very often.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:48.540]   And so, yeah, I didn't think that you were speaking against
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.060]   for any specific reason.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   And I think that you can know yourself well enough to say,
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.380]   I just get too frustrated when I'm working on cars.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.220]   It makes me angry.
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.620]   Even if I have all the right tools,
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.080]   I'm not gonna be a mechanic.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.920]   - Right.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.940]   - Yeah, incredibly valid.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.420]   I would also say that probably,
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.700]   we've kind of lost this in our current day,
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   but our culture was built by farmer philosophers,
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.440]   by warrior poets, by philosophical craftsmen.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.940]   It shouldn't be the case that it's either you do one thing
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.180]   or another thing.
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.060]   And in fact, many people over the years
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:35.140]   have drawn great solace from their physical work.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.660]   One of the things that I think is very satisfying
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.460]   about physical work is you can go and you can do the work.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.180]   You can see the outcome, what you've created quickly.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.340]   And when you're done with the work,
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.080]   you can leave the work there.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.540]   It's taken me years to just grow comfortable
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:53.180]   with the constant low-level anxiety that comes from business
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.700]   that the work never finishes and it always is with you.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.340]   It always stays with you.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.220]   And I often have thought how wonderful it would be
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.380]   to have a job where I went to work,
[00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.640]   I did the job, and then I went home.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.660]   And how satisfying that would be to know that I'm done.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.400]   I don't have to think about it anymore.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.120]   I'm genuinely free of this job because I went to work,
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.140]   I did the job, and now I've left.
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.100]   And that's something that a mechanic
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.860]   or any kind of tradesman gets the satisfaction of knowing
[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.460]   that I never get that satisfaction because I've never done.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.300]   It's never enough.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.860]   There's always more that I could do and I just quit.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.700]   So there are many benefits.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.700]   And also intellectual rumination frequently happens
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.400]   in concert with working with your hands.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.900]   And so you'll find many great people throughout history
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.160]   who were great thinkers or great statesmen
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   or great inventors that they didn't eschew physical work.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.180]   They rather found that it was an important component
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.740]   of their life balance.
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.760]   And I would say that there's probably people
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.660]   who've been funneled into college
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:04.020]   who would give that intellectual engagement
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.220]   if they were still in trades.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.940]   One of the things that I made in a separate show recently,
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.420]   I made the point, is that the sorting mechanism
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:16.220]   of the United States college system over the last 100 years
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:21.220]   has basically enormously succeeded at grabbing anybody
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.520]   who's good at academic level work
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   and shunting them into the college path.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.720]   Prior to standardized testing,
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.840]   there were lots of people
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.520]   who were academic intellectual geniuses
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.520]   who would go and work a job with their hands
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.060]   or run a factory or do some kind of job
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.960]   that didn't include college.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.480]   And they would indulge their evening hobby
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.320]   of studying ancient philosophy
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.600]   or translating the Hebrew scriptures.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.040]   That was a very normal thing in the past.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.840]   But now the mass testing system has succeeded
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.200]   at finding all those people
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.960]   and kind of automatically shunting them
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.680]   into the college space because, hey, listen,
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.240]   you've got a high IQ that is demonstrated
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.120]   by your success on these tests
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.880]   for mathematical and verbal reasoning.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.280]   So we've got to get you into college.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   And so they're just not in the trades like they once were
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.120]   because of that.
[00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:15.320]   And the trades suffer for that
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.440]   and the people suffer for that
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.800]   because sometimes genius is lost
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.080]   because somebody is working
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.680]   an unfulfilling middle-manager white-collar job
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.840]   when he'd be a lot better off
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.120]   swinging a hammer in the daytime
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.960]   and reading Greek philosophy at night.
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.120]   Yeah, you're speaking about a good family friend of mine.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.040]   The guy I knew dabbled in languages.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.200]   He knew seven languages
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.720]   and he worked in a drop forage plant
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.280]   and got sick of it and moved on to be a machinist
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.040]   'cause you're working with an eighth of an inch
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.800]   instead of a thousandth of an inch.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.520]   We were at a garage sale one time, my family,
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.800]   and we bought this guy an unabridged dictionary.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.120]   Best present I ever got.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.480]   But you don't expect that guy
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.760]   at the drop forage plants to know seven languages.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.480]   - No, no, no.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.920]   - Yeah, you never do.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.600]   Not anymore, like you say, yeah.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.080]   - Well, I appreciate the pushback.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.680]   I think it's important points that you're making
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.200]   and I've gotten several bits of feedback
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.600]   on that podcast episode.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.880]   I have a clarifying show that I've recorded
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.520]   'cause I had a lady that asked me a bunch of questions
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.400]   based on what I said about men and women
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.480]   and I guess I'll go ahead and release it.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.960]   But it's interesting how that struck a chord
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.800]   with several listeners.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.320]   I'm really glad that you called in and made your comments.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.960]   Thank you very much, Kyle.
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.080]   - Thank you.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.960]   - And with that, we move on to Ben in Florida.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.800]   Ben, welcome to the show.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.040]   How can I serve you today?
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:41.920]   - Hi, Joshua, I have a tax planning question.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.960]   Never too early in the year to start thinking about that.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.920]   - That's the best time to be thinking about it
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.840]   'cause you get to April 14th and you're done.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.360]   There's nothing left anymore.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.400]   - That's right.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.920]   I need to realize about $100,000 worth of gain
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.400]   of appreciated stock this year
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   and in the spirit of being a radical personal finance
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.440]   listener and listening to your show,
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   I would like to start planning now to pay what I owe
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:15.600]   but also as little as I should.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.200]   I'm a W-2 employee.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.520]   I maxed out my 401(k).
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:24.520]   I do not own any real estate or any side business.
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.520]   So I'm maxing out 401(k), maxing out HSA.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.320]   What are my other options?
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.080]   I'm open to buying real estate if there is depreciation
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.520]   I could take this year.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.840]   If I can buy some sort of business
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.640]   and then depreciate those assets this year,
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.360]   that would be a little harder to do to find a business
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.840]   and buy it and depreciate before the end of the year.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.200]   I'm trying to think of ideas
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.120]   so I can start researching further
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   and maybe find a separate tax professional
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.760]   to help me execute strategies.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:03.960]   - This stock that you have, how long have you owned it?
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:09.120]   - Long enough that it's long-term capital gains.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:09.960]   - Okay.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.720]   So just privately owned stock, a single stock?
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:14.560]   - Yes.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.400]   - Okay.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.160]   - And I have done some charitable contributions.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.600]   That's what I've done.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.120]   On some of it, I have done the charitable contributions
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.000]   so I can not pay capital gains on those shares
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.560]   and also deduct that
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.480]   because it will be above the standard deduction.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.320]   - Okay.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.640]   - But there's more that I will need to pay
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.000]   that I want to, if this can get me into real estate
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.680]   or something else, some other strategies
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.000]   that I can think about.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.280]   - Do you have any losses, any long-term capital losses
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.240]   from another portion of your portfolio?
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:58.560]   - Not as much as I would need to offset the gains.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.400]   - Okay.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.600]   - I have some.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.960]   - Well, that's, so that's your,
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.720]   so when you're dealing with capital assets
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.160]   that are not business assets, just purely capital assets,
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.600]   then what happens is you take all
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.720]   of your long-term capital gains
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.240]   and you net those against all
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.360]   of your long-term capital losses.
[00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.880]   And that results in your figure.
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.280]   You take all your short-term capital gains,
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.680]   you net those against short-term capital losses as well.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.640]   And that creates your figure.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:29.080]   So if you have $100,000 of long-term capital gains,
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.880]   the first thing you should look for is,
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   do I own other assets that are long-term capital assets
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.040]   that I don't want to hold anymore?
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.560]   So I'm selling Coca-Cola stock and I don't wanna,
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.720]   I'm not gonna, I'm selling company A stock
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.640]   where I have $100,000 of gain,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.240]   but years ago I bought company B stock
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.160]   and I've got $30,000 of losses of that stock.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.080]   And I don't wanna own it anymore.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.440]   So I'll go ahead and sell that.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.360]   And you wanna realize those capital losses
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.720]   and net them together.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.400]   That's your first reliable strategy.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.640]   'Cause there's not, the short answer is
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.080]   there's not much you could do in what you're describing.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.720]   So the first thing is look around in your portfolio
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.360]   for other long-term capital losses
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.840]   that have assets that you don't wanna hold anymore
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   and sell those assets and net the assets against your gains.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.200]   Now you have the ability then,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   if you wanna have those assets,
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.800]   you have the ability to,
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.560]   let me think just for a moment, my brain is going fuzzy.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:35.080]   Doing this live, I always get this fuzzy.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:39.920]   So basically what we wanna avoid is the wash sale rule,
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.160]   but we can sell assets that are at a loss
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.640]   and we take the losses and then you can buy them back
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.080]   if you want to have them.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.880]   So that's what you're looking for.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.400]   And so there shouldn't be any reason,
[00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.600]   there shouldn't be any reason
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.800]   you can't sell the other assets.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.880]   And then if you want to own them,
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.400]   buy them back in the fullness of time.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.120]   I need to go back and pull up,
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.000]   and I don't have it live on air,
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.400]   I need to go back and pull the wash sale rules up.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.880]   So that's what you wanna look at
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.800]   and make certain that you don't violate something there.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.920]   And my brain just went fuzzy on this for a moment.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.520]   So--
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.240]   - The 30 days you can't purchase the same stock
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.520]   or significantly similar 30 days before or after
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.480]   to not violate the wash sale rule,
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.720]   is from what I understand.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.960]   - Right, so the point is that you have the ability
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.860]   to sell assets at a loss and net them against your gains.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:43.760]   Beyond that, basically you're stuck with charitable donations
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.680]   or paying the tax.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.520]   You can't depreciate real estate assets
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.500]   against stock sales.
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.600]   So beyond what I've just described,
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:57.280]   I'm not aware of any useful planning technique
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:02.280]   that is applicable here that you can do.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.700]   Let me just think for a moment as we're talking,
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.200]   but that's it.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:07.940]   So you're gonna just sell the stock and pay the tax.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.200]   Beyond that.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.960]   - Okay, and while you talk,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:12.880]   there was a couple of years ago
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.020]   where I did do the foreign earned income exclusion.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:16.860]   That was great.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.000]   I'm not gonna qualify for that this year, and that's fine.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:20.840]   - It won't make a difference.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.240]   It's only on earned income.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.840]   - Okay, okay.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.200]   - Yep, foreign earned income exclusion is pointless
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.920]   because it only applies to earned income.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:29.840]   This is not earned income.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.280]   This is capital gains income.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.020]   - Okay, great.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.480]   And then, so I can't depreciate real estate losses
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.800]   against stock capital gains.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   I was trying to think of a way this could get me into,
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.080]   instead of owning paper assets or stock,
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.520]   I could start getting real estate
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.520]   and also lower my taxes owed.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.080]   But it sounds like there's not much else I can do
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.840]   to offset that large amount of capital gains in stocks.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.680]   - No, there's not.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:04.800]   You can do like-kind exchanges on all kinds of property,
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:09.080]   but you can't like-kind exchange a stock into real estate
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.120]   'cause they're not like-kind,
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   and so you're not exchanging them.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.720]   Like-kind exchanges are not just limited to real estate.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.840]   They're not just 1031 exchanges,
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.520]   but they're not applicable to stock here.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.400]   So what I would say is,
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.920]   have you thought about borrowing against the stock
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.480]   instead of selling it?
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.120]   Could that be a solution for you?
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.980]   - No, the stock is getting acquired,
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.600]   so it's gonna be a for sale.
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:35.920]   So I cannot do anything.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.080]   - No, there's nothing you can do.
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.620]   I mean, that's it.
[00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:40.840]   So, and especially since you have earned income,
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.360]   you're not gonna have a loss on income.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.000]   So basically, look around your portfolio,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.120]   look to see any other capital, long-term capital losses,
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.440]   sell those assets, take the loss,
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:53.580]   recognize the loss on those other assets
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.200]   that you don't wanna own anymore.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.480]   You'll net those other long-term capital losses
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.760]   against these long-term capital gains
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.620]   that will reduce the total amount of capital gains reported,
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.800]   pay the tax, and move on.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.520]   Be grateful that currently,
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:07.160]   capital gains taxes are still low.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.440]   There's always these ridiculous tax proposals
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.120]   to tax capital gains, like ordinary income,
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.040]   and just be grateful that you're in that situation
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.540]   that, or it's not there, or we're not there today.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.920]   - Yeah, we're not there today, hopefully.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   Hopefully it stays that way, but time will tell.
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:22.760]   - Yeah.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.540]   On the whole, long-term capital gains taxes
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.640]   are very reasonable.
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.700]   There is, I mean, I'm just going through
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.080]   my inventory of ideas.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.480]   None of them are gonna apply to you.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.520]   There are other ideas that can be used.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:37.720]   There are things when you have zero income,
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.720]   you may be in the zero long-term capital gains bracket.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.820]   There's all kinds of other things,
[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:44.240]   but if you're earning income, as you described,
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:46.640]   it's a forced sale, as you described,
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.820]   then I'm not aware of any other idea
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:52.400]   that could be used to offset the gains.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.480]   So just be grateful the capital gains tax rates
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.760]   are reasonable compared to how they are
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.240]   in many other places in the world.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.600]   If you don't find them reasonable,
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.680]   then take steps to extricate yourself entirely
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.580]   from the U.S. tax system.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.000]   Puerto Rico is a great option for long-term traders.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   You're not gonna move there, though.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.680]   That's not applicable, and it's just the price
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.880]   of being a U.S. citizen.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.280]   - Okay, well, thank you.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.740]   - My pleasure, anything else?
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:19.520]   - Nothing else.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   I asked about, I'm the one that asked
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.880]   about those info a couple weeks ago,
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.320]   so I'm glad to get a finance question in
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:29.440]   instead of that, so thanks for your broad knowledge
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.840]   across many topics.
[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.400]   - The problem with broad knowledge, it can be useful,
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:34.760]   but the problem with broad knowledge
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.120]   is just like my brain froze up
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.600]   in thinking about wash sale rules.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:38.720]   This is the kind of thing that,
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.240]   when you talk about so many things all the time,
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.040]   all of a sudden you get into the nitty gritty,
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.720]   and I should have all those things
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.800]   able to summon instantly,
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.780]   but unfortunately sometimes I don't, so.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:51.700]   Thank you so much for calling.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.400]   If you would like to join AXS, anyone else,
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.540]   if you'd like to join me on next week's Friday Q&A call,
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.380]   remember you can do that by becoming a patron of the show.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.620]   Go to patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.340]   patreon.com/radicalpersonalfinance,
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.380]   sign up to support the show on Patreon,

[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.140]   to one of these Friday Q&A shows.
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.660]   In addition to that, remember that consulting calls
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.660]   are open right now, and what I do is,
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.740]   when people do consultations with me,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.020]   I always read the notes in advance,
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.060]   and if I know I've got something,
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.340]   I've got watch sale rules pulled up on my screen
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.160]   right there, ready to go so I'm not caught flat-footed.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.060]   So thank you for that.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.680]   If you'd like to book a consulting call with me,
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.320]   go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.660]   radicalpersonalfinance.com/consult,
[01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.460]   and I'll be back with you very soon.
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.040]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:44.260]   - Wear good, what does that even mean?
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:47.380]   At Tom's, wear good is a deep-rooted philosophy.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:50.020]   It's timeless style and cloud-like comfort.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.540]   But most of all, wear good is a commitment
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:54.420]   to improving the lives of others.
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.140]   When you purchase a pair of Tom's,
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.060]   you're helping to fund access to mental health resources
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.460]   for those who need them,
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.620]   and you're fostering positive change for the world at large.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.020]   Plus, you look good, and when you look good, you feel good,
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.780]   and when you feel good, you're ready to do good.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.660]   Take part in the human purpose of helping others.

[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.300]   around mental health, because by working together,
