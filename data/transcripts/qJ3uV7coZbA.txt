[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.340]   and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   Today is an Ask Me Anything episode or AMA.
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is part of our premium subscriber channel.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340]   Our premium subscriber channel was started
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.780]   in order to provide support
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.800]   for the standard Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]   which comes out every Monday
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.720]   and is available at zero cost to everybody
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.240]   on all standard feeds, YouTube, Apple, Spotify,
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.080]   and elsewhere.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   We also started the premium channel
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.860]   as a way to generate support for exciting research
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.900]   being done at Stanford and elsewhere,
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420]   research on human beings that leads to important discoveries
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.180]   that assist mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.360]   I'm also pleased to inform you that for every dollar
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.580]   the Huberman Lab premium channel generates
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.900]   for research studies,
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.700]   the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount.
[00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.620]   So now we are able to double the total amount of funding
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020]   given to studies of mental health,
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.940]   physical health, and human performance.
[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.900]   If you'd like to subscribe

[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.500]   is for you.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.900]   So without further ado,
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.420]   let's get to answering your questions.
[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.100]   The first question is about resveratrol.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.900]   The question specifically is, and I quote,
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.020]   "There seems to be a lot of conjecture about resveratrol
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.740]   and whether or not it can extend lifespan.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.860]   Could you please tell us your thoughts on this subject?"
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.740]   Okay, well, I will indeed tell you my thoughts
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.320]   on this subject and I'll use it as an opportunity
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.920]   to also give you my thoughts about supplementation
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.100]   for sake of longevity,
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.640]   that is for extending lifespan more generally.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.360]   So resveratrol got a lot of attention some years back
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.300]   because of, at the time,
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.760]   it was believed that supplementing with resveratrol
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.300]   could impact certain cellular pathways
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.140]   that would extend not just the lifespan
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.420]   of those individual cells,
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.640]   but perhaps the lifespan of the entire organism,
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.180]   meaning us, humans.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.220]   And as a consequence,
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.660]   supplements such as resveratrol supplements,
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.980]   but also grape seed extracts,
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.140]   which we know contain a fair amount of resveratrol
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.300]   or can be converted into resveratrol,
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.280]   also received a lot of attention
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.220]   for the potential to increase lifespan.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.900]   Now, I think by now, 2023,
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.340]   it's fair to say that most of that thinking has been,
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.080]   let's just say, debunked.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.420]   I think that most people understand
[00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.700]   that while indeed resveratrol
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.420]   might have some positive effects
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.020]   on the functioning of our cells,
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.820]   that there is very little, if any, direct evidence
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.700]   that resveratrol can increase lifespan.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.180]   If you are aware of any data to the contrary
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.620]   that is modern, is highly controlled,
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.420]   and even better was carried out in human studies
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.240]   or non-human primate studies, or even mouse studies,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.380]   please put links to those in the comments on YouTube,
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.860]   because I'd love to see those studies,
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.080]   especially recent studies.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   But my current line of thinking is that resveratrol,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   while it may have certain health benefits,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.480]   does not seem to increase lifespan.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.840]   Now, with that said,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.120]   that doesn't mean that things like resveratrol
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.980]   or grape seed extract are of zero utility.
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.320]   In fact, I take 400 to 800 milligrams of grape seed extract,
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.540]   usually with a meal,
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.160]   it's just part of my standard supplementation stack,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.660]   every single day.
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.460]   But I do that mainly for its effects
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.380]   on vascular function and blood flow,
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.840]   and a few other effects that grape seed extract
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.180]   has been related to.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.820]   The data there, I would say, are reasonably strong,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.260]   strong enough, certainly,
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260]   that when weighed against the potential downsides
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.060]   of taking grape seed extract,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.740]   including the cost of grape seed extract,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.520]   lead me to take 400 to 800 milligrams
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.220]   of grape seed extract per day.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.240]   I just do that as a kind of general insurance policy
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.620]   against a number of things.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.040]   And it's part of a small kit of supplements that I take
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.700]   that fall into that category,
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.460]   meaning supplements that appear to be very safe,
[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.840]   certainly at the dosages that I just referred to,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.260]   supplements that potentially are having positive effects
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.420]   on our cells,
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.380]   and that are fairly, if not very low cost, okay?
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.220]   So that's why I take grape seed extract.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.820]   I do not take it for its potential impact on resveratrol
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.100]   and resveratrol-related pathways per se,
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.440]   and certainly not to extend my lifespan.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.420]   So that basically answers the question that I was asked,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.820]   which is, what are your thoughts on resveratrol
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.060]   for extending lifespan?
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.140]   My answer was, I don't think it extends lifespan,
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.540]   but I take something related to resveratrol
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.580]   for other health purposes.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.540]   And by the way, I certainly wouldn't place grape seed extract
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.780]   in my list of top five or even top 10 supplements
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.820]   if somebody, for instance, said,
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.420]   I want to take anywhere from one to 10 supplements,
[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.020]   and I have X amount of budget to devote to supplementation,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.060]   and I'm thinking about taking grape seed extract,
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.840]   would that be one of the top 10 supplements
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.680]   you would recommend?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.800]   I certainly wouldn't put it in the top 10.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.740]   And by the way, at some point in the not too distant future,
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.300]   I will put online, so I'll probably do a podcast episode
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.140]   listing out all the supplements that I take
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.480]   and the rationale behind those,
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   and how long I've taken them,
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.160]   and the effects that I've observed,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.140]   both subjectively and in my blood work,
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.880]   and what I recommend to other people,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.160]   what I don't recommend to other people,
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   what's specific to me, and so on and so forth.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.040]   But meanwhile, that's my answer to the question.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.420]   I don't think resveratrol increases longevity,
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.620]   at least I'm not aware of any direct evidence
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.560]   for that in humans.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.740]   Now, with that said, let's use this as an opportunity
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.900]   to talk about some of the other so-called
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.340]   longevity supplements and drugs
[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.020]   that are often discussed online and elsewhere
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.280]   in terms of their efficacy to increase lifespan.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.420]   About four or five years ago,
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.940]   there was a sudden and increased attention
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.820]   on NAD-related pathways for increasing longevity.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.180]   So the NAD pathway, as some of you may already know,
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.600]   is a pathway within all of our cells.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.300]   This is a pathway that is highly active
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.060]   in young animals and humans,
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.660]   but all animals and humans across the entire lifespan
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.580]   make NAD in their cells.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.980]   It's related to cellular energetics,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.680]   that is the production of energy in cells.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.300]   It has direct relevance to mitochondrial function
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.140]   and mitochondrial function to it.
[00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.300]   And that's a discussion into itself,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.840]   but suffice to say that the pathway leading to NAD
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.060]   includes things such as NR and NMN.
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.780]   NR and NMN are considered by many to be precursors to NAD.
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.340]   Okay, so why am I telling you all these acronyms?
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.720]   Here's the deal.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.920]   The argument was made, in fact, by some prior guests
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast and elsewhere,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.540]   that by increasing NAD levels in our cells,
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.860]   that one could potentially extend lifespan.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.920]   And there are generally three ways
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.300]   in which people have attempted to do that.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.400]   Okay, we'll talk about whether or not
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.040]   increasing NAD in our cells
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.780]   actually increases lifespan in a moment.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.720]   But for the time being, let's just talk about
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.580]   some of the ways that people have tried to increase NAD
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.480]   within their brain and body.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.200]   The most typical ways that people have done that
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.960]   is through, until very recently, supplementation.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.260]   And so there are supplements out there such as NR,
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260]   which we know can increase NAD levels.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.840]   So this is taken as a pill or a powder,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.780]   sort of typically as a capsule or a powder.
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.780]   Or by taking NMN, which, and here there's been some,
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.820]   let's just say debate as to whether or not taking NMN
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.920]   actually leads to increases in NAD within our cells,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.260]   whether or not it can get into our cells,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.980]   whether or not it's converted into NAD,
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.960]   and so on and so on.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.880]   But there again, the idea was by taking NAD
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.440]   either in capsule form,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.900]   or it's sometimes taken as a sublingual powder,
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.780]   that one could increase NAD levels
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.420]   and thereby potentially increase lifespan.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.220]   And then there's a third way that's commonly used
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.020]   to try and increase NAD levels.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.340]   And that's by infusing, by intravenous infusion,
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.020]   or in some cases by oral administration,
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.780]   either liquid or pill form NAD itself.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.260]   Now, I confess that I have tried
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260]   all three of these approaches, okay?
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.340]   So I do indeed take an NR supplement every day.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.020]   I take 500 milligrams of NR.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.900]   I also, and have separately taken an NMN supplement.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.040]   I take sublingual NMN.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.020]   So I'll take anywhere from one to two grams of NMN
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.100]   as a sublingual powder, which as the name suggests,
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.700]   you put it under your tongue and it dissolves there.
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.880]   It's got this kind of tangy flavor.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.880]   And the goal for me in taking NR and NMN each day,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.460]   and I should mention that sometimes I have just taken NMN
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.220]   or just NR to do the comparison between NR and NMN
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.980]   for me in a subjective way,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.740]   just comparing what are my energy levels, how do I feel,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.960]   whether or not there are any side effects.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.300]   And then I've also taken them together
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.580]   and I've arrived at a protocol
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.500]   where I take NR and NMN every single day.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.220]   And the goal of that is indeed
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.900]   to increase NAD levels within my system.
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.940]   However, and I really want to emphasize this,
[00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.900]   I do not take NR and NMN in order to increase my lifespan.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.020]   In fact, at this point in history,
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.260]   it's unclear and seems somewhat unlikely
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.840]   that increasing NAD is going to increase lifespan,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.900]   but I think we should always keep our minds open.
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.020]   There may be data to arrive in the future
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.220]   that shows that that actually does happen in humans.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.740]   Now, there are some animal data suggesting
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.500]   that increasing NAD either by taking NR and or NMN
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.820]   can increase lifespan,
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.900]   but frankly, that is not why I take NR and NMN.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.340]   I take NR and NMN in an effort to increase NAD,
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.860]   and now I realize what I'm about to say
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.220]   is entirely subjective and I really want to highlight that.
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.420]   What I'm about to describe is my experience.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.700]   It is not based on any peer-reviewed studies.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.300]   When I take NR and NMN at the dosages
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.900]   I talked about a little bit earlier,
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.200]   it gives me a lot of sustained mental
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.780]   and physical energy throughout the day.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.020]   Now, I've always had a lot of mental and physical energy,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.660]   but I'm 48 years old now,
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.700]   and I'm interested in doing anything that I safely can
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.580]   to keep those levels of energy as high as is reasonable.
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.620]   I don't want to have so much energy that I can't sit still
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.640]   or so much energy that I can't sleep at night,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.700]   but I find that when I take NR and NMN in the morning,
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.900]   so typically I'll do this before my first meal,
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.140]   I don't really regulate how close it is to that first meal,
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.980]   so I'll wake up, use the bathroom, hydrate,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.600]   get my sunlight,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.280]   do all the things I've talked about on other podcasts,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.500]   but I'll take my NR and NMN
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.140]   sometime usually within about an hour or two of waking up
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.420]   and typically at least 30 minutes to two hours
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.460]   before my first meal,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.340]   which for me usually arrives around 11 a.m.,
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.340]   so sometimes I'll take it long before my first meal.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.220]   In any event, it gives me a lot of energy
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.900]   and I seem to have that energy throughout the day.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.220]   I have gone periods of time where I stopped taking NR
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.460]   and/or NMN and while I didn't feel
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.740]   as if I was completely depleted of energy,
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.340]   I did notice a decrement in energy
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.700]   compared to when I took NR and NMN.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.820]   Now, I want to be very, very clear.
[00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.580]   I have no zero financial relationship
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.940]   to any company that manufactures NR
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.420]   and while I used to have a relationship
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.820]   to a company that made NMN,
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.280]   as of recently, there's an FDA ruling
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.020]   that has made NMN not available as a supplement
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.380]   in the wider world.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.440]   So earlier this year, that is in 2023,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.320]   there was a filing for NMN
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.500]   as a experimental drug in a clinical trial
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.500]   and as a consequence, NMN was listed as a banned
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.740]   or not allowed to be commercially sold supplement
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.420]   and that has to do with some of the legality
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.100]   around clinical trials
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.700]   and when something is listed as an experimental drug,
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.920]   it can't be listed as a supplement.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.000]   Nonetheless, you can still find NMN on the open market.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.480]   You can find it on Amazon.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.760]   I can't really speak to the purity
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.180]   of one source versus another.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.520]   You'll have to explore that on your own
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.220]   but I will say this, even though I said it before,
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.220]   I have zero financial relationship to any company
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.360]   that manufactures and sells NMN at this time
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.800]   or NR at this time.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.580]   So the short summary to this whole discussion
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.360]   about NR and NMN is that I take NR and NMN
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.160]   but I take it because I like how it makes me feel.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.780]   It increases my energy levels in the morning
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.460]   and throughout the day and it does so in a way
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.140]   that tapers off nicely in the evening
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.220]   and I can still fall asleep, et cetera.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.140]   I do not take it with any expectation
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.980]   that it's going to increase my lifespan
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.180]   simply because I don't think the data substantiating
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.360]   the extension and lifespan are here yet.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.500]   They may arrive at some point
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.940]   but I don't think that they are here yet.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.680]   So there are a good number of people out there
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.100]   that still take NR and or NMN
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.440]   and are doing so in efforts to increase NAD
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.800]   and so let's take a moment
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.820]   and talk about increasing NAD directly
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.180]   because that's something
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.680]   that I have some recent experience with
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.460]   and that's becoming more common
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.960]   and is yes, still FDA approved, at least as far as I know.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.460]   There are companies that can come to your house
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.280]   or you can go to a facility
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.020]   and they will give you an NAD infusion.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.140]   So they will infuse you directly with NAD into the vein.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.520]   I've done this twice now and I will say,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.580]   as most people experience when they do an NAD infusion,
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.060]   it's pretty darn uncomfortable.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.540]   In fact, so much so that a lot of people
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.300]   have to take anti-nausea meds
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.560]   in order to get the NAD infusion.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.360]   I opted to not take the anti-nausea meds
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.480]   not because I'm particularly tough
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.500]   but because I don't like taking additional medication
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.900]   if I can but I've taken anywhere from 500
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:12.620]   to a thousand milligrams of NAD by infusion.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.420]   I did that at times when I was feeling particularly run down.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.780]   Okay, post-illness and I did indeed find
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:23.180]   that after the NAD infusion was complete,
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.740]   I felt much, much better in a number of different ways,
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.720]   improved sleep, improved vigor,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.980]   coming off those illnesses, I felt much better.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.580]   But again, there is no clinical trial exploring NAD infusion
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.420]   for sake of vigor, et cetera, that I am aware of.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.240]   I just happen to be somebody who's interested
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.420]   in exploring these tools and techniques from time to time
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.200]   and I deemed this as safe.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.420]   Whether or not it's safe for you, you have to explore
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.640]   with your physician.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.140]   Also, I do want to reemphasize what I said a moment ago,
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.660]   those NAD infusions are pretty darn uncomfortable.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.420]   You can have the person administering the infusion
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.820]   adjust the rate of the infusion so that the drip is slower
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.940]   which makes it more tolerable as opposed to trying to get
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.040]   the whole infusion bag in there in 45 minutes or less.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.500]   I just want to get the whole thing over with
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.240]   so I just said put it in as quickly as you reasonably
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.620]   and safely can, it took about an hour,
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.420]   maybe 45 minutes to an hour.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.460]   Initially, I felt nauseous, I felt like someone was stepping
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.460]   on my chest, I felt like someone was stepping on my legs,
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:27.000]   I felt like, well, I've just felt lousy, so awful.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.540]   And then after about 10 minutes, it passed and I felt fine.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.380]   And then after the infusion was done, as I mentioned before,
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.600]   I felt terrific.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.300]   I was still able to fall asleep that night just fine.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.480]   Although I did make it a point to do this earlier
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.860]   in the day, I have heard of some people doing NAD infusions
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.840]   later in the day and having challenges with sleep.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.700]   But again, that's just anecdotal or we call it anecdotal
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.660]   if you want, but it's anecdotal.
[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.200]   It's generally assumed for obvious reasons
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.660]   that NAD infusions are more effective
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.740]   at increasing cellular levels of NAD
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.300]   than are NR or NMN or both together.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.300]   Although the direct comparison has not been made
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.260]   as far as I know.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.000]   And there's still this general question as to whether or not
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.660]   any of this stuff is getting into cells directly
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.460]   and impacting NAD levels in specific cells.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.420]   Although I think most people assume
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.220]   that the NAD infusion certainly are.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.580]   There are a number of different experts out there
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.740]   who debate all the fine points of everything
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.900]   that I just said, people like Dr. Charles Brenner,
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.100]   people like Dr. David Sinclair, people like Matt Kaberlein.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.020]   There are people who really actively,
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.300]   and let's just say heatedly debate all the issues
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.260]   that I just talked about.
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.240]   I think the greatest debate is around whether or not
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.800]   increasing NAD levels in cells actually increases lifespan.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.280]   But there's also a debate around whether or not NR
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.420]   is more advantageous than NMN,
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.180]   whether or not all of this is too premature
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.000]   to explore yet already.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.620]   Again, I just want to restate for the third time,
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.920]   I don't do any of this stuff in these NAD pathways
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.000]   for sake of increasing lifespan.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.440]   I do it for sake of the vitality and energy effects
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.680]   that I subjectively experience.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.120]   I must say that the NAD infusions are expensive enough,
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.500]   inconvenient enough, and let's just say uncomfortable enough
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.720]   that I don't see myself doing them very often,
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.220]   although perhaps maybe doing them a couple of times a year
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.660]   or more makes sense.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.380]   Should I find myself feeling rundown
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.820]   or post-illness fatigue or things of that sort?
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.620]   I would be very curious to learn from any of you,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.660]   the audience, what sorts of things you've experienced
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.780]   when if perhaps you've explored NR supplementation,
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.560]   NMN supplementation or NAD infusions.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.620]   And as I mentioned earlier,
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.060]   there's now a growing number of different products
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.580]   that claim that you can take NAD orally,
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.680]   so either in pill, tincture or other forms,
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.300]   so no requirement for an infusion,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.100]   but I'm not aware of any studies
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100]   that have directly linked oral NAD to NAD levels in cells
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.940]   and how those two things relate.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.460]   So lots more important science to be done in this area,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:03.460]   lots more debate surely to be had.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.760]   And anytime we talk about supplements,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.880]   I just want to emphasize several times
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.100]   that I do see supplements as indeed supplements.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.820]   I think only by getting your light exposure,
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.780]   sunshine, movement, nutrition, stress modulation,
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.440]   social relationships, et cetera, correct?
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   Should you even begin to consider supplementation
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.080]   because supplementation is just not at the foundation
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.120]   of mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.500]   It is indeed something that provided it fits
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.700]   within your safety and economical frameworks
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.460]   could potentially enhance mental health,
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.680]   physical health performance in certain ways,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.620]   but it's certainly not the foundation
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.900]   from which you build mental health,
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.640]   physical health and performance.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.720]   So now we've talked about resveratrol,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.100]   a little bit about grapeseed extract.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.000]   We talked about NR, NMN and NAD and the NAD pathway.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.100]   There are a few other things that are commonly discussed
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.360]   in the longevity sphere, let's call it,
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.320]   things such as metformin.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.100]   I'll just be very direct and say, I do not take metformin.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.080]   And I also don't take what some people call
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.200]   the poor man's version of metformin, which is berberine.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.180]   Berberine gives me brutal headaches.
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.860]   Berberine lowers blood glucose.
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.540]   That's why I think it's giving me brutal headaches.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.980]   A lot of people have explored or thinking about exploring,
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.120]   taking metformin or berberine for sake
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.600]   of lowering blood glucose and lowering a particular cellar,
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.200]   let's just say pathway or set of molecules,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.380]   mTOR being the most common of them.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.400]   mTOR mammalian targeted rapamycin
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.880]   is abundant in developing cells.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.420]   It's responsible for the growth of individual cells
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.740]   and the amount of mTOR in our cells tapers off
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.860]   across our lifespan.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.940]   mTOR and its pathways is something
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.780]   that I've actually worked on fairly extensively
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.740]   in my laboratory in the context of the regeneration
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.300]   of the visual system.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.700]   So I'm very familiar with it.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.820]   And for sake of convenience and ease in this conversation,
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.420]   we could just think of mTOR as something
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.060]   that's abundant in cells during development
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.620]   and anytime cells are growing,
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.300]   including the growth of tumor cells
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.200]   and cellular growth at any stage of the lifespan.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.860]   So the logic that people have waged is that drugs
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.980]   like metformin or compounds like berberine
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.140]   that reduce mTOR levels or impact the mTOR pathway
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.440]   in ways that lead to net decreases in mTOR,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.060]   the logic is that that could somehow increase lifespan.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.740]   There's also the logic that fasting can reduce mTOR,
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.100]   which can increase lifespan.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.460]   I don't think there's any direct evidence for that yet,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.480]   however, at least not in humans.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.760]   So I'll tell you, I don't take berberine
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.400]   for the reasons I mentioned before,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.460]   makes me feel uncomfortable.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.620]   I don't, not psychologically uncomfortable,
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.340]   makes me feel physically uncomfortable.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.220]   I don't take metformin because expert colleagues of mine,
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.380]   including Dr. Peter Urrutia have come on this podcast.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.060]   In fact, we did a collaboration journal club podcast
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.340]   that we'll provide a link to in the show note captions
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.380]   during which we, meaning mainly Peter,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.260]   reviewed the data, the peer review data
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.860]   on metformin and lifespan.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.660]   And at least to my understanding at present,
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.900]   there isn't sufficient data to support taking metformin
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.940]   for increasing lifespan.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.340]   So that's why I don't take it.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.520]   I may in the future, if more data come out
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.500]   and things change, but right now I see no reason
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.440]   to take metformin to increase my lifespan.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.220]   So I don't take metformin.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.640]   Similarly, there's a lot of discussion out there
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.700]   about rapamycin.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.100]   Remember mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin is so named
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.620]   because it's a target of this drug,
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.080]   which is used largely as an anti-cancer drug,
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.820]   but has other purposes as well.
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.900]   Rapamycin is actively under investigation,
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.940]   which makes it sound like there was a crime committed,
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.740]   but as far as I know, there wasn't.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.320]   Under active scientific exploration
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.440]   would be the more accurate way to say it,
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.500]   by excellent researchers, such as Dr. Matt Kaberlein
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.820]   up at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.840]   He's been looking at rapamycin for its ability
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.100]   to extend lifespan, focusing on many different species,
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.140]   including dogs.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.360]   So he has a dog longevity project.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.120]   So that's really interesting.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.520]   Dr. Peter Attia has talked a lot about rapamycin
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.860]   and did a recent podcast about rapamycin
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.480]   with not only Matt Kaberlein,
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.900]   but one of the experts in the world on mTOR.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.120]   So I invite you to check out that podcast
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.960]   if you want to learn about rapamycin.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.740]   So there is a fair amount of understanding
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:18.300]   about the biological pathways of rapamycin
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.780]   and mTOR and so on.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.660]   And there are clinician physicians like Peter,
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.620]   as well as others who are quite excited
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.160]   about the potential for rapamycin to extend lifespan.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.560]   Although you have to go directly to Peter
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.160]   to find out exactly what he's doing,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.480]   whether or not he's taking rapamycin or not.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.440]   I certainly can't speak for him.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.880]   But at present, I don't take rapamycin.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.400]   Why don't I take rapamycin?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.160]   Well, I don't take rapamycin because at least to my eye,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.900]   the data at present don't justify that
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.880]   for sake of increasing lifespan.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.060]   That is not to say that rapamycin isn't an effective drug
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.540]   for the treatment of various cancers
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.460]   and for other purposes.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.020]   But for me at this point in time,
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.980]   I just don't see a good reason for me to take rapamycin
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.800]   relative to some of the,
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.840]   let's just say substantiated potential side effects
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.680]   of rapamycin.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.680]   It is a drug that I think can be taken safely
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.040]   under certain conditions,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.160]   but has enough of a side effect profile
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.020]   that I'm not interested in taking it
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.720]   for sake of increasing lifespan at this time, okay?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.280]   So no metformin, no rapamycin for me right now.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.640]   Perhaps in the future.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.000]   I've listed out the things that I'm perfectly willing
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.540]   and happy to do.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.260]   Grapeseed extract, NR and NMN,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:38.820]   the occasional NAD infusion to increase NAD directly.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.720]   And for the time being,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.020]   I've decided to stay away from metformin and rapamycin.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.720]   But of course, any and all of that could change
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   going forward, depending on the data that are published
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.340]   and my own experiences.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.940]   As a final point on this,
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.820]   I want to again emphasize that the foundation
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.520]   of a quality life and a long life
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.100]   is most certainly going to come from the basics.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.400]   Perhaps the most fundamental and important of which
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.140]   is to get sufficient amounts of quality sleep each night.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.820]   We know that not doing that
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.600]   can indeed reduce your lifespan.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.480]   If not directly, then certainly indirectly
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.200]   by increased number of accidents
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.380]   and certainly being far less happy
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.640]   and energetic during the day.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.920]   So that's fundamental also.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.000]   And this is very important to emphasize.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.400]   And here I'm essentially borrowing the word
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.020]   straight out of Dr. Peter Attia's mouth.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.740]   So forgive me, Peter.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.660]   This won't be nearly as eloquent or succinct
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.940]   as Peter would make it.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.920]   But it is very, very clear that at present,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.640]   there is no supplement or drug for increasing longevity
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.780]   that even comes close to the known improvements
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.820]   in health metrics that relate to longevity
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.020]   that come from getting quality sleep
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.860]   and especially from getting sufficient amounts
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.640]   of quality exercise.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.340]   So that means both a combination of cardiovascular exercise,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:59.500]   a minimum of 180 to 220 minutes
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.460]   of so-called zone two cardio per week.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.420]   Okay, so that's cardio that you can carry out
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.020]   while still maintaining a conversation,
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.340]   but should you increase the intensity anymore,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.220]   you would have a hard time completing your sentences.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.820]   But in addition to that, also doing some VO2 max work,
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.140]   so getting your heart rate way, way up
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.500]   at least once per week.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.260]   And also of course, doing resistance training,
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.060]   either with weights, machines, or body weight,
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.900]   doing that at sufficient intensity,
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   six sets minimum per body part per week
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.760]   to maintain not just muscular size and strength,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.940]   but equally important, perhaps even more important,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.340]   maintaining nerve to muscle connectivity,
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.520]   which correlates with cognitive function
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.800]   and a number of other important longevity metrics.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.520]   So again, exercise, sleep, quality nutrition,
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   quality social connection,
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.900]   which means eliminating as best you can
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900]   toxic social connection
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.180]   and increasing quality social connection,
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.300]   people that you like and enjoy spending time with
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.900]   and feel enriched by, stress modulation,
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.220]   all of these things are so key.
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   And of course, getting morning sunlight,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.620]   all of those things combined
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.180]   to have a huge outsized effect compared to anything
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.220]   that you could take in pill capsule or infusion.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.760]   So before even considering taking any supplement or drug
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.900]   to increase your longevity,
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.660]   or even for increasing vitality for that matter,
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.260]   get those basics of sleep, sunlight, nutrition, movement,
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.600]   stress modulation, or stress control, I should say,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.900]   and relationships down.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.840]   Get those right and get that morning sunlight
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.060]   to set your circadian rhythm,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.420]   because of course your circadian rhythm
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.340]   is what anchors it all.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.180]   And I'd be completely remiss if I didn't emphasize yet again
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.920]   that anytime you're thinking of adding a supplement
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.080]   or removing a supplement from your regimen
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.640]   or adding a prescription drug
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.420]   or removing a prescription drug,
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.140]   you absolutely should consult your board certified physician.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.980]   Thank you for joining
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.660]   for the beginning of this Ask Me Anything episode.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.020]   To hear the full episode and to hear future episodes
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.640]   of these Ask Me Anything sessions,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.900]   plus to receive transcripts of them
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.140]   and transcripts of the Huberman Lab Podcast Standard Channel
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   and premium tools not released anywhere else,
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.260]   please go to hubermanlab.com/premium.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.460]   Just to remind you why we launched
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.700]   the Huberman Lab Podcast Premium Channel,
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:13.560]   it's really twofold.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.460]   First of all, it's to raise support
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.960]   for the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast Channel,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.000]   which of course will still be continued to be released
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.680]   every Monday in full length.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.080]   We are not going to change the format
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.660]   or anything about the Standard Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.100]   and to fund research,
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.140]   in particular research done on human beings.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.200]   So not animal models, but on human beings,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.000]   which I think we all agree is a species
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.200]   that we are most interested in.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   And we are going to specifically fund research
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.820]   that is aimed toward developing further protocols
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.880]   for mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.780]   And those protocols will be distributed
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.180]   through all channels, not just the premium channel,
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.880]   but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.180]   and other media channels.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.780]   So the idea here is to give you information
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.980]   to your burning questions in depth
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.140]   and allow you the opportunity to support
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.880]   the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.900]   in the first place.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.240]   Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.180]   is that the tiny foundation has generously offered
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.560]   to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.480]   raised for research through the premium channel.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.080]   So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.040]   whatever funds come in through the premium channel
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.100]   to further support research for science
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.880]   and science related tools for mental health,
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.400]   physical health and performance.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.960]   If you'd like to sign up for the Huberman Lab
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.080]   premium channel, again, there's a cost of $10 per month,
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.840]   or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.160]   That will give you access to all the AMAs.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   You can ask questions and get answers to your questions.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.640]   And you'll of course get answers to all the questions
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.040]   that other people ask as well.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.960]   There will also be some premium content such as transcripts
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.680]   of the AMAs and various transcripts and protocols
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.920]   of Huberman Lab podcast episodes and not found elsewhere.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.240]   And again, you'll be supporting research
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.600]   for mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.000]   You can sign up for the premium channel
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.680]   by going to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.560]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.420]   And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.580]   (upbeat music)
