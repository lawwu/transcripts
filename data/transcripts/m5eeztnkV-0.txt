[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.260]   Once again, John Piper had the privilege of preaching
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.020]   at the Together for the Gospel Conference.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.600]   His address was titled,
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.160]   "The Bondage of the Will, the Sovereignty of Grace,
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.920]   "and the Glory of God."
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.000]   The debate over the freedom of the will
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.180]   was not a secondary one to the Reformation.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.220]   It was central, he argues.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.380]   And the bondage of the will is worthy of our attention
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.720]   because it has everything to do
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.740]   with our loves and our affections.
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.200]   Here's a clip from John Piper's T4G message.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.620]   John 3, 19 to 20.
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.320]   This is the judgment that light has come into the world
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.200]   and people loved.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.760]   It's loved darkness rather than light
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.440]   because it works for evil.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   For everyone who does wicked things hates the light.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.020]   It's a love hate issue.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.360]   It's not a decision issue.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.300]   Hates the light, does not come to the light
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.200]   lest his works should be exposed.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.320]   So the bondage of the human heart
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.380]   that keeps it from coming to Christ
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.160]   is not that light is lacking,
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.160]   but that light is hated and darkness is loved.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.140]   This is a real bondage.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.140]   You cannot embrace as bright and beautiful what you hate.
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.020]   Cannot.
[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:46.620]   You cannot repudiate as dark and ugly what you love.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.820]   You cannot.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.960]   Hate and love are not decisions.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   They are profound controlling preferences
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   of the palate of the soul.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.560]   You don't choose what you love and hate.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.280]   You come into the world hating and loving.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.560]   Darkness tastes good to the natural palate
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   and light tastes bitter to the natural palate.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.540]   You cannot enjoy as sweet what tastes bitter to you
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.140]   and you cannot have a distaste for what tastes good to you.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.480]   You cannot.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.260]   These are real cannots.
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   They are real cannots and they are the kind of cannots,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.080]   the kind of inability that are blameworthy and culpable
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.360]   because they are not things we are forced to do
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   against our will.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.360]   They are our will.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.560]   What is it about darkness?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.160]   Let's ask this.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.280]   I ask, darkness, darkness, what's that?
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.900]   What is there about darkness that we love so much?
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.320]   It tastes so good.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.240]   What is it?
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.760]   I think Jesus tells us,
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.780]   I think probably the deepest part of it,
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.120]   at least part of it.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.920]   John chapter five, verses 43 to 44.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.040]   I have come in my Father's name.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   You don't receive me.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   If another comes in his own name, you'll receive him.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.280]   Now why would that be?
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.040]   This is the key sentence.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.300]   It's a rhetorical question.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.940]   What do you do with rhetorical questions?
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.220]   They don't have any answer 'cause what?
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.900]   He expects you to know the answer
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.260]   by converting the rhetorical question
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.020]   into a statement that's clear as day.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.540]   So here's the question that he asks.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.100]   How can you, the Jewish leaders, how can you?
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.620]   The word can, can, not whatever.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.620]   How can you believe when you receive glory
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.340]   from one another and do not seek the glory
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.060]   that comes from the only God?
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.000]   Meaning you can't.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.820]   Why?
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.320]   It tastes too good to be praised by people.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.860]   I love this.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.500]   And here comes Jesus on his way
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.960]   to a cross bidding me to follow.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.320]   That's insane.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.360]   That's foolish.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.200]   I'll stumble over that 'cause I love the praise of men.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.360]   Oh, I love this darkness.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   It tastes so good.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.300]   That's what Jesus says is the heart of darkness.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.040]   How can you believe on me, a dying,
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.640]   self-denying, sacrificial lamb?
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640]   How can you believe on me when you love the praise of men?
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.360]   You can't.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.440]   That's what you can't.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.440]   This is bondage.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.940]   This is called bondage to our loves.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.840]   I am the light of the world that ends all this darkness.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.600]   That craving is ugly in my light.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.640]   That tastes wretched.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.000]   That bondage, that craving for approval,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.480]   that need of other people to make much of me,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.600]   that tastes horrid in my light.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.680]   This is a real kenner.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.520]   You are in bondage to the love
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.000]   of the darkness of self-glorification.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.080]   - Wow, can we hear that message too often?
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.160]   I have to be honest about that.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.400]   This is good.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.440]   And it points us to the sweetness of regeneration
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.040]   in giving us new desires to find our souls satisfied
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.680]   with the beauty of Christ.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.360]   And that is, of course, the theme behind everything we do
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.640]   at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.480]   This clip was taken from John Piper's conference message
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.000]   at T4G titled, "The Bondage of the Will,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   "The Sovereignty of Grace, and the Glory of God."
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.940]   You can find the message at DesiringGod.org.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.520]   Tomorrow we will return to talk about
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.700]   Pastor John's brand new book,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.240]   and we will carry on this theme
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.800]   of how my affections expose the true me.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.760]   We'll see you then.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
