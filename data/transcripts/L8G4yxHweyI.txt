[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   All right, let's move on here. Shane asks about effective and speedy Zoom meetings.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Contradiction in terms, I don't know if that's possible.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Let's get some more details here.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   He's in some group. They had their first meeting with 12 members.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And while the agenda was set and the reports were sent out prior to the meeting,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   it still took nearly two hours. And so Shane is frustrated with Zoom meetings.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Yeah, look, here's the thing about meetings like that.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   First of all, meetings with 12 people where everyone gets to just talk are a huge waste of time.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So the idea is we have like a 12 person board and let's all just get together and kind of discuss things and figure things out.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   That's a huge waste of time.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's better to say, OK, there's one person going to present this thing and here's our proposal.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And then we have like a 15 minute Q&A period and then a suggestion is going to be made.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So more structure there really matters.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   In general, having more processes for work before the meetings make a big deal.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So the more you're trying to accomplish ad hoc and on the fly in the meeting itself,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   the more the meeting is going to be dragged out and frustrating.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And the more you say this is our mechanisms for making decisions, the more that's in place ahead of time,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   the more focused and effective your meetings can be.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So if there's some process ahead of time for here are the motions being proposed
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   and there will be a 10 minute discussion of the motion at one meeting.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Then there's going to be a period of, I don't know, I'm just making this up, of like back and forth, whatever.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   People are marking up with emails or thoughts in like a shared doc, how they feel about it.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And then a concrete proposal is brought up for a vote at the next meeting.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There's a 10 minute Q&A portion and then the vote happens on something specific.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   What I'm talking about here is like really clear processes for how things happen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We're part of the process is like a here's where discussion happens.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   This type of discussion on this piece for this long.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That gives you a lot more control as opposed to let's just figure this all out in the meeting.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Once you have more than three people, that's not going to go very well.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   The other thing that's really useful is to make everything concrete.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Okay, we're talking about this topic in this meeting.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Here's a shared screen where I'm taking notes.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   This conversation is going to conclude with a clear action item assigned to someone.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So when people know that like this is live ammo they're playing with,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   they're usually a lot more circumspect and careful about just let me just chime in and bloviate.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   When it's like, here's the thing we're trying to get to, like this person is going to do this thing.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Makes it more serious that they think like we're just time wasting.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Like let's all just talk about it and hopefully this dies away without me having to do more work.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So it's like, okay, here's our goal.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I'm going to take notes on what people are saying.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We're going to clarify.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Okay, let me clarify.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Then let me propose that these will be the next steps.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   What do we think about it?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Okay, we changed it.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Great.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Jack is going to do it.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Move on.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So be really clear.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Everything you're discussing is wrapped up.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It's written down, wrapped up, summarized, and assigned.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   All right.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Zoom effective and speedy Zoom meetings.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Not a lot of those.
