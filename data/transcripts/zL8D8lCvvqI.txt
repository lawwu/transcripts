[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   How do we parent through family crisis?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.320]   In today's scenario, a husband and a wife are at odds.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.800]   Son is pitted against father.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.240]   Daughter is pitted against her mother.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560]   Even the daughter-in-law sides with the daughter against mom.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.600]   And all of the compounded animosities towards the mother weigh heavy on the father.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.760]   It all appears that a man's worst enemies are inside of his own home.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.040]   So when a family breaks apart like this, what is a man to do?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.440]   This scenario is what makes the 7th chapter of Micah so bleak.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.580]   It's the worst of times.
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.600]   The culture is fracturing apart due to sin.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.360]   No one can trust anyone.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.480]   Closer to home, families are falling into crisis.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   It is a time, warns Micah, to "put no trust in a neighbor, have no confidence in a friend,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   guard the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your arms."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.020]   From a wife, that is.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020]   For the son treats the father with contempt.
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560]   The daughter rises up against her mother.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800]   The daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.520]   A man's enemies are the men of his own house.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.880]   As Micah 7, verses 5-6.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.280]   Considering the pain of such chaos in society and in the home, Micah models two things in
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.560]   verse 9.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.960]   He honestly reckons with himself and he lays hold of his hope in God.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.600]   "I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.800]   Until he pleads my cause and executes judgment for me, he will bring me out to the light.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.640]   I shall look upon his vindication."
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.480]   Here's Pastor John in a 2010 sermon explaining this text's relevance for the broken family
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.920]   today.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:12.840]   What makes verse 9 at the beginning so stunning, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord because
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.720]   I have sinned" is because he says it in the vortex of being sinned against.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.680]   You know this is one of the hardest things in the world, don't you?
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.480]   Friends, family, work.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   It is impossible without the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   So he knows he's being sinned against.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.920]   He knows some of the accusations against him are wrong.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.480]   He is going to be vindicated in something.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.160]   And he knows that God is for him and not against him.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400]   God will bring him out into the light out of darkness.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   He will vindicate him so he's bold in his confidence in this assertion.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   Amazingly bold.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.040]   Nevertheless, nevertheless, what he draws attention to, to explain the Lord's indignation
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   is his own sin.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.160]   "I will bear the indignation of the Lord because I have sinned against him."
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640]   So my answer to the question, why is he brokenhearted?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.840]   I'm arguing that the posture for parenting with hope in the worst of times is a brokenhearted
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.360]   boldness and I'm asking first, why is he brokenhearted?
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   And the center of the answer, the core of the answer is not their sin against him but
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.880]   his sin against God.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   That's the core of his answer.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.960]   And that's the core of parenting.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   It's the core of parenting.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.240]   If it doesn't happen, nothing else is going to go right.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.080]   Nothing.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.120]   Wives and husbands, here it begins.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.040]   Or here it starts over.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.080]   The posture of parenting with hope in the worst of times is the posture of brokenhearted
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.600]   boldness and the brokenheartedness is first, centrally because of his own sin.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.080]   That is a great battle that we face and we can only find it by God's grace.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:29.680]   I pray for you, God, grant that all of us would be given the miracle by the Holy Spirit
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.760]   of the kind of humility that in the midst of being sinned against, mainly emotionally
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.800]   owns our sin against God.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.320]   Miracle.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.080]   Healing miracle.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.000]   The kind of thing that could give hope where you thought there was none.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.640]   None.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.620]   When you stand before God on the judgment day to give an account, guess what?
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.680]   He will not give you one minute to itemize the sins against you.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.960]   Not one.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   For several reasons.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.140]   Number one, he has a book.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.760]   He doesn't need your help.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   Number two, you'd get it wrong.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.800]   Your memory's not good enough.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.840]   Number three, you'd use it for self-justification.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   You don't get one minute at the last day to talk about anybody else's sin.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   None.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.280]   Just your own.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.960]   So how do you parent in the worst of times with hope?
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.880]   How do you parent with hope when the family is divided three to two?
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.560]   Two to three.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.440]   You look to the Lord, you cry to the Lord, verse seven, and then you cry to him with
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:57.240]   two deep, spirit-wrought, word-informed convictions.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.160]   Are you getting there?
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.000]   Only God can get you there.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.840]   Preaching helps, but only God can get you there.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.280]   I'm trying to build into your life right now, as parents, or to be parents, or every single
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:16.960]   people, I'm trying to build two deep convictions, governing convictions, emotionally effective
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   convictions.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.080]   Two of them, broken-hearted boldness.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.320]   A conviction, "My sin is my biggest problem.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.640]   My sin is our marriage problem.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.920]   My sin is my parenting problem.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.520]   My sin is my work problem.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   My sin is the church's problem, and I don't deserve anything from God."
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.100]   We are not and never will be perfect parents.
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.080]   We have sin.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.960]   Call it anything you want to soften it.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.360]   We're not foolish.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   We're not naive.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.000]   We know we've been sinned against.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.480]   Wives sinned against us.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.880]   Children sinned against us.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.920]   Pastors sinned against us.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.440]   We know that.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.280]   That's just not the core of our issue.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.760]   God will not call me to account for anybody's sin against me, none.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.720]   He will call me to account for one thing.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.840]   How have I responded?
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.920]   Have I been a sinner?
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.460]   And I have.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.240]   Only the Holy Spirit can make us feel this guilt as we should deep down.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.480]   So that's the first conviction I'm praying that God would work in our hearts.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.200]   Number two, there is no God like our God.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.760]   I want you to be so deeply convinced that he pardons iniquity, he passes over transgression,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   he relents from anger, he delights in steadfast love.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.620]   I want you to be just as deeply convinced of that as that you are a sinner.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.940]   Do you see how these work together?
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.220]   This is so important.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.900]   Get the next 60 seconds.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.380]   Deep, deep sense of conviction for my own sin in the midst of being sinned against.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:01.660]   I'm emotionally governed here by my own failures and I am being humbled by that.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.760]   That's a miracle.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.660]   And over here is a massive, strong, unshakable conviction.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.020]   This God that rules the world pardons iniquity.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.180]   Do you see how they work together?
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.700]   This one causes me to be more amazed at the pardon.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.540]   But unless I'm confident in the pardon, I'm going to lie to myself.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.540]   I am.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.580]   I'm going to short circuit this conviction.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.380]   I will not let it go to the bottom.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.260]   I can't because it's devastating.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.100]   It's just too devastating unless I got this fixed.
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.340]   Got that?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.180]   You got how they work together?
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.180]   It won't work.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.860]   You can't have a God you're super excited about because of his pardon if you don't go
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.100]   here.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.460]   And you can't go here unless you've got a God who's super excited, who's super exciting
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.460]   in his pardon.
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.180]   And if you say, "That's, that's, that's, uh, that won't work."
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.020]   I'm saying it's a miracle.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.700]   It's a miracle.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.500]   I can't explain the Christian life.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.740]   I can't explain the new birth.
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.940]   I can't explain conviction of sin.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.940]   I can't explain how God shows up and does two things that depend on each other at the
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.940]   same time.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.940]   He does.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.660]   Most of you have tasted it.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.220]   You have.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.780]   You need to go deeper, but almost all of you in this room, I would guess, have tasted what
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.560]   I'm talking about.
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:23.620]   So those two deep convictions, brokenhearted boldness, are what I mean by parenting with
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.900]   hope in the worst of times.
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:33.180]   We assume a posture in the vortex of being sinned against, and we don't even know, is
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.260]   it mainly me or mainly them?
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.660]   I can't even figure this out, right?
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.660]   We don't even know.
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.500]   But in that vortex, we own what we know.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.140]   I'm a sinner, and he's a great Savior.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.660]   So how do you close?
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:55.420]   You close by saying, "Okay, we're Christians, and we know now that from this side of the
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:04.380]   cross, if I look at that where God bought my pardon, both of these are intensified,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.860]   aren't they?
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.220]   Not lessened, intensified."
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.020]   You don't really know how grievous your sin is until you watch Jesus die for it.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.180]   You don't.
[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.180]   You can't.
[00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.280]   You just can't know how bad it is.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.680]   You can't feel how bad it is.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.300]   The whole point of how gory the cross is is how gory my sin is.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   That's the whole point.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.500]   You just can't know.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.860]   Therefore Christians have an edge on guilt.
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.940]   We're bitter at it.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.160]   Hopefully.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.500]   We should be the guiltiest people on the planet.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.020]   We should be more devastated than anybody.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:51.840]   We've seen the glory of the cross and the confidence level of our hearts that he passes
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:11:01.380]   over this horror should rise with every scream from his mouth on the cross.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.860]   So on this side of the cross, what changes is now we see the price that was paid.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:13.380]   It intensifies how wretched I am, and it intensifies how utterly committed our covenant God is
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.660]   to pay for it and draw us into his family in spite of it.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.300]   It's just incredible.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.540]   And you know, for Micah, Jesus was just a prophecy.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.540]   You remember it?
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.020]   I'll read it to you.
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.420]   It's chapter 5, verse 1 or 2.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:42.220]   But you, O Bethlehem, from you shall come forth one for me who is to be ruler in Israel.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.420]   He shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord.
[00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.060]   That shepherd laid down his life for the sheep.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:00.820]   And now we see in that the greatest clarity of our sin and God's commitment to rescue
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.140]   us from it.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.140]   Christ took our judgment.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.940]   As humbling and hope-giving, this excerpt came to us from an anonymous man who is parenting
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.540]   through family crisis right now.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.220]   And that's the title of the sermon, which this excerpt came from, "Parenting Through
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.140]   Family Crisis," a John Piper sermon preached on March 21st, 2010.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.500]   The whole message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.420]   Well, thanks for listening to today's clip.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.400]   If you have a clip ministering to you right now, send it to us.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.580]   You tell us what bits of Piper sermons are impacting you, and we share that clip with
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   others.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.580]   If you've got one, email me.
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.300]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the timestamp of where the clip happens in
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.100]   the audio, and tell me how it impacted you.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.580]   Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.580]   That's an email address, AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.980]   Well, what does it feel like to be abandoned by God?
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.180]   Or can we even say that?
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.980]   Does God abandon us ever, or is this only a felt experience?
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.780]   We have several questions on the topic, historically called "spiritual desertion," and I'll pose
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.100]   those questions to Pastor John next time.
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.180]   We'll see you then.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:15.680]   [END]
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   1.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.680]   What is the meaning of "spiritual desertion?"
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.680]   2.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   What is the meaning of "spiritual destruction?"
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   3.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.680]   What is the meaning of "spiritual desertion?"
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.680]   4.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   What is the meaning of "spiritual destruction?"
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   5.
