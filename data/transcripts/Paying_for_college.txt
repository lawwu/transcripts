[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Hello everybody, it's Sam and Sydney from Financial Samurai and this episode
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.640]   we want to talk about the different ways to pay for college as well as my blind spot and also your thoughts on
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.880]   college expenses going forward. So Sydney, what are your thoughts about the price of college today?
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.000]   Oh boy, it's it's crazy. The prices are out of control
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.020]   I mean we both went to state school and we were fortunately able to have low tuition
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.960]   But even I feel like even state tuition these days, it's not cheap. College is expensive
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.000]   No, yeah, when we went to William & Mary the tuition was
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.120]   $2,800 to
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.040]   $3,500 in tuition a year and now William & Mary I just looked is about
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.200]   18,000 a year which actually seems
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   reasonable because tuition for
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.840]   Yeah private universities it was like
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.200]   58,000 in tuition a year still not cheap. Oh and I just looked at the William & Mary website and then there's
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.640]   $6,536 in fees. So the tuition is really more like
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.160]   25,000 and then plus
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.960]   13,500 for housing and food books travel and incidentals. So that's about
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.400]   41,000 a year in state out of state is
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.680]   64,000
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.160]   $346 ouch, but still cheaper than private universities
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.600]   58,000 a year in tuition and then adding up everything is more like
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.640]   $83,000 a year. I just looked at Boston University where Democratic Socialist
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.160]   Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.720]   83,000 a year. I don't know what kind of middle-class or socialist person can afford that kind of tuition
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   So it seems to me only the really rich or the poor are able to comfortably afford to
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.040]   send their kids to college because the poor will get financial aid good financial aid in terms of grants and scholarships and
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.080]   The rich can afford anything they want and then there's a whole swath of people in
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   between and so for me
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.200]   I have had a constant desire to save and plan for the future because I like to plan things out
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.480]   I like to do the pro forma calculations to see how much we have to save
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.640]   For the future and we have now a six-year-old and a three-year-old
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.480]   So that means potentially our son will go to college in 12 years in the year
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.720]   2036 and so what I did was I looked at the most expensive private school out there and
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.840]   Then times it by four and I got to three hundred twenty thousand dollars and then I used a five percent annual compound
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.040]   Growth rate over the next twelve years to come up with about six hundred eighty five thousand dollars
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.920]   Total cost for him to go to school. What do you think about that? It's a scary number
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.400]   It's really scary. So I really don't know any
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.960]   middle-class family that can comfortably afford
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.520]   $320,000 in today's dollars and why am I using the most expensive?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.720]   Assumptions. Well, there are several reasons one
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.520]   Unlikely for our children to get scholarships due to intelligence or merit. What do you think about that reality? I
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   Think it's better to be conservative
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.000]   Yeah better to be conservative and save too much then end up with too little if you look at us
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.920]   Did we get any scholarships to attend William & Mary? I had a one-time
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.720]   $800 scholarship
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.480]   $800 baby, that's pretty good paid for some pizza at the cafeteria for a couple months
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.180]   No, that's decent $800 because tuition was for you. You're three years earlier than me. So that's like
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.660]   23% off tuition. Yeah, I did get a scholarship. I remember I thought I didn't get a scholarship, but I got a
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.540]   $500
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.860]   Language scholarship excellent and for Mandarin to study abroad in China my junior year. Okay, but other than that
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.940]   Because of our average intelligence, we didn't get any merit scholarship
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.140]   There's this what the scholar building remember the Monroe scholars
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.020]   Those folks got like 3,000 or 5,000 most of them are valedictorians, I think yeah, so that that wasn't us
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:25.580]   Also, we probably have below personality, you know below average personalities. Okay. I don't know about your personality, but nothing stellar
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.140]   Yeah, Harvard, you know have said that Asian people have below average personalities
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.860]   So so I guess our children will have below average personalities
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.540]   And this is a way for private schools to throttle Asian academic performance
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.820]   so given our children are Asian or
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.260]   mixed despite their work ethic
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.500]   Friendliness general peaceful nature not causing violence and harm in the society
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.820]   Asians are not the preferred minority colleges want to V for and fight for ooh and another thing
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.620]   So half my family is from Hawaii
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.580]   And the other half is from Taiwan and so our children have Hawaiian blood
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.220]   I have looked at our my parents birth certificates my grandparents birth certificates. They say Chinese Hawaiian
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:22.580]   However, despite the desire for diversity and inclusion by colleges Pacific Islanders and Hawaiians still seem to be lumped together with Asians
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.300]   Despite huge cultural differences. Yeah, definitely
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.860]   so it seems like there's not gonna be any kind of advantage being a Pacific Islander either even though
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.820]   Pacific Islanders only account for 0.4 percent of the American population, right?
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.500]   but I do think maybe they are
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.380]   differentiating between
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.940]   People of the Pacific Islands and the many many different Asian cultures
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.220]   They should the cultures are totally different, but let's just say they don't you know, cuz we're all we're all like, right?
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.340]   We all look alike walk same culture, right? That that's what society said
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.340]   And then our children are like unlikely to win sports scholarships
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.380]   I think only like 1% of high school students win sports scholarships
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   There's also a decline in merit based
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.980]   Excellence and reward right in terms of it doesn't matter how hard our children try to get good grades and test scores
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:26.960]   Yeah, they're not looking at them they're you know banishing or removing SAT and ACT is optional because you know
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   We got it all equalized
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.980]   And then although our incomes are not high our assets are above average because we've been prodigious savers and investors since 1999
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.140]   Since the day I had my first job and I needed to get the hell out
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.660]   So it's a long-winded answer to say why I am expecting to pay
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.180]   $320,000 in today's dollars and
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.260]   almost
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260]   $700,000 in the year
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.460]   2036 to
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.820]   2040 but here's the thing we have two children
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.900]   And then our second one is three three years younger than our first so
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.020]   700,000 plus maybe 800,000 is 1.5 million dollars
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.740]   So imagine the average American household
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.460]   two children white picket fence
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:26.860]   Three bedroom two bath house has to face 1.5 million dollars in college expenses for their two children
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.980]   It isn't feasible so that's why I think there has to be this greater anxiety
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:41.420]   There is this anxiety to save and work to pay for college tuition, and I think it's a great idea to work
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.260]   through
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.860]   College so until your kids graduate college just keep on working
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.980]   I think that's a normal and very common target for people to have
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.980]   But we don't have that because we stopped doing official work back in 2012 for me and
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.940]   2015 for you as a result we've had to really focus on trying to save and
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:11.420]   Invest as much as possible in their respective five to nine accounts to somehow get to these figures that seem
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.740]   Unbelievable right now, you know seven hundred thousand four years and eight hundred thousand for four years for our son and daughter
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.580]   It seems unbelievable now, but that's the math
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.340]   And since math don't lie
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:29.820]   this stress and anxiety to try to save over a million dollars or 1.5 million dollars in 12 to
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.900]   15 years is immense. Yeah, but I
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:40.420]   Realize there's another way because I read Ron Lieber's book the price you pay for college and in the book
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.820]   He highlights this financial aid expert fellow named Mark
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.100]   Trowitz and he says look there are four ways to pay for college
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:57.380]   The first way is parents pay one quarter of tuition from college savings like a five to nine plan or Roth IRA
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:03.380]   Two parents pay one quarter of tuition from their current income during the four years of college
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.980]   Three students borrow one quarter of tuition from the federal government or through work study they pay for it and then four
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.780]   Parents borrow the rest from home equity or through a federal plus loan or private lender
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.180]   So if you have these ways of borrowing and paying for college
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.660]   Then you don't have to we don't have to save and invest
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.220]   1.5 million dollars
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.660]   Now, did you realize there were these four ways to pay did it even enter your head?
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.380]   I didn't really think about it. All I really was remembering is that I had to pay half of
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.980]   My tuition my parents paid for the other half and they let me know pretty early on that
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:50.900]   They wouldn't be able to afford the entire amount so I would be on the hook for the other half after I graduated
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:59.060]   Oh, so you actually did take student loans and now I remember right who paid your student loan off big daddy
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.060]   I think it was $10,000. I
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.220]   Remember I had like a bonus check and I said, you know what? I'm gonna pay your student along
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.860]   Yes, I've totally forgot about that. So it was your parents paid work through that half
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.220]   You paid like maybe a third a third and student loans a third
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.820]   Something like that
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:26.860]   Okay. Okay. So so you you did a conventional way for me my parents paid the twenty eight hundred dollars a
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.900]   Year in tuition and then the room and board so it came out to about nine thousand a year
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.620]   But I did pay them back just over time through you know, my work checks
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.100]   but this is the one thing that I didn't realize until reading this book and
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:47.620]   That bullet point his parents paying for college from their income while their children are attending college, right?
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:53.940]   Did you think about that because that sounds like if you read it and you listen you're like, oh no kidding. That's common
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.940]   Right, right. I think it's just
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.820]   The way we operate is very unconventional
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:06.140]   Now so I think that's why it didn't come to mind. I mean, it sounds like a no-brainer, right folks
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.900]   But I didn't think about that option at all
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.380]   Because I haven't had a day job in 11 years
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:20.620]   Right, and you haven't had a day job in almost eight years. I think eight years. Yeah, and I'm not even motivated to work now
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.420]   so
[00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:28.940]   What what makes me think that I'm gonna want to work 12 to 15 years from now when I'm like 57
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.860]   58 9. Yeah, there's no way in heck. I want to be working then and also I
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.300]   Don't want to be borrowing when I'm in my late 50s for college, right? Because there's a chance
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:46.660]   Did you know that 40% of kids who go to college don't end up graduating within six years?
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.140]   That's really high or graduating at all
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:54.140]   So there's a risk to taking on debt to get a college education
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.340]   That you don't receive right and hence why we have such like, you know
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.920]   1.8 trillion in student loans and there's this big fear about student loan forgiveness and all that, right?
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.200]   so one of the lessons and realizations I have is if you plan to
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.340]   Achieve fire retire early do something new and you have kids
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:21.220]   There's is this kind of dichotomy between your future expenses and what you want to do now and how you want to earn money
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.300]   And so you really need enough passive income to cover these future expenses
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.820]   It's not static folks, especially if you have young kids and our fire
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.140]   It's ever-growing with the cost of health care insurance, right? We pay how much a month?
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.780]   2400 and then you know, obviously the cost of tuition
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.900]   Which you know, the worst case is right now about three hundred twenty thousand over four years
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.140]   So if you're thinking about short-circuiting your active income
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:53.820]   then on the back end, please be very
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.060]   critical very
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:02.620]   Detail-oriented on exactly potentially what your expenses are in the future now in terms of how much you
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.260]   Should save for college for each child
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:13.740]   That's an individual choice. The most conservative way is to follow our way and to save for four years at the most
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:20.260]   Expensive private university and assume no scholarships just low expectations, which means high cost
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.220]   The other I think reasonable way is to save for four years worth of your state
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:31.300]   flagship school in-state tuition and if your child wants to go to a
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:38.700]   Fancy-spancy private university and it costs more than have them pay the difference put that skin in the game
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:44.260]   Or you don't even have to pay for you know, or save for four years of in-state tuition
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.580]   You could have a combination as well. What I think we should all be is
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.100]   Dynamic and flexible to see how our children are. We'll figure it out by the time
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.660]   They're in middle school in high school. Are they studios? Do they appreciate hard work?
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:04.980]   Do they want to go into a profession that requires a lot of schooling? Are they frugal? Are they spendy all these things?
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:12.020]   Should be taken into consideration in terms of where they should go to school and how much we should pay
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.740]   What are your thoughts and other ways we should?
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:21.460]   Consider paying one other thing that comes to mind is some families choose to have their kids
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:27.900]   Continue to live at home while they go through college and obviously that's not going to be the right fit for every family
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.740]   But it certainly is a way to save on
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.300]   Room and board. Yeah, and also to go to community college for two years
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:41.460]   Some states community college is free and then you do well and you can transfer over to hopefully a better
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.100]   University and give yourself a second chance at getting good grades
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:51.860]   The other way is doing ROTC, you know, they pay for partial scholarship
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:58.980]   So that's pretty good as well. And another way where we've discussed before is using a Roth IRA to pay for college
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.440]   However, I'm not that big of a fan because the Roth IRA is meant for you and your retirement
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   So put on your seat belt first
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.220]   Before trying to help others. In conclusion
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.740]   I understand if you are feeling any type of anxiety about trying to afford the full
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.180]   Four-year cost of tuition. The good thing is the sticker price is often different from the net price
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.740]   Most families don't pay the sticker price
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.580]   It's something like 70 to 80 percent of families don't pay the sticker price because they have some type of financial aid
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.740]   Hopefully majority good financial aid in terms of free money and not student loans
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.060]   But if you're feeling that anxiety and you feel like you have to save for the entire four years
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.540]   Well, don't be like me and be so one-tracked instead
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.340]   Think about a team effort in paying for college through your savings and investing
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.700]   Through your child's work and savings because after all we're going to teach them, you know
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:03.080]   To work hard and contribute to a Roth IRA and so forth and also to pay for college
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.900]   From your passive or active income. I totally didn't think about that, but that
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.580]   Maybe we we might have or some some families might have half or enough
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:20.460]   Active and passive income to pay for college while our children are in college
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.140]   So I hope you enjoyed this episode in an X episode
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:32.260]   Perhaps we'll talk about how to get free money how to quote game the college financial aid
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.700]   System so that you can gain free money. It's not easy. I went through this whole exercise
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.820]   We should all be thinking about how the system works
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.300]   But stay tuned for a next episode if you enjoyed this episode
