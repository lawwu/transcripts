[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   The following is a conversation with Vitalik Buterin,
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.240]   his second time on the podcast.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.480]   Vitalik is the co-founder of Ethereum
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.860]   and one of the most influential people in cryptocurrency
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.240]   and technology broadly defined.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.360]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320]   Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.840]   Four Sigmatic, and BetterHelp.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.280]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.800]   As a side note, let me say that Ethereum, Bitcoin,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.240]   and many other cryptocurrencies have been taking a wild ride
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.100]   of prices going up and down in the past few months.
[00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.700]   To me, the prices were never as important as the ideas,
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.140]   both technical and philosophical.
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.720]   Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.600]   of people to participate in the global economy
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.660]   in a way that resists the manipulation by centralized power.
[00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.000]   Also with smart contracts, layer two technologies,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.560]   data pools, NFTs, and of course,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.080]   integration of artificial intelligence into the whole thing,
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.240]   we have the opportunity to build tools and worlds
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.720]   that transform physical and digital life as we know it,
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   hopefully minimizing the suffering in the world
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.520]   and maximizing the fun.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.000]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.560]   and here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.160]   Let's first talk about Shiba Inu, if we can.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.320]   Also known as Shiba Token, code SHIB.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.440]   For context, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.960]   modeled off of Dogecoin by the anonymous founder
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.360]   known as Ryoshi.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.160]   On May 10th this year, it had a market capitalization
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.300]   of over 13 billion.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.440]   And maybe you can explain this, but in a crazy move,
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.780]   you were given half of SHIB's total supply.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.480]   You burned, aka destroyed, 90% of it,
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   that's worth $6.7 billion,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.500]   and you donated 10%, that's worth 1.2 billion at the time,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.400]   to an India COVID-19 relief fund,
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.760]   saying you don't want to be the locus of this much power.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   This is fascinating.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.620]   Why and how were you able to walk away
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.600]   from this much money and this much power?
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.880]   - So I should probably start by giving
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.000]   some of the backstory around these coins
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.580]   and this concept of giving me coins.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.440]   So first of all, Shiba Inu, as you said,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.800]   is this kind of knockoff of Dogecoin, right?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.480]   And Dogecoin was this initial fun coin
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   that was created back, I think, around 2014 or so.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.000]   And it was just created by Jackson Palmer
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240]   and put it out as a joke for a couple of hours
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.960]   and a community formed around it.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.680]   And at the beginning, people didn't take it very seriously.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.040]   I actually remember putting about $25,000 into Doge
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.360]   sometime around 2016, and I just remember
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.160]   thinking to myself, like, okay,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.880]   how am I going to explain to my mom
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.480]   that I just invested $25,000 into dog coins?
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.000]   And like, what even are dog coins?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.300]   Like, the only interesting thing about this coin
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.840]   is that there's a logo of a dog somewhere.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.440]   But of course, that ended up being
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.120]   one of the best investments I've ever made.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.880]   And it did really well.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600]   And then at the end of 2020, Elon Musk, of course,
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   started talking about Dogecoin
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   and the market cap just shot up to about $50 billion.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.720]   Actually, it shot up multiple times, right?
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.920]   Like the first time it went up from about 0.8 cents
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.720]   to about like seven cents.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.160]   And this just happened all in one day.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.420]   And I remember this was when I was still in Singapore
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.260]   in the middle of COVID.
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260]   And I saw that the price just went up by a thousand percent.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.180]   And I was like, oh my God, my Doge is worth like a lot.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.820]   And so I immediately called up some of my friends
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.460]   and told them to like drop everything and scramble.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.100]   And I just sold half the Doge.
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.340]   And I got $4.3 million,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.340]   donated the proceeds to GiveDirectly.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640]   And a few hours after I did this,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.780]   the price dropped back down
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.460]   from about seven cents to four cents, right?
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.100]   So I managed to sell the Doge at the top.
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.900]   And I remember just feeling like I was
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.260]   such an amazing trader.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.740]   But then of course, the price went up from four cents
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.980]   then to seven and then 50 and just like Doge
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.820]   becoming this big phenomenon
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.980]   where there's even a lot of people that have heard of Doge
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.100]   that have not heard of Ethereum.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.820]   It's just like something even I wasn't predicting, right?
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.980]   And so after that, of course, we have Doge
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.140]   and then people are thinking, well,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.580]   if the leading dog token is worth $50 billion,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.460]   surely the second largest dog token deserves,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.980]   you know, at least seven or eight billion, right?
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.980]   I feel like that's the kind of what the mindset
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.540]   of these Shiba people is.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.020]   So that of course, they did this other gimmick, right?
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.840]   Where they gave me half the Shiba token supply.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.420]   They were actually not the first projects to do this.
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.980]   So around the end of 2020,
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.700]   there was this weird project called Teller.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.340]   It's like T-E-L-L-O-R.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.020]   I think they're a Chainlink competitor
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.220]   or something like this.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.140]   But I remember they just like dumped $50,000 worth
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.740]   of their token into my wallet.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.100]   And then they had their Twitter army
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.020]   just like basically run around saying,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.340]   look, look at Vitalik's wallet.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.460]   Vitalik holds Teller's.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.300]   He's one of us.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.280]   He's a supporter.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.740]   And as soon as I discovered this,
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.460]   I just like publicly sold the Teller tokens on Uniswap.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.400]   And this created a bit of a Twitter splat.
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.820]   Now, the Shiba people were more clever.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.180]   The Shiba people, instead of dumping to that wallet,
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.420]   they dumped to my cold wallet, right?
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.460]   So in a cryptocurrency, right,
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.660]   there's this concept of cold wallets and hot wallets.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.560]   Basically, the thing that actually owns your money
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.740]   is like this 80-digit number called a private key, right?
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.500]   And a hot wallet is when that private key
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.420]   is just stored in memory on your computer, on your phone,
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.780]   really easy to access.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.760]   Cold wallet means it's either written down
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.820]   on a piece of paper or it's on a computer
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.060]   that's just never accessed the internet, right?
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.420]   So cold is very inconvenient,
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.620]   but cold is also much more secure, right?
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.740]   Because even if that computer has some viruses on it,
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.900]   like it's air-gapped,
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.820]   it's not actually going to be able to upload it.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.780]   So this cold wallet,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.300]   and like all the money is out of the cold wallet,
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.460]   so it's safe for me to talk about my setup now, right?
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.580]   But it was a laptop that was sitting in Canada.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.940]   And I also had two pieces of paper
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.580]   where I wrote down two numbers
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:33.860]   on those two pieces of paper.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.740]   One was with me, one was in Canada.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.380]   And if you add those two numbers together,
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.780]   you get the private key.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.340]   So because of COVID travel restrictions,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.260]   and this cold wallet's in Canada,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.020]   like it's very difficult for me to actually access it, right?
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.980]   And I'm not sure if they knew this,
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.140]   maybe they just got lucky,
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.860]   but basically they sent a lot of these dog tokens
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.460]   into this wallet where it was very difficult
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.420]   for me to access it.
[00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.420]   But then I saw these dog tokens,
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.120]   I saw more and more people talking about them.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.940]   And then at some point I realized that like,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.260]   hey, these things are worth billions of dollars.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.860]   And like, you know, there's lots of really good things
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.100]   that you could do with that amount of money.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.140]   And it would actually be a waste to just like see it go.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.740]   So I made the decision that like,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.260]   I would actually power through and figure out
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.940]   how to like safely, like basically get my private key.
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.260]   I actually had to call up my family,
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.220]   tell them to read out their number
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.660]   off of their piece of paper.
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.380]   I entered that into a fresh laptop
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.380]   that I bought from Target.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.900]   And then I put in my other number on my piece of paper,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.660]   added the two numbers together on the computer,
[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.660]   there's the key.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.540]   And at the same time, like just scrambled for two days,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.060]   setting up a new wallet
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.820]   where I could move my ETH to safely,
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.820]   like getting people to be multi-sig partners,
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.980]   just like doing all sorts of like stuff
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.420]   that, you know, 10 years ago,
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.420]   you would expect to just be part of a cyberpunk,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.660]   you know, science fiction novel,
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.020]   but you know, now it's all real.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.140]   - So you're doing this all by yourself, essentially.
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.340]   - Most of it by myself.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.780]   - 'Cause you have to keep it secret.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.580]   - Right, and I needed my family to actually like go
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.220]   and read the number on their piece of paper.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.660]   And then I am in my new multi-sig wallet,
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.140]   like there's other people that are signatories,
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.980]   but you know,
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.980]   I'm obviously not gonna reveal any details beyond that.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.780]   So I did this, right?
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.140]   And I actually managed to like get the private key,
[00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.220]   make the first transaction that would just move
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.700]   all my ETH to the multi-sig wallet, so it's safe.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.780]   And then second transaction,
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.380]   put the private key on my main computer,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.700]   then started, you know,
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.380]   going in and just selling some of the dog tokens
[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.420]   and then just like giving them to these different charities.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.460]   Now, at the time,
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:49.220]   I actually did not even like have any idea
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.580]   of how much you would be able to get, right?
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.180]   'Cause like on paper,
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.820]   the dog tokens are $7 billion,
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.460]   but like in reality, it's a very liquid market, you know,
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.580]   are you gonna crash it by,
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.180]   after you sell 1 million worth,
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.940]   are you gonna crash it after 10 million?
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.980]   Are you gonna,
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.780]   might you actually be able to get like an entire 200 million?
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.860]   I had no idea.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.820]   So I definitely was just over the mindset,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.540]   like, okay, I mean, I'll sell a bit,
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.460]   maybe I get some ETH and then, you know,
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.860]   donated some ETH to give well,
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.020]   donated some to other groups and then, okay,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.020]   have some dog tokens.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.340]   Like I don't have an easy ability to sell more myself,
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.700]   but then I'll just like give them to these groups
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.620]   and like, you know,
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.980]   hopefully they'll do good things with them.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.220]   It was actually,
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.860]   I actually donated a 20% and dumped 80%.
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.420]   Yeah, so the COVID India group got one batch
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.900]   and then there's another group that got another batch.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.340]   And I don't wanna say who they are
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.420]   'cause I think that they wanna announce themselves
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.260]   at some point.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.100]   - Sure.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.180]   - Yeah, but you can see the fact that these transactions
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.780]   were made on the blockchain,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.780]   but it was just very interesting and unexpected
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.780]   and just an insanely crazy situation.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.900]   - It's been a couple of weeks.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.740]   First of all, thank you for helping me hang up some curtains.
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.420]   This is a first for the podcast
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.180]   and shows that you're truly a special person
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.780]   to be willing to help.
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.620]   But now a couple of weeks later,
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.280]   do you regret any aspect of that decision?
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.740]   - I'm sure there is some things
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.660]   that I probably could have done better.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.740]   Like I was actually talking to some of these charities
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.980]   and I was impressed by just how much money they managed
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.900]   to get out of selling some of these coins.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.780]   So I probably could have done better
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.580]   by just like talking more with the traders
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.480]   and actually ensuring that they can do a better job
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.480]   of maximizing the value of all of them.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.340]   But it was a very stressful time
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.700]   and I did have to act quickly.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.300]   Like I did manage to make a lot of the donations
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.260]   before a few days before the great crypto crash happened.
[00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.260]   So it's difficult to like,
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.900]   obviously there's parallel universes in which I did better,
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.220]   but at the same time,
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.460]   there's also lots of parallel universes
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.380]   where because I hesitated more
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.860]   and tried to spend more time thinking,
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.620]   I missed the opportunity.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.540]   So on that, it's like a luck of the draw
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.540]   and I'm just happy that everything was able to turn out
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.340]   as well as it did.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.260]   - But psychologically, you mentioned stress.
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.340]   How hard was it?
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.300]   - It was stressful, right?
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.580]   I think, well, one of the really stressful parts
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.300]   was just the fact that I had to basically move
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.820]   all of my funds, including the 325,000 Ether
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.100]   from one cold wallet into another hot wallet,
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.420]   or sorry, into another multi-sig wallet.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.860]   And maybe the multi-sig wallet had a bug in it.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.780]   Maybe there's like some mistake I'll make in the middle
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.700]   that causes the funds to get lost.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.780]   That part was stressful.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.900]   And I was definitely stressing out for two days.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.540]   I mean, triple checking the new wallet,
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.660]   I even did a bit of an audit of the code myself.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.060]   I wrote my own JavaScript to DAP to make confirmations
[00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.020]   because GnosisSafe didn't work with the status wallet well.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.540]   So there was definitely,
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.620]   that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon.
[00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.740]   I was also kind of definitely a bit worried about,
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.580]   or uncertain, I guess, how the public and,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.980]   including the coin communities
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.540]   would perceive the whole thing.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.420]   But I was actually impressed.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.860]   For every poster that was saying like,
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.940]   no, why did Vitalik rug pull on us?
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.940]   He was, his wallet was supposed to be a burn address.
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.820]   There was like 10 people that were like,
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.140]   oh, I thought I was just in this
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.060]   because it's a fun pyramid gambling thing.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.780]   But instead I ended up being part of this,
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.380]   great public, good thing for humanity.
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.420]   And that's like even more amazing.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   So the amount of that that I got was very impressive.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:07.700]   So all in all, I think the dark people did great.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:08.620]   - The dark people.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.660]   Is there something you can extend
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.120]   to the bigger picture of it,
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.660]   in the principles you apply to making this decision?
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.300]   Is there some principles, philosophies
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.220]   that you apply also to the decisions you make
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.420]   around Ethereum?
[00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:28.540]   - I think a big one for me is just this idea
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.780]   that crypto isn't just an opportunity
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.780]   to give people slightly better ways
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.100]   to save value in all of these things.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.020]   It's also an opportunity to basically create
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.540]   these new digital institutions
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.180]   that could serve the public good in new ways.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.900]   And that's something that I've been interested in
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.740]   for a long time.
[00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.020]   I actually even have this article in Bitcoin Magazine
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.420]   back in 2014, where I basically suggested this idea
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.940]   that you would have coins that represent causes
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.780]   and people would just buy and accept those coins
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.420]   because they support those causes.
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.140]   So I think it's called markets, institutions, and currencies
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.540]   a new form of social incentivization or something like that.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.340]   And I'm sure you can find it and throw it in the links.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.620]   So that was interesting to kind of see becoming real.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.380]   And in general, I think public goods are very important
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:24.700]   and on the internet, public goods
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.460]   are even more important.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.820]   Like every single like Svetlana's podcast
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.460]   is just on YouTube and anyone can go and see it.
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.740]   There's no way for you to sell it
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.740]   and so that some people can see it,
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.020]   but other people can't see it.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.500]   You could do that, but then you'd obviously be
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.860]   reducing your impact.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:47.100]   So thank you for making the amazing Lex Friedman podcast
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.260]   so freely available.
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.940]   - Well, that's actually a tense thing is how do you do it
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.620]   in a way that's not controlled in a centralized fashion?
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.140]   'Cause actually YouTube feels free and open,
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.700]   but it nevertheless is one company
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.980]   making centralized decisions.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.780]   And the first time I realized YouTube was not forever
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.020]   is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience library
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.500]   was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.140]   And it made me realize we need to,
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.940]   it's like the realization that Fiat money is centralized
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:25.780]   is realizing that this is not forever
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.740]   and you might want to come up with schemes
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.500]   to distribute it, to decentralize the control of it
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.660]   in the way that audio for podcasters was just an RSS feed.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.500]   - Exactly.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.100]   And I think one of the kind of philosophical things
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.900]   that I hope to achieve is kind of decouple
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.460]   the concept of public goods, which are incredibly important
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.860]   and are the lifeblood of modern civilization
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.020]   from the idea that there is or can be
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.820]   one central organization that represents the public
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.580]   and perfectly understands and can impose their idea
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.580]   of what is the good.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.380]   When people talk about public goods,
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.460]   it just often comes with this baggage
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.420]   of either centralization or conformism.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.460]   And I think it doesn't have to, right?
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.260]   Like often the most important public goods
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.660]   are the ones that are created by the crazy individualists
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.580]   that disagree with everyone else.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.260]   So trying to make this kind of synthesis
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.740]   where you combine the values of decentralization
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.420]   and the values of open source,
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.100]   but you're not naive about it.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.700]   And you realize that for these things to be produced,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.060]   there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.340]   There needs to be some way of supporting people
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.900]   who are working these projects.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.340]   But at the same time, you want to avoid that turning
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.780]   into a vector of centralization,
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.980]   like trying to sort of get all of the good things
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.900]   without the bad things.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.900]   To me, that's a big part of sort of what my grand experiment
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.060]   in crypto is about.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.980]   And we are doing things in different kinds of things
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.820]   for this, right?
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.620]   Like there's the Gitcoin grants quadratic funding
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.460]   in the Ethereum ecosystem.
[00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.820]   There's obviously these dog coins that just happens,
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.100]   I guess, accidentally.
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.900]   There's other projects that, like for example,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.980]   Uniswap has their Uniswap DAO
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.620]   that just has a huge amount of funding.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.380]   And like, we haven't seen yet
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.620]   how that's going to be deployed,
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.540]   but it could be potentially deployed
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.740]   to do lots of really good and amazing things.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.140]   - Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.740]   to fight for social causes?
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:46.180]   - I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.740]   to fight for definitely some specific things
[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.940]   that are social causes,
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.620]   like just the fact of creating an open financial system
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.940]   that anyone can participate in,
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.300]   no matter where they are in the world,
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.700]   that's a social cause.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.220]   Just giving people the ability to organize
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.220]   and create projects,
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.620]   even if it's five people in five different countries.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.300]   I think that kind of inclusiveness,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.180]   I think that's a social cause
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.340]   and it's a core crypto value.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   But then at the same time,
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.780]   like the other important part of the magic of Ethereum
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.140]   that you have to balance that against
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.860]   is that it is also this open platform
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.940]   where ultimately the things that are on Ethereum
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.460]   is just the things that the community makes of it.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.700]   - Well, you kind of briefly opened the door,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.620]   so let's go there.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.860]   When it comes to government regulation of crypto,
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.220]   what's the best case scenario,
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.500]   what's the worst case scenario?
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.620]   In terms of, as you've kind of mentioned,
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.060]   Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.980]   and how do you see the interplay between governments
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.240]   and this new technology that resists centralized power?
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.100]   Best case and worst case.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.060]   - The best case is that
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.020]   blockchains continue to prosper
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.700]   and we figure out scalability
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.380]   so that people can actually start doing things on block,
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.660]   like all of the amazing use cases
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.820]   that people have been talking about
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.420]   instead of today where a lot of the great stuff
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.100]   gets priced out because transaction fees are at $5 to $10.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.420]   And then we see a lot of different amazing applications
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.780]   happening on blockchains.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.220]   It could be DAOs creating new ways for people
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.900]   to interact and organize with each other,
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.580]   new ways for artists to get funded,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.100]   and just all sorts of these amazing things.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.100]   And there's just enough public support
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.780]   and just enough people that see that,
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.220]   look, crypto is clearly doing a lot of good things.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.660]   And there are definitely areas where there's tensions,
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.380]   but in those areas where there's tensions,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.460]   there could be some kind of creative
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.860]   and interesting approaches that get figured out.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.980]   The concept of corporate taxes, for example,
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.020]   that would disappear as a revenue stream
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.740]   if theoretically corporations just all get replaced by DAOs.
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.180]   But maybe there's some other creative way
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.180]   by which DAOs themselves can have some kind
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.980]   of encoded governance that ensures that they have
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.100]   at least some kind of bias
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.220]   towards serving the global public good.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.620]   And maybe DAOs can do enough of that
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.900]   that people are happy with it.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.060]   And there are going to be things
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.180]   that people are unhappy about.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.380]   There's always going to be the people
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.660]   that wants to surveil everyone.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.660]   But if the kind of effect of crypto
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.260]   from just empowering people is greater than that
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.340]   and greater than that in a way
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.180]   that people can just easily see,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.260]   then that would be a good scenario, right?
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.980]   And we'll just become incorporated
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.460]   and accepted the same way as happened with the internet.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.780]   But the worst case scenario would, of course,
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.860]   be just people suddenly flipping
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.380]   and going into moral panic mode and just,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.460]   oh my God, this technology is used by,
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.140]   insert bad group of the day.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.740]   And then I don't think governments have the ability
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.220]   to ban crypto to the extent of just completely
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.300]   preventing blockchains from existing,
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.700]   but they definitely have the ability
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.420]   to really marginalize it, right?
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.260]   Like if you just ban all exchanges
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.340]   and ban all links from the fiat ecosystem to crypto,
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.380]   and you ban all the kind of mainstream employers
[00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency,
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.620]   then you can successfully turn it into
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.900]   a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.540]   that has much less impact than otherwise would.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.820]   So it's somewhere between the good scenario
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.660]   and the bad scenario.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.420]   I'm obviously hoping for the good.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.460]   - Well, that's interesting also,
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:17.580]   the tension between governments and companies.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.260]   Like if you have a bunch of billionaires
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.060]   or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.620]   and then governments resisting that,
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.700]   it's interesting who wins out in that worst case scenario.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.300]   And then almost when companies
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.500]   and rich quote unquote respectable people
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.460]   embrace cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, so on,
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.260]   even the dog coins, it almost sends a signal
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.940]   to everybody else that this is a revolution
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.020]   and it's here to stay.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.540]   On this one little tangent that you brought up,
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.820]   this is almost an outdated idea, but it's still with us,
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.700]   which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity,
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.000]   for drugs, for crime, and so on.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.820]   Is there some sense that worries you
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.820]   that if cryptocurrency, if Ethereum runs the world,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:16.340]   then crime, making money from crime will be easier?
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.060]   - There's always that possibility,
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.900]   but at the same time, I think if you look at
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.660]   the world as a whole and the way
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.380]   all the other technological trends are going,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.980]   in-person surveillance is just going up every year.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.260]   If you commit a crime in meat space,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.700]   it's getting harder and harder to get away with it.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.140]   So if you want to do something,
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.580]   and this is something that's just happening
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.100]   as a result of just better technology
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.380]   and information transparency,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.100]   a lot of it's hard to prevent, even if you really tried.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.100]   So the world where things go dark to such an extent,
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.580]   as the police hawks sometimes like to say,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.300]   to such an extent that, "Oh my God,
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.260]   "the criminals are committing crimes with impunity
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.820]   "and we can't see anything," that just seems unlikely.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.820]   But on the other hand, the world where there just
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.220]   is no privacy, for example,
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:24.220]   or the world where there just is no ability
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.980]   to act outside of the confines of mainstream institutions,
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.860]   that's something that's more realistic.
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.940]   And that seems like something that could lead
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.780]   to a lot of scary things.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.620]   And even from a government's point of view,
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.220]   governments over the last few years,
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.060]   a lot of them, they're very worried about sovereignty.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:52.980]   They're worried about if their country's economy
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.900]   is in social environments, they're just completely dependent
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.740]   on basically foreign tech companies
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.580]   controlled by foreign governments.
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.580]   Governments are not on team government.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:05.620]   Indian government is on team India,
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.340]   the Russian government is on team Russia and so forth.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.620]   They don't want the US to be able
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.980]   to have this big backdoor into everything.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.980]   So I do think that a balance is needed,
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.980]   but at the same time, I do think,
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:29.940]   I guess I definitely worry more about the possibility
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:36.620]   that just without things like crypto,
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.860]   kind of acting outside of institutions becomes too impossible
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.660]   and I don't even necessarily mean outside of governments,
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.380]   even just outside of corporations,
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.580]   becomes too impossible and there's just terrible things
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:47.660]   that come as a result.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.020]   If things going in the other direction,
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:55.260]   it obviously is a risk, but at the same time,
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.140]   I think in the long term, a crypto can potentially
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.460]   even offer defenses as much as attacks
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.420]   against that sort of thing.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.460]   - Yeah, throughout history,
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.300]   many of the most destructive things came
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.820]   from centralized institutions
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.100]   versus sort of from the people operating in the shadows.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.740]   And I've been talking to a bunch of psychedelics folks,
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.900]   the people doing researches like Greg Doblin
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.700]   in Johns Hopkins, there's a lot of exciting research
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.540]   on psychedelics and one thing you could say
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.460]   about operating at the edge of legality,
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   it could actually accelerate the adoption
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.500]   of particular things like whether it's marijuana
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.260]   or psychedelics that can help people out,
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:41.460]   it almost accelerates the policy.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.380]   It forces the policy to catch up
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.860]   to where the people stand.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.220]   So there's a positive way of doing things
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.500]   that are in the gray area of legality
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.580]   and creating a market that allows people
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.580]   to in a safe way be able to participate
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.140]   in this gray area of legality.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.700]   - The other thing to keep in mind, of course,
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   is that the set of the kinds of things
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.980]   that just like payment processors as companies
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.820]   try to restrict people you from
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.980]   is much larger than the set of things that's illegal.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.460]   Part of that is because they wanna be super conservative
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.820]   and the more layers you have,
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.540]   the more they're conservative because they're scared
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.080]   of what the layer below them will do to them.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.540]   Sometimes they have their own moral opinions
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.180]   of various kinds.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.580]   They go after lots of people.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.900]   They make life really hard for sex workers, for example,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.300]   psychedelics, as you mentioned.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   There's a lot of activity even including
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.060]   stuff that is totally legal.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.700]   There's this shadow like PayPal, credit card governments
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.100]   or whatever you wanna call it.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.340]   (mumbles)
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.980]   That makes it just hard to participate in this stuff.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.380]   So I think reducing the number of intermediaries
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:54.740]   is definitely normally a good thing.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.060]   - All right, let's talk about one of the most exciting
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.100]   technologies, technically, philosophically,
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.100]   socially, financially, in every way,
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.180]   which is Ethereum 2.0.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.500]   There's a million things to talk about,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.060]   but step one is probably a good thing to do,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.660]   which is can you briefly summarize your vision
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.060]   how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum more scalable,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.340]   secure, and sustainable?
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.380]   - Sure.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.460]   So I think recently we've actually been kind of de-emphasizing
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.700]   the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.300]   So the reason behind that was that originally we envisioned
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.100]   something more like a big grand event
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.900]   where all the good things would happen at the same time.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.860]   It would be a new blockchain,
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.140]   and it would be a new protocol,
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.260]   and people would have to take a lot of effort
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:46.460]   to migrate over.
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.660]   But later we've slowly changed the roadmap over
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.220]   to something that's much more incremental.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.060]   So proof of stake happens kind of over time,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.540]   and then sharding gets added over time,
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.340]   and all these features get added over time.
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.660]   And so the experience for just a regular Ethereum user
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.500]   still feels very seamless.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.340]   It's maybe a little bit more complex than the hard forks
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.740]   that we've already done from a user's point of view,
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.100]   but not by that much.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.860]   So the big two things that are happening,
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.820]   these are what used to be considered
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   the two flagship features of ETH 2.0,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.940]   and now they're just the flagship features
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.740]   of the next evolution of Ethereum,
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.300]   as proof of stake and sharding.
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.140]   So proof of stake is a consensus algorithm,
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.540]   it's a, or a consensus mechanism, I should say.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.340]   It's, the difference is that like an algorithm
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.780]   is something that you run by yourself,
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:45.460]   a mechanism is like, it involves interactions between people,
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.100]   and it could even include incentives and all of that.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.060]   So a consensus mechanism,
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:56.220]   so by which nodes in the network agree on,
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.500]   you know, which blocks came in,
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.740]   which transactions came in, in what order,
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.020]   to make sure that once a block gets accepted,
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.940]   it can't get reverted,
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.340]   and all of these things that we expect from a blockchain.
[00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.980]   So existing blockchains, including Bitcoin,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.460]   including the Ethereum of today,
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.660]   and including a lot of them,
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:13.660]   they use proof of work, right?
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.020]   So the reason why we need proof of anything
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.140]   is because like, they serve this function
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.540]   that I call an economic civil resistance.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.740]   So that's obviously a big word for,
[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.980]   especially if you've never heard of civils before,
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.540]   but like the basic idea is, right,
[00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.580]   that you have a network and you have lots of computers
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.860]   that agree on like which block to accept.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:38.180]   And sometimes you get, you know,
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.020]   two blocks that get published at the same time,
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.420]   and you just have to agree on an order.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:44.220]   So there has to be some kind of voting game.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.460]   But then the question is, well, in this voting game,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.380]   you know, who gets to vote, who gets to participate?
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.140]   Now, you can't say one person, one vote, right?
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.100]   The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.060]   is because you need some kind of like authority
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.780]   or some kind of mechanism to say, you know,
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.900]   who the humans are.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.940]   And if you don't have that,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.900]   then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.980]   or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.100]   that have 10 billion, you know, virtual nodes.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.860]   And then just like say, look, I'm 99% of the network.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.780]   I should control everything.
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.900]   So to prevent this, what proof of work
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.260]   and proof of stake both do is they basically say,
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.180]   well, the weight of your vote,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:27.540]   like how much influence your votes have in the consensus
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.980]   is proportional to like what quantity
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.780]   of economic resources you bring in.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.380]   So in the case of proof of work,
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.300]   you prove what economic resources you have
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.580]   because your economic resources are computers
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.420]   and you prove that you have them by just running them 24/7
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.740]   using these hash algorithms, right?
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.020]   So this does solve the problem, right?
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.300]   Because in order to attack the network,
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.180]   you have to come in with more computers
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.460]   or more money invested into computers and electricity
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.660]   than the rest of the network put together.
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.540]   And that's extremely expensive.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.620]   In proof of stake, instead of relying on people
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.220]   with computers that are just constantly cranking out
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   hashes 24/7, as you're like a unit of economic resources,
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.860]   you just use like holdings of coins inside the system, right?
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.940]   So all of these blockchains,
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.660]   they have some kind of coin in them.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.340]   Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has Ether,
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.460]   you know, they all have a coin.
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.140]   So why not just use that as the economic resource
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.020]   that you're using to measure participation?
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.380]   So that's like the core distinction
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.060]   between proof of work and proof of stake.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.140]   I like proof of stake
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.580]   and I've liked proof of stake for many years,
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.460]   basically because like it just requires
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   much less ongoing resource consumption, right?
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.660]   Like with proof of work,
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.060]   I mean, we have to like actually go
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.860]   and buy these physical computers.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.100]   And these days, you know,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.340]   they have specialized hardware,
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.140]   ASICs, application specific integrated circuits.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.300]   You have to go produce them, you have to go buy them.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.620]   And unless you have millions of dollars,
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.660]   you know, you have to buy them
[00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.740]   from one of these other people who creates them.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.500]   And those other people often end up
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.860]   taking a huge cut of the profits themselves.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.020]   And then, you know, you have to plug them in,
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.980]   you have to just burn all of this electricity
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.020]   that's just running 24/7.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.500]   So it consumes a huge amount of energy, right?
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.140]   And it can add not just energy,
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.220]   it also, you know, just to create the hardware, right?
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.820]   Like people focus a lot on energy,
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.100]   but like actually about half the cost
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.580]   of proof of work mining is the cost of the hardware.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.260]   So hardware is a very big deal too.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.380]   And you know, you need this like,
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.180]   this really big and powerful,
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.500]   like very specialized hardware,
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.820]   I know the kind that fills up these big warehouses.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820]   So proof of stake,
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.180]   you don't really need that much electricity.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.740]   You just need just a little bit
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.180]   to run a regular computer.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.060]   You can run proof of stake validators
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.420]   on computers that you already have.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:52.300]   So it's just much less resource intensive.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.100]   And like, this is good for a few reasons, right?
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.220]   Like one is, you know,
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.380]   the kind of environmental rationale that,
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.700]   you know, you're not breaking the environment.
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:04.060]   The second is that you're not taking away electricity
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.260]   and like other resources from other people.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.060]   I mean, like right now there's,
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.820]   I think just today I saw a story about like Iran
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.780]   wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.420]   because it was just grabbing up so much electricity
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.500]   that it was, you know, outbidding the nearby towns
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.980]   and they just didn't have enough.
[00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:22.340]   And then there was like Chia,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.940]   the one that's doing proof of like hard disk mining,
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.220]   basically it's just like grabbing up so many hard disks
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.140]   that there's a shortage, right?
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.140]   So that's the second reason.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.420]   And then the third more selfish reason
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.860]   is that because participating in consensus
[00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.820]   does not require so much energy expenditure,
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.900]   you don't need to pay people as much to participate, right?
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.340]   So like Bitcoin and Ethereum,
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.580]   they both issue somewhere around 4%
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.660]   of the total supply every year right now to miners.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.060]   So Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.700]   and the current supply is about 115 million.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:54.700]   But with proof of stake,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.620]   like we expect it'll be somewhere between 500,000
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.460]   and one million per year.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.140]   So that means, you know,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.100]   the supply doesn't have to increase so quickly.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.940]   So-
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.620]   - One of the pros that people sort of argue
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.820]   for the proof of work is that it is secure
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.820]   because it's much more difficult to sort of,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.980]   as you've highlighted, it's difficult to participate.
[00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.980]   Is there, what are your thoughts about the security
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.980]   of the proof of stake mechanism?
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.700]   Is there ways to make it secure?
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.660]   - So I think proof of stake is very secure
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.540]   because in order to be able to attack the system,
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.300]   you need to have like basically as much stake
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.300]   as the rest of the network, right?
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.140]   So that means like right now, for example,
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.660]   we have 5 million ETH staking.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.300]   So you have to come up with 5 million ETH
[00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.660]   and then join the network.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:52.020]   And then the other, so 5 million ETH is a lot, right?
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.740]   It's like, how much is it now?
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.260]   Like $15 billion.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.300]   So that's actually more than I believe the cost
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.460]   of attacking the Bitcoin network.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.060]   And then the second thing is that recovering
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.020]   from attacks is much easier in proof of stake
[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:05.980]   than in proof of work, right?
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.980]   Because in proof of stake, you have, like, first of all,
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.660]   we have for many kinds of attacks
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.100]   that you do against this network.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.620]   We have this concept of like automatic slashing, right?
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.460]   Which basically means that in order to like revert
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.820]   a finalized block, so if there's one block that's like
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.940]   accepted by the network and you try to convince the network
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.940]   to kind of revert that block and accept a different block,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.820]   in order to make that kind of attack,
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.940]   you basically have to have your validator,
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.580]   like a big portion of your validators,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.940]   sign two conflicting messages.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.980]   And this is something that like,
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.940]   once these messages are on the network,
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.300]   you can go and prove, like, look, these people did it.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.820]   And so we have this feature in the protocol called slashing
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.700]   where you basically take all these people
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.620]   who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins, right?
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.660]   And you don't burn anyone else's coins.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.540]   Now, there are other cases, like for example,
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.380]   if instead of reverting blocks,
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.620]   the attack just tries to censor everyone, right?
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.300]   Then what you do, everyone who got censored
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.860]   would just like basically create the minority chain.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.420]   And then the community would basically have
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.380]   to do a soft fork, right?
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.380]   They would just have to say like,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.020]   "Look, this chain is clearly attacking us.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.740]   This chain is the one not attacking us.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.340]   And so we're going to join this chain."
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.100]   And then what happens is that on that new chain,
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.500]   the attackers also lose a lot of coins, right?
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.620]   So the difference between proof of stake and proof of work
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.180]   is that in a proof of stake system,
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:24.620]   like you can identify specific participants
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.500]   and you can say, you know, these,
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.940]   and like, this isn't like, you know,
[00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.060]   a human going in and saying,
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.500]   "I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you."
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.260]   This is like automated, right?
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.100]   You can go-
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.620]   - So the slashing process is automated.
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.460]   - Yes.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.460]   - Is there ways it can go wrong?
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.220]   So that's a painful process where the coins are burned.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.580]   - It is painful, yes.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.980]   I think, I mean, the one big unknown, of course,
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.580]   is like if an attack actually happens
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:51.380]   and like if an attack happens that requires the community
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.860]   to actually choose one of these minority forks,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.180]   then like what would the community
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.020]   actually successfully coordinating on this look like, right?
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.220]   Like it's like, you know, we can talk about it
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.940]   and we can, you know, write like science fiction novels
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.900]   about it, but like until it's happened,
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.180]   you don't really know the details
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.020]   of like what it looks like and how difficult it is.
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:13.540]   - What are the channels of communication for the community?
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.660]   If you can enlighten me a little bit, like what,
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.980]   you know, in many ways in the political realm,
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.340]   Twitter is often used as a way to kind of
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.420]   have these emerging phenomena of large groups of people
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.300]   coming to a consensus about a particular idea.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.380]   And then there's battle for consensus.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:35.140]   What's in the Ethereum community, how do people,
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:39.420]   what are the sources of natural language-based communication
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.000]   that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.380]   Or is it all through money?
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.140]   Is it all through trading that the communication happens?
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.140]   - There's definitely talking as well.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.940]   I mean, like we have to agree
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.660]   on protocol changes somehow, right?
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.060]   Like there's Twitter, there's Reddit, there's GitHub,
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.540]   there's all of the various Ethereum forums,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.820]   Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.060]   There's just in-person communication.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.900]   Then there's just kind of like the hidden web
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.260]   of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal.
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:14.040]   So it's like some of everything, right?
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.320]   But I think like the thing to emphasize around,
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.700]   like can you actually come to consensus on, you know,
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.540]   whether or not to fork the chain
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:23.540]   because the attacker is censoring everyone,
[00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.900]   just for example, is like,
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.860]   everyone who's running a node
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.420]   is going to see almost the same thing, right?
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.480]   Like they're gonna be off by a few seconds
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.180]   and like maybe they'll be off by a few minutes,
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.500]   they'll disagree by a few minutes.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.720]   But like, if it's a serious attack, you know,
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.820]   people are gonna know, right?
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.940]   It's not like one of those things where, you know,
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.940]   oh, we're trying to agree on like, I don't know,
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.140]   did Epstein kill himself or like some random political fact
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.100]   where like in reality, no one knows a single thing
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.400]   about what's actually going on
[00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.620]   and they're all speculating.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.380]   Like it is much more visible, right?
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.340]   So we do have that, but you know, at the same time,
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.220]   I'm happy to admit that like,
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.120]   these are fairly untested mechanisms,
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.380]   but like at the same time,
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.860]   they're also untested mechanisms in proof of work, right?
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.500]   And like in proof of work, it's even harder
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.920]   because in proof of work,
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.580]   you don't have the ability to like identify and say,
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.380]   like, you know, I'm going to, these miners attacked
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.220]   and so we're not gonna let these miners in,
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:20.260]   these miners not attack, so we're gonna keep them in.
[00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:21.540]   Like you have to pretty much, you know,
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.760]   either take out none of the miners
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.500]   or you do a fork that changes their proof of work algorithm,
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.060]   which takes out all of the miners, right?
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:32.180]   So the economics of like recovering from attacks
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.580]   in proof of work, at least to me,
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.980]   actually do seem like more unfavorable,
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.740]   but you know, I'm sure the proof of work people you talk to
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.500]   will give a very different and contradictory opinions
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.640]   and that's totally fine and amazing.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.100]   - Some people describe MEV,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:51.720]   minor extractable value as an existential risk to Ethereum.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.860]   What is MEV?
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.020]   How important is it to solve MEV?
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.180]   If it's important, what ideas do you have?
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.780]   - Sure, how about after this one,
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.940]   we'll also talk about sharding,
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.620]   'cause it's amazing and it's part of-
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:03.660]   - We'll return back to sharding,
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:06.060]   which is, we'll return to the big picture
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.980]   of the scaling problem, as you mentioned.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.740]   - I love this conversation, you know,
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.700]   depth first search instead of breadth first.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   So basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value,
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.180]   it is not different in proof of work and proof of stake,
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.140]   right, so like if you want to call it, you know,
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.900]   block proposal extractable value,
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.340]   like it sounds a lot sexy, but you know,
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.420]   we can call it BPEV instead of MEV, who cares?
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.220]   But the basic- - So this is a problem
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.020]   in both proof of work and proof of stake.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.460]   - Yes, so the basic idea is that
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.260]   if you have the ability to choose
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.580]   which transactions go into a block and in what order,
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.020]   then you have the ability to like take advantage
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.900]   of that position for economic gain
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.700]   in a lot more ways than just collecting
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.060]   transaction fees, right?
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   Like for example, there's decentralized exchanges
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.980]   on chain like Uniswap.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.820]   And like, let's say the price of ETH versus USDC
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.940]   was 2,700 the previous block,
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.460]   but then there was a bit of a market drop
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.940]   and now it's 2,680, where you can go on Uniswap
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.020]   and you can just like gobble up the entire part of,
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.900]   you know, the automated order book
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.460]   that's like between 2,700 and 2,680, right?
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.660]   And that's, and then at the same time,
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.820]   you like run a bot and you know,
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.460]   you buy some ETH back at 2,680
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.740]   and you've just like made about $10 of profit, right?
[00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.100]   So, or well, $10 times, you know,
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.300]   whatever the depth is, right?
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.500]   So, and so there's lots of little things like that.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.540]   There's also things that involve like front running
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.220]   other people's transactions.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.980]   So one example of this would be that
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.860]   if someone sends a transaction that says,
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.260]   like, I don't know, buy me five ETH
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.700]   for whatever price that you can get,
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.420]   then, but with a maximum of, let's say,
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.100]   yeah, $15,000, then you can go and like,
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.420]   you can send each, put a transaction
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.820]   right in front of that transaction
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.580]   and you can like buy up that ETH first
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.100]   and then you resell it to him at, you know,
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.900]   $15,000 minus one.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.340]   So there's-
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.860]   - And then you get to make a little bit of money that way.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.700]   - Exactly.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.380]   So there's a lot of these different like arbitrage,
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.500]   front running, back running, these different tricks
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.100]   that allow block proposers to-
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.540]   - To get some percentage on top, like overhead.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.380]   - Exactly.
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.220]   - Okay.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.460]   - And the reason why this is a challenge
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.660]   is because it's, like, first of all,
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.340]   it sometimes degrades user experience
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.460]   because users get in a less favorable trades,
[00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.580]   but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.940]   for applications, sometimes it's not that bad.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.860]   But like the bigger risk that I think
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.660]   some people consider more existential
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.180]   is that there's just much more economies of scale
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.020]   in figuring out how to extract all this revenue, right?
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.220]   Because if you're just collecting transaction fees,
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.420]   there aren't really economies of scale,
[00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.300]   there aren't really benefits to centralizing, right?
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.620]   Because it's a very simple formula.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.060]   You just like grab up the transactions
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.380]   that pay you the most.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.820]   But with MEV, there's all these sophisticated algorithms.
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.980]   And if you have lots of money,
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.420]   then you can hire really smart people
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.660]   to make amazing algorithms.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.660]   And then you can use the other half of your money
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.820]   to get a lot of mining power or a lot of stake.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.180]   And you get a lot of opportunities
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.980]   to use your even better algorithms.
[00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.540]   So there's this risk that like as a result of this,
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.620]   mining is basically, or even validating proof of stake
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:19.820]   is going to centralize.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.860]   So I think the ecosystem's best reply to this sort of risk,
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.820]   and it's the direction where projects like Flashbots
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.900]   are going already, is if you can't eliminate
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.300]   the centralization, then you try to firewall it, right?
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.100]   And the way that you firewall it is you basically say,
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.060]   we're going to try to deliberately create a marketplace
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.380]   where people can just do the complicated work
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.140]   of creating what are called bundles,
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.900]   like bundles of transactions that are very profitable.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.260]   And then at the other side of the market,
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.660]   you just have like block proposes reminders
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.820]   that are just dumb notes.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.860]   And they go and ask the, what are called searchers,
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.860]   the bundle creators.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.620]   And they just ask like, hey, how much can you give me
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.580]   if I put in your bundle?
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.740]   And then they just take the highest offer.
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.380]   So you sort of separate out the task
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.420]   and you have the easy part,
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.660]   and then you have the hard part,
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.580]   and you have like this special class of actor
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.180]   called a searcher that does the hard part.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.420]   And then the easy part, the people doing the easy part,
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:20.740]   which is just miners and validators,
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.540]   they kind of just talk to all the different people
[00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.180]   doing the searching and they just, you know,
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.740]   accept the highest bidder, right?
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:32.060]   So, and this is also just like interesting,
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.980]   an interesting example of like economic design philosophy,
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.820]   right?
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.300]   Like sometimes you can't just like make centralization
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.860]   go away, sometimes it's inevitable,
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.180]   but at least you can try to kind of contain it,
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:47.340]   you can direct it, or you can even sort of firewall it away
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:49.300]   from core consensus,
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:51.580]   the parts that really do need to be decentralized.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.740]   - But you don't see it as an existential risk.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.300]   It's just a bit of a problem
[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.940]   that has to be constantly dealt with.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.380]   - It's a risk.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.420]   Like there's obviously a risk that, you know,
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.060]   it's a very severe problem,
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.020]   and that even this flashbots approach
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.140]   has some fatal flaw or whatever.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.980]   But I'm definitely,
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:13.020]   we're definitely approaching it with the mindset of,
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.900]   you know, this is a problem and like, yes,
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.460]   we do have to do some work to solve it,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.300]   but we're doing it.
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.260]   And so far it's being solved.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:22.420]   - Okay, let's talk about the other really,
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.740]   really fascinating part of the future of Ethereum.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.940]   Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0,
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.500]   but the future of Ethereum
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.620]   that also may require a hard fork.
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.980]   I don't know, you can correct me on this.
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.700]   Is, well, broadly, ideas for scaling?
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.540]   - Yes.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:44.020]   - And more specifically sort of layer two
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:48.500]   or layer one and two intersection ideas
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.060]   of how to achieve scaling.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:52.700]   And at the core of that is the idea of sharding.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.260]   So first, what is sharding?
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.740]   - Okay.
[00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:00.860]   So there's two major paradigms for scaling blockchains,
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.060]   right, as you said, layer one and layer two.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   And layer one basically means make the blockchain itself,
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.900]   like capable of processing more transactions
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.500]   by having, you know, some mechanism
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.660]   by which you can do that,
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.620]   despite the fact that there's a limit
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.100]   to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.140]   And then layer two says,
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.340]   well, we're going to keep the blockchain as is,
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.860]   but we're going to create clever protocols
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.540]   that sit on top of the blockchain
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.940]   that still use the blockchain
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.740]   and then still kind of inherit things
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.060]   like the security guarantees of a blockchain.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.220]   But at the same time,
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.780]   a lot of things are done off chain.
[00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.620]   And so you get more scalability that way.
[00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.660]   So in Ethereum, the most popular paradigm
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.900]   for layer two is rollups
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.220]   and the most popular paradigm for layer one is sharding.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.220]   - So one way to achieve layer one scaling
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.060]   is to increase the block size.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:48.900]   - Yes.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.820]   - Hence the block size wars, quote unquote.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.140]   And you actually tweeted something about,
[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:58.540]   people are saying that Vitalik changed his mind about,
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.260]   he went from being a small blocker to-
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.500]   - No, I went from being big to small.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.980]   - Is it big to small?
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.300]   And, but you said I've been a medium blocker all along.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.740]   So maybe you can also comment on where,
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.540]   on the very basic aspect,
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:14.820]   before we even get to sharding,
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.380]   of where you stand on this block size debate.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.220]   - Sure.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.100]   So the way that I think about the trade-off
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.580]   is I think about it as a trade-off
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.180]   between making it easy to write to the blockchain
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.420]   and making it easy to read the blockchain.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.500]   So when I say read, I just mean,
[00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.180]   have a node and actually verify it
[00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.380]   and make sure that it's correct and all of those things.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.700]   And then by write, I mean send transactions.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.220]   So I think for decentralization,
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.220]   it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.020]   And I think that they're like about equally important.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.140]   If you have a chain that's too expensive to read,
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.820]   then everyone will just trust a few people
[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.340]   to read for them.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.900]   And then those people can change the rules
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.660]   without anyone else's permission.
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.340]   But if on the other hand,
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.180]   it becomes really expensive to write,
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.820]   then everyone will move on to,
[00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.900]   basically, second layer systems
[00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.660]   that are incredibly centralized.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.660]   And that takes away from decentralization
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:06.380]   and self-sovereignty as well.
[00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.260]   So this has been my viewpoint
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.420]   pretty much the whole time.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.020]   It's that you need this balance
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.780]   and going in one direction or the other direction
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.340]   is very unhealthy.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.620]   In the Bitcoin case,
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:19.740]   basically what happens was that Bitcoin originally,
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.100]   at the very beginning, it didn't really have a block size.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.060]   It just had an accidental block size of 32,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:27.220]   or a block size limit of 32 megabytes
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.340]   because that just happens to be the limit
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.380]   of the peer-to-peer messages.
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.220]   But then- - Interesting.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.580]   I didn't even know that part.
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.820]   - Yeah, but then Satoshi back in 2010
[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.780]   was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:39.900]   would be too hard to process.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.580]   So he put the limit down to one megabyte.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.820]   And I think the-
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:47.220]   - By put, you mean sneaked in there.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.900]   - Yeah, just like made an update to the Bitcoin software
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.380]   that made blocks bigger than one,
[00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.220]   I think it's a million bytes invalid.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.380]   And I think the impression that most people had at the time
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.340]   is that this is just a temporary safety measure.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:05.860]   And over time, as we become more confident in the software,
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.340]   that limit would be raised somewhat.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:15.700]   But then when the actual usage of the blockchain
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.380]   started going up,
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.140]   and then it started going up first to 100 kilobytes per block
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.580]   then to 250 kilobytes per block,
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:25.020]   then to 500 kilobytes per block,
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.780]   there started a kind of coming out of the woodworks,
[00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:28.780]   this opinion that like,
[00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.460]   no, that limit should just not be increased.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:36.220]   And then there are all of these attempts at compromising.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.940]   First, there was like a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks.
[00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:43.100]   Then there was the 248 proposal,
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.860]   which is a bit ironic
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.220]   because the 248 proposal started off being
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:49.460]   like a small block negotiating position.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.100]   But then when the big block people came back and said like,
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:53.660]   hey, aren't we going to do this?
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:54.540]   They're like, no, no, no,
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.940]   we don't want the block size increases anymore.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:01.540]   So, there were these two different positions, right?
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.620]   The small blockers,
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.060]   I think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.340]   One is that they just like really, really believe
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.940]   in the importance of being able to read the chain.
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.340]   But two is that a lot of them really believe
[00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.540]   in maintaining this norm of never hard forking, right?
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:21.140]   So, the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.260]   is basically that in a soft fork,
[00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.260]   blocks that were,
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.180]   any block that's valid under the new rules
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.980]   was still valid under the old rules.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.100]   So, if you have a client
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.940]   that verifies according to the old rules,
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.380]   then you'll still be able to accept the chain
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.260]   that follows the new rules.
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.420]   Whereas with a hard fork,
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.700]   like you have to update your code
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.180]   in order to stay on the chain.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:46.980]   And look, they have this belief that,
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.940]   you know, soft forks are kind of
[00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:50.940]   either less coercive than hard forks,
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.340]   which by the way, I completely disagree with.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.220]   I actually think soft forks are more coercive
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.660]   because like basically they force everyone who disagrees
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.220]   to sort of go along by default.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:05.420]   But, or they have this opinion that there's like,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.660]   it's more difficult to abuse soft forks
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.980]   to do really mean things like,
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.500]   or that like completely violate people's expectations
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.940]   like increasing the supply,
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.180]   which is like, you know,
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:18.780]   I think there is some truth to that.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.540]   So, because of, you know, these reasons,
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:22.420]   they just say, we're only going to do soft forks
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.460]   and we want to just not do any hard forks.
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.860]   And they eventually discovered this idea
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:28.940]   called segregated witness
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:31.860]   that allows for like a very tiny block size increase
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.820]   to like the equivalent of about two megabytes
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.140]   with a soft fork.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.140]   It's just a really like weird and devious trick.
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.780]   Like basically what they do is,
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.180]   they take the signatures of transactions
[00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.260]   and then they put them outside of the block.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.820]   And then they add an extra rule that says that like,
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.340]   every, for a block to be valid,
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.380]   the block has to come with a separate,
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.980]   like basically extension block
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.820]   that contains all of the transaction signatures, right?
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.060]   So, you know, when you measure it
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.300]   according to the old rules, like,
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.820]   you know, hey, it adds up to less than a million,
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:04.460]   but actually there's this extension block
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.940]   that the old protocol doesn't even know about.
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:07.780]   So-
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.860]   - It's a hack that seemed to work to,
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.860]   in a small way extend the size of the blocks.
[00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:14.580]   - But so, you know, the small block side was like happy
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:16.140]   with these very low levels of block size.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.140]   And then the big block side wanted to expand to,
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.100]   you know, at the very least go to four megabytes,
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.300]   then, you know, maybe go maybe eight, 20.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.500]   There's disagreements within there as well.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.980]   I definitely was favoring the big side
[00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:33.620]   the whole way through, as you can probably tell.
[00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.460]   But-
[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.940]   - Even though, so the argument against the big
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.900]   is that it makes things more centralized.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.100]   - Yes, because fewer people can run a node
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:44.260]   that verifies the chain.
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.180]   And also because any of these things
[00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.020]   would require a hard fork and, you know,
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.340]   hard forks are inherently risky.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:51.820]   - Do you think there's truth to that?
[00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:52.780]   - I'm pro hard fork.
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:56.300]   I think hard forks are actually like in a, you know,
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.260]   political economic sense, they're better than soft forks.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.740]   - Well, let's, okay, okay.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.020]   I think that's a beautiful principle as stated
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:10.020]   that soft forks may be more coercive than hard forks.
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.020]   This is not just about cryptocurrency.
[00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:16.260]   This is about politics and life.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.100]   That's fascinating.
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.300]   So you're okay with hard forks.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.460]   In fact, you think hard forks is the right way
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.340]   to make changes because then everybody's forced
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.540]   to make a decision.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.380]   - Right.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.200]   - Do you accept this change or not,
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.460]   as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.820]   and the decision's forced on you?
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.140]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.900]   - Okay, so, but, you know, hard forks,
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.740]   some people say, this is when they talk about
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.380]   sort of Ethereum, is there's some aspect
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.860]   to a hard fork where you're trying to upgrade,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.900]   what is it, airplane while it's flying.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:52.420]   - I think soft forks are also upgrading
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.540]   an airplane while it's flying.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.940]   - But it's a smaller upgrade.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.660]   - That's, there's some truth to that.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:02.580]   Like there's definitely a bit more risk
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.140]   of like a split as a result of a hard fork
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.180]   than as a result of a soft fork.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.620]   - And the split is highly undesirable, right?
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.460]   - Well, it depends.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.180]   Like if it's a split because of a bug,
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.140]   then that's horrible.
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.660]   If it's a split as a result of political differences,
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:19.420]   then I think like a split is better than,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.860]   you know, one side being forced to basically
[00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.700]   just like suck it up and accept the majority position,
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.060]   even if it really hates it.
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.800]   - Well, there's also political connections
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.420]   throughout the history of the United States.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:33.100]   It's like sometimes groups of people
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.700]   that strongly disagree with each other
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.860]   should be forced to work it out,
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:40.860]   even if they, even when a split seems
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.700]   like an easy thing in the short term.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.540]   - It depends.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.020]   And I think like, well, for blockchains in particular,
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:50.100]   the costs of people being able to like peacefully do their,
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.300]   go off and do their own thing are much lower, right?
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.260]   Like, you know, okay, if you have a country
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.460]   and you have two groups, then like often enough,
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.780]   like fighting out the new rules requires,
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.380]   like, you know, a civil war requires everyone
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:03.220]   to move and so forth.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.060]   But no, on a blockchain, like, you know,
[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.760]   the costs are lower and so.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.940]   - So if you were to look at the way things worked out
[00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:13.040]   with the block size wars, and there was a split,
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.420]   what is it, Bitcoin Cash?
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:16.260]   - And Bitcoin.
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:17.100]   - Yeah.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.700]   Which, like you looking, putting on your historian hat,
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.020]   you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.500]   So if Dan Carlin were to do an episode
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:29.660]   on the block size wars,
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.020]   do you think it could have turned out better?
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.140]   Do you, are you okay with the way it turned out?
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:40.860]   - I'm definitely disappointed with what happens
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.100]   with the block, with the big block side.
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.900]   I think the source of my disappointment is that like,
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.260]   one of the things that you notice when just looking at like
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.500]   this political disagreements generally,
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.380]   especially when you have environments where, you know,
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.860]   they're authoritarian or like single party dominated,
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:00.240]   and then there's some opposition party,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.380]   and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.660]   but at the same time, the thing you notice is that often
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.180]   enough, the opposition just sucks, right?
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.220]   Like it just doesn't have, you know, political capacity.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.320]   It doesn't have like the ability to come up with policy
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.740]   because it's entire culture is like designed around
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.980]   resisting much more, and then it's designed around like,
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.260]   you know, actually debating serious policy trade-offs.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.220]   And I worry, or I guess not so much worry
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.300]   because it's already happened.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.140]   I unfortunately think that Bitcoin Cash ended up being
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.060]   a victim of this, right?
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.140]   Like first, there was a split with Bitcoin Cash.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.740]   And then of course, Craig Wright came in and you know,
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.020]   Craig Wright was this basically scammer who just keeps on
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.300]   pretending that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.060]   the inventor of Bitcoin.
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:49.980]   Hey, Craig Wright's legal team, do you hear me?
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:53.260]   Yes, I still think your client is a scammer, so sue me.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.140]   - This is definitely gonna be deaf first, sir,
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:57.060]   'cause I gotta ask you about Craig.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.780]   'Cause these people have been contacting me
[00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.220]   and I'm trying to figure out like
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.500]   what is up with this human being.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.440]   So for people who don't know, there's somebody who is,
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.140]   (both laughing)
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.020]   let's start, there's Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.700]   who is the creator of Bitcoin, who's anonymous.
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.760]   And actually most really big people
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.380]   in the cryptocurrency space do not,
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.900]   like yourself and others, do not dare claim that they are
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:25.180]   even for funds Satoshi Nakamoto.
[00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.100]   In fact, if Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive and is like,
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.780]   if say you were Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.020]   it seems like the thing he would do is probably,
[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.740]   or she, is try to remain anonymous.
[00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:39.300]   On the flip side of that, there's a guy named Craig Wright
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.060]   who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:45.900]   Satoshi Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people.
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:49.420]   So on him, if we could just linger on him,
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.180]   what do you make of this character?
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.420]   What are we supposed to make of this character?
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.100]   Should he be ignored?
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:58.680]   Is there any possible truth to his claims?
[00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.100]   What do you make of him?
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.620]   - The analogy that's at the top of my head
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.000]   will get a bit political, but that's fine.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.620]   You've had Michael Ballas.
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.540]   So I guess I view Craig Wright as being
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.500]   kind of like a Donald Trump figure,
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.180]   in that he's not very intellectual,
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:19.980]   but I think he gets a big audience because he says,
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:24.140]   he says things that play to the resentments that people have
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.860]   and he says things that people wants to hear.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.140]   Like in the wake of this block size war,
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:32.420]   the big blockers did feel very disenchanted.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:33.980]   Like they felt that, you know,
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.140]   Bitcoin always had this vision that we were supposed
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.700]   to just keep increasing the block size
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.220]   and Bitcoin is peer-to-peer cash.
[00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.540]   It says so in the white paper.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.580]   And then this elitist clique of core devs just like came in
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.580]   and said, you know, no, no, no,
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.720]   we're going to impose this totally different vision.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.260]   And if you ever want your scalability,
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:51.020]   you'll have to wait for us to create
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.380]   this totally unproven fancy technology
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.420]   called the lightning network
[00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:56.900]   that works under completely different principles.
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:58.420]   And, you know, they were very angry at this.
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.580]   And I mean, I think,
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.900]   like I think a lot of that anger is justified,
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.240]   but at the same time, you know,
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.540]   when people are in that mental state,
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.300]   like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.740]   And if you find someone who expresses anger
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.740]   at the same things that you're angry at,
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.740]   and also like, it seems like someone who's strong
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.620]   and seems like someone who, you know,
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.900]   might be good to rally around,
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.940]   it's very easy to just like get behind that.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:26.380]   - But that extra part about it,
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.500]   where he's Satoshi Nakamura,
[01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   I don't understand why that's necessary.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.220]   - I think that's, he could have done it without that,
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.740]   but that, I mean, that just, it's a marketing strategy.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.460]   Like it sort of gives him more salience.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.840]   Like there's other big block personalities, right?
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.020]   Well, what's the difference between, with Greg, right?
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.820]   He's not just a big, a big block personality.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.420]   He's potentially Satoshi.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.020]   And he did say all the big block things, right?
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.580]   Like he talked about how,
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.100]   oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally,
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.980]   like economically wrong, and it should be,
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.220]   it should be a free market,
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.060]   and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.620]   Like he repeated all the talking points.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.620]   And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?
[01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.340]   And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.320]   a big part of the Bitcoin cash community for a long time.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.580]   And then eventually, of course, you know,
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.020]   more and more people started to catch on.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.660]   He would just say technical things
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.140]   that are completely wrong, right?
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:27.780]   Like one example of this that I remember
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:36.440]   and two to the power of 256 bits, right?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.940]   So, you know, the difference is,
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.780]   it's like the difference between, you know, 80
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.740]   and the concept of 80 digit numbers, right?
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.780]   And because of this, like he made this argument
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:50.580]   that said that Bitcoin's elliptic curve
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.540]   is friendly to cryptographic pairings.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.500]   Like you don't have to understand what that is,
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.620]   but if you want to know,
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:58.340]   I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.460]   But basically he made this like technical argument
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.340]   that really hedged on this point.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.900]   And then when people pressed him on it,
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.340]   it was like, yes, what, no, no, like what, look, exactly.
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.260]   The height is like what, two to the 256 bits.
[01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:14.640]   That's a very tiny amount of information.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:17.060]   No, no, no, no, two to the 256 bits
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:19.500]   is more than the amount of information in the universe.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.460]   And like, you know, equivocated
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:24.100]   and kind of like preyed on people's inability
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.660]   to understand that mathematical nuance.
[01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:27.860]   And I called him out.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.260]   And eventually I even called him out in person
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.820]   at this conference in Seoul.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.620]   Like I just stood up and asked, you know,
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.820]   hey, you know, conference organizer,
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.500]   why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference?
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.340]   And I remember even some big blockers
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.460]   at the time getting angry at me.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.740]   But, you know, eventually they did get rid of him.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:50.820]   And then Craig, well, basically Craig Wright
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.260]   was forced to split off because the rest of the community
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.860]   refused to accept some network change that he wanted.
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.060]   And so then there was the BCH and BSV.
[01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.980]   And then in the Bitcoin Cash community,
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.680]   there was this drama of,
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.900]   are they going to add a developer fund
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.100]   where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.660]   from the miners to the devs?
[01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.300]   And according to the libertarian,
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.800]   not aggression principle is this technically theft.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.960]   (laughs)
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.200]   - Like his understanding of the technical depths
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.400]   of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way that you,
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.200]   Satoshi Nakamoto certainly would not.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.080]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.560]   But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged,
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.840]   the Bitcoin Cash community
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.420]   kept having these disagreements, right?
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.760]   And now after this development funds dispute,
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   there was a further split between Bitcoin Cash and ABC.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.560]   So, you know, the branching tree continues to extend, right?
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.400]   So.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.840]   - So in that way, it's disappointing
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.280]   to see those kinds of splitting.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   There was never a result.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.120]   - It is.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.840]   I would have definitely wanted to see more of a,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.040]   kind of like the principled coin
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.640]   with a, like tries to be Bitcoin,
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.840]   but follows consistent big block values.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.080]   But I don't know, maybe I should just like,
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.800]   stop expecting projects that I have no involvement in
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.200]   to care at all about what my values are.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.600]   And, you know, like maybe Ethereum just like is.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.440]   (laughs)
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.280]   - It's just this.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.360]   - I think you have a powerful voice
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.800]   and you can inspire other projects
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.040]   to live up to their best possible selves.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.180]   Okay.
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:24.680]   So that's the level, that's the layer one approach.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.120]   The other layer one within Ethereum
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.400]   is the idea of sharding.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.240]   - Yes.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.960]   - What the heck is sharding?
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.640]   Okay, what does the future of sharding look like?
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.360]   - Right, so to summarize that big, long tangent
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:37.200]   that we just went through.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.040]   - It's a beautiful tangent by the way.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.080]   - It's an amazing tangent.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.600]   And I think like crypto is just,
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.720]   one of the most underrated aspects of crypto
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.440]   is I think how you can like analyze the, you know,
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.960]   the sociology and the politics and the anthropology.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.920]   And like, yeah, I mean, I'm sure Dan Carlin
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.080]   would have fun exploring the space at some point.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.160]   But like the core trade off, right,
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.200]   is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way,
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.960]   just by increasing the parameters,
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:01.840]   then eventually you just make it harder and harder
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.040]   to participate as a node.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.800]   And you end up with a system where there's like
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.880]   20 computers running the whole thing.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.600]   And it's just very centralized.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.760]   So sharding basically says, well,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.680]   instead of just increasing the parameters,
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.600]   what we're going to do is we're going to change
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.080]   the blockchain architecture in such a way
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.720]   that each individual node in the blockchain
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.640]   only needs to store a small portion of the data
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.280]   and only needs to process a small portion
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.840]   of the transactions.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.240]   So you can think about it as being like
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.480]   inspired by BitTorrent, right?
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:33.320]   Like on BitTorrent, there's no such thing
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.960]   as a BitTorrent full node that has every movie, right?
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.680]   You know, the work is like split up
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.080]   among a huge number of computers.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.560]   And like, that makes sense.
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.760]   That's the only sane way to scale a system like that.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.960]   And if they actually tried making a version of BitTorrent
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.320]   that required full nodes that store every movie,
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.240]   then it would have like zero censorship resistance
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.280]   and it would just like, be dead in an instant.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   So the challenge with taking that model
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.000]   and applying it to blockchains, right,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.280]   is that blockchains aren't just about
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.600]   like spreading data around.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.840]   They're about agreeing on exactly what data
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.440]   was spread around and ensuring that everything
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.480]   that you agree on actually is correct.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.400]   And so you have this paradox where,
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.520]   let's say you want to have a system that supports
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.320]   10,000 transactions a second,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.800]   but each computer in the network
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:25.000]   can only personally verify 100 transactions a second.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.800]   So how can each computer get a guarantee
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.760]   about the other 9,900 without actually going
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.720]   and verifying them themselves?
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:37.360]   And it turns out that there are some,
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.320]   like a bundle of different tricks that can do that, right?
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:43.720]   So like one of them is just random sampling.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.920]   So the idea behind random sampling is,
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.840]   like let's say for simplicity,
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.520]   this is a proof of stake chain
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.320]   and you have 10,000 validators,
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.880]   validators are like, you know, the stakers.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.040]   And like for simplicity,
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:57.920]   we'll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   If someone has more coins,
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.880]   we'll just kind of split them up
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.640]   and pretend they're 10 stakers.
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.720]   Then you do like some random shuffling
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.760]   and you basically say,
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.320]   these random hundred validators
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.600]   are assigned to validate this block.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.920]   These random hundred validators
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.080]   are assigned to validate this block.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.280]   These random hundred validators
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.080]   are assigned to validate this block.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.560]   And so each individual computer
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.360]   only gets assigned to validate like a small piece,
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.520]   but then the way that the information
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.560]   about like what's valid gets passed around, right?
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:30.400]   Is that when these hundred participants validate a block,
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.080]   they all sign a message basically saying like,
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.200]   yes, we agree that this block is valid.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.680]   And then like they combine that signature into one
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.480]   and then they broadcast that signature.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.760]   And then everyone else,
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.400]   instead of verifying the blocks directly,
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.280]   just verifies that signature, right?
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.200]   And so if I see the signature,
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:49.080]   I'm not directly convinced that that block is valid,
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.280]   but what I am convinced of is that
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.000]   out of this committee of,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   or this randomly selected group of a hundred validators,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   let's say at least 70 of them
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.520]   agree that this block is valid.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.480]   And so if I trust that, you know,
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.200]   the majority of these participants are all honest,
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.400]   then because it's all randomly selected, you know,
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.600]   the attacker can't just like
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.280]   force themselves into one committee.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.720]   And so, you know, the attacker is gonna be
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.800]   evenly spread out too.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   And so if, you know,
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.760]   the entire set of validators is mostly honest,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.400]   every committee is gonna be mostly honest.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:22.480]   And so like bad blocks are not gonna go through, right?
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.760]   So that's like one simple form of sharding.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.920]   There's also other more clever things that you can do.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   So for example, there's this concept of ZK-SNARKs, right?
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.600]   Or call it a zero knowledge proofs.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.280]   So this is the idea that you can make
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.560]   a cryptographic proof that says,
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   I verified or I ran some complex computation
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:43.320]   on this piece of data and I got this answer.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:45.680]   And so if you make these kinds of proofs,
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.600]   then like if you see a ZK-SNARK
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.120]   that says some block is valid,
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.680]   then you're convinced that that block is valid.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.320]   And even if, you know, everyone in that committee is evil,
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.280]   like they have no way of making a valid proof
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.680]   for a bad block, right?
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.840]   Like, because the proof itself,
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.600]   like it is a proof that you did the computation
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.960]   where that proof is much easier to verify
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.800]   than just running the computation yourself.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   And, you know, there's once again, you know,
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.480]   super awesome mathematical cryptographic magic
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.880]   behind making ZK-SNARKs work.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.120]   - So it gives you a little bit of a leg up
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.280]   over the 51% honest assumption.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.720]   So it's a little hack that improves
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.400]   upon the random sampling thing.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.240]   - Exactly.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.280]   And like, there's other hacks, right?
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   Like there is another hack called data availability sampling
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.800]   that allows you to make sure that the data
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.040]   in the blocks was actually published.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.920]   But like, basically, like if you stack a couple
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.520]   of these tricks on top of each other,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.520]   you can create a system where like I,
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.160]   as an individual participant, can be convinced
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.800]   that everything that's going on
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.000]   in this distributed blockchain thing is correct
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.920]   without actually personally checking more
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.000]   than like a percent of it.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.040]   So that's sharding.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:52.880]   - That's sharding.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   But as I understand, maybe correct me on this,
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.080]   is in the space of Ethereum,
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.380]   the sharding happens on some fixed number.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.920]   Like the split is on some fixed number.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.440]   I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number.
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.760]   So how does that help scaling?
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.080]   Is it just a fixed constant scaling by 64?
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.800]   And is that a way to achieve those crazy,
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.200]   the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.320]   to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.480]   So doing like competing with credit cards
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.440]   and Visa and so on.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.280]   - Right.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.800]   So first I think like the 64 can be hard forked up over time.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.920]   So we have set it so that like there's theoretically space
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.200]   in the data structure for 1,024 shards.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.160]   It's just that 64 of them are turned on.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.280]   There are challenges with having more shards
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.780]   because like you have to have logic
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.280]   that just like checks and manages all of those shards.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.560]   And if there's too many of them,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.720]   then that becomes too expensive.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.600]   But even still you can improve quite a bit.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.440]   And then the other thing that we're doing is
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.980]   if we're getting maximum scalability
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.760]   by combining rollups and sharding.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.800]   So this might be a good time to talk about rollups.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:09.040]   - What are rollups?
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:09.880]   - Okay.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.640]   - Now we're moving into layer two ideas.
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.480]   - Yes.
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:17.480]   So the idea behind a rollup is basically that,
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.480]   so instead of just publishing transactions
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.840]   directly on chain and having everyone do all
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.760]   of the checking of those transactions,
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.000]   what you do is you create a system
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.680]   where users send their transactions
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:38.800]   to some central party called an aggregator.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.000]   And like, well, theoretically you can have a system
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.520]   where like the aggregator switches around
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.040]   or anyone can be an aggregator.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.600]   So it's still like permissionless to send things.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.160]   Then what the aggregator does is they strip out
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.080]   all of the transaction data that like is not relevant
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.800]   to helping people update the state.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.280]   So when I say the state, this is like,
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.040]   this is a very important kind of technical term
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:01.880]   for blockchains.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.640]   I mean like account balances, code,
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.680]   like things that are like memory,
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.400]   internal memory of smart contracts.
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.920]   Like basically everything the blockchain
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.280]   actually has to keep track of and remember.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.720]   Right, so you just put in,
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.600]   you take all these transactions, strip out all the data
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.720]   that's not relevant to telling people
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.840]   how to update the state.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.680]   And then you take the data that's needed
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.720]   to update the state, and then you like really compress it.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.840]   Right, so like for example, if we say, you know,
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.440]   I Vitalik have an account that's 0xAB58 blah, blah, blah,
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.680]   and it's 20 bytes.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.960]   Well, instead we can say, well, I have an account
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.800]   that is number 1874224 in the tree, right?
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.520]   And that goes down from 20 bytes to just like an index
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.120]   and a position, which is three bytes, right?
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.480]   So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tricks
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.360]   and you basically just, instead of publishing
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.600]   all these transactions,
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.440]   you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.280]   So the amount of data that goes on chain
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.680]   goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.160]   And then the second thing is that
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.200]   you don't do the computation on chain.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.480]   Instead you do the computation off chain,
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.160]   and there's one of two ways to do this, right?
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   One is called a ZK rollup, which is you just provide
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.800]   a ZK SNARK that basically says,
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   hey, look, I did this computation
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.400]   and I have this proof that here's the,
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.200]   here's the, you know, some hash of the result
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.360]   and it's correct.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.920]   And then you stick it on chain and everyone verifies
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:29.080]   this one proof instead of verifying all these transactions.
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.560]   And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup,
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.200]   which is basically made of the scheme where like first
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.760]   someone says like, hey, this is what I think
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.720]   the result of applying these transactions is.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.400]   And then someone else can say, I disagree,
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.600]   the result is different.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.640]   And only if two people disagree,
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.120]   do you actually do it on,
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.960]   do you actually just like publish all of the data
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.360]   and run that whole block on chain.
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.560]   So if there's disagreements,
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.880]   then you just like run everything on chain
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.640]   and whoever was wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.280]   So like disagreements are very rare
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.600]   and they're very expensive.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.520]   And in a ZK rollup, you don't even rely
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.080]   on this like challenging game at all,
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.760]   you just rely on a proof.
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.720]   So the core principle is basically that
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.760]   instead of lots of transactions and all the trends
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.600]   that everyone verifies every transaction,
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.640]   it is you take the transactions,
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.280]   you strip them down and compress them as much as possible,
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.360]   then stick that on the blockchain.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.440]   You do need to stick something on the blockchain
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   just so that everyone else can like keep up to date
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.000]   with the state so they know what all the contracts are,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.320]   what all the balances are and all of this,
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.400]   but it's a very small amount of data.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.240]   And then you use some, one of these other off-chain games,
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.480]   you know, could be this optimistic game,
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.080]   could be a ZK snark to just prove that
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.000]   somebody out there did the computation
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.520]   and the result is correct, right?
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:47.560]   So you're pushing like 90% of the work off-chain
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.080]   and then, well, 90% of the data
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.720]   and 99% of the computation off-chain,
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.280]   and then you still have 10% of the data
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.200]   and 1% of the computation on-chain.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.960]   And so, you know, your scalability goes up
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.880]   by a factor of about a hundred.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:04.880]   So these systems are already alive for some applications,
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.240]   right, so there's something called loopering,
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:10.080]   which is just a ZK rollup for payments, right?
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.440]   So you can have, you know, assets inside of the loopering
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.280]   system and you can go around and transfer them,
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.280]   but what you, and you get like much lower transaction fees,
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.600]   right, like instead of $5,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.280]   you'd have to pay like less than 5 cents.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.480]   But the only problem is that this only supports
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.920]   a couple of applications right now,
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.480]   like making one that supports anything
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.680]   that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work,
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.960]   but that's being done as well, right?
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.360]   So like within a few months, I'm expecting, you know,
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:47.360]   fully Ethereum capable rollups to be available as well.
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.720]   So then it's a rollups, just summarizing, you know,
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.040]   do most of the work off-chain,
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.440]   put only a little bit on-chain,
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.400]   factor of a hundred scaling, sharding,
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.880]   another factor of a hundred scaling,
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.120]   a hundred times a hundred, factor of 10,000,
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.280]   you know, hundreds of thousands of transactions a second,
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.120]   and like, you know, there's your scalability.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.600]   - Okay, so you achieve scalability,
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.040]   you can do a large number of transactions very quickly,
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.400]   and the cost of doing those transactions are much lower.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.960]   You wrote that in the long-term,
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.600]   ZK rollups are going to win in terms of layer two technology.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.760]   Specifically, you wrote, "In general, my own view
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.720]   "is that in the short-term, optimistic rollups,"
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.560]   as you were saying, "are likely to win
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.720]   "out of general purpose EVM computation,
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:33.720]   "and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments,
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.680]   "exchange and other application-specific use cases,"
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.120]   just as you were saying,
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.760]   "but in the medium to long-term,
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.880]   "ZK rollups will win out in all use cases
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.960]   "as ZK SNARK technology improves."
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.040]   Why do you think ZK rollups are going to win
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.920]   the big picture battle over layer two technologies?
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.280]   - So I think ZK rollups, once you accept
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:04.000]   that the technology works, are just conceptually simpler
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.480]   and they have nicer properties.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.000]   The reason is that they do not have this concept
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.160]   of a challenge game, right?
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.280]   As I mentioned, in an optimistic rollup,
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.440]   the way that you ensure that the results are correct
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.040]   is that you let one person submit,
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.480]   and they just submit with no proof.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.760]   They just say, "Here's what I think the result is,"
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.640]   and then if someone else disagrees,
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.960]   they make their own submission,
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.680]   and then if you have two disagreeing submissions,
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:26.000]   then you actually publish it on-chain
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.440]   and you see who's right.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:30.680]   But for this to work, you need to actually wait
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.160]   for someone to disagree, right?
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.000]   So for example, if I have an asset
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.560]   inside of an optimistic rollup,
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.920]   and I want to withdraw it,
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.880]   then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.280]   because if the block that contains my withdrawal
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.520]   turned out to be invalid,
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:45.520]   then there needs to be space
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.400]   for someone to disagree with it.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.760]   Whereas with a ZK rollup,
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.080]   you don't need time for disagreeing
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.240]   because you just have a proof, right?
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.840]   As soon as a block is submitted,
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.840]   there's a proof and you know it's correct.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.960]   - So if disagreements, especially in the long-term,
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   are sparse, then you don't want to do the optimistic,
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.360]   the game theoretic thing.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.920]   You want to do the ZK Stark.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.080]   - Right, the ZK stuff is just,
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.600]   like in a ZK rollup, you can withdraw immediately.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.440]   You don't have to worry about the economics
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.920]   of proving as much.
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.320]   There's just fewer issues.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.680]   The reason why ZK rollups are not winning everywhere today
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.000]   is because ZK Starks is still a crazy new technology, right?
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.840]   Like this is something that 10 years ago,
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.240]   it existed only in theory and there was none in practice.
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.920]   Then eight years ago,
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.520]   people were just getting excited about it
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.640]   in Bitcoin conferences for the first time.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:42.360]   Starting four years ago or three and a half years ago, even,
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:43.960]   that was the first time you were able to make
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.880]   any ZK Stark-based anything on Ethereum.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.520]   And then people started making them
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:52.080]   and ZK technology has only really become efficient enough
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.000]   to do a lot of things
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.800]   within the past maybe one and a half years.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.280]   So it's new technology, it's crazy technology,
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.840]   it's admittedly scary technology.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:03.840]   If you want to learn more,
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.320]   I also have an article about this on Vitalik.ca.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.120]   - It's actually really, really good.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:14.000]   Most of your writing, it's technical, but it's accessible.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.360]   I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitalik's articles
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.360]   and blogs, whatever you call them, on the website.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.600]   It's a brilliant summary of the work.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.640]   Actually, Ethereum documentation period is really good.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.000]   I think that's somewhat crowdsourced.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.400]   That documentation is really, really accessible
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.240]   and brilliant.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:37.360]   But let me ask about sort of other approaches to layer two,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.400]   like sidechain.
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   So the one popular one is Polygon.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.920]   What are your thoughts about Polygon,
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.000]   which is a layer two network?
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.840]   Is it positive, is it negative for Ethereum, is it both?
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.720]   Does it have a future, which is its own chain,
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.160]   but it's using Ethereum,
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.920]   it's like based on Ethereum, essentially.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.840]   Or maybe you can describe what it is.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.240]   - So I think there's a really big and important difference
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.000]   in security models between rollups and sidechains,
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.600]   which is basically that rollups inherit
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.160]   from the security of Ethereum, right?
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.120]   So like if I have coins inside of Loopering or Optimism
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.920]   or Arbitrum or ZK-Sync,
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.920]   then even if everyone else in the world
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.000]   who is participating in these ecosystems
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.560]   hates me and wants to steal my money,
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.760]   I can still personally make sure that,
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.600]   no matter what happens, I get my money out.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.480]   It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.840]   and I have to do transactions on the main chain,
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.560]   but I'll be able to do it.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.360]   Whereas in Polygon, which is a sidechain,
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.080]   and so instead of being secured by Ethereum,
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.160]   it's also in part secured by its own proof of stake consensus
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.320]   with its own token.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.560]   So if 70% of the whole,
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.600]   or even 51% of the holders of Polygon tokens
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.440]   wanted to take my money in Polygon, they can.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.480]   So that's the, and like, to be fair,
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.960]   like there aren't even,
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.320]   the supply I don't think is even
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.640]   that widely distributed, right?
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.840]   So like potentially you could,
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.680]   this idea of 51% of the token holders
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:16.120]   coming together and stealing everything,
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.400]   like it's not impossible, right?
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.640]   - Where does the scaling of Polygon come from?
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.280]   Like why is it able to process much more transactions
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.000]   than the Ethereum main chain?
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.560]   What's the idea there?
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.480]   - I think in part, like I imagine,
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.560]   I'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is,
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.720]   but like I imagine it has a higher capacity
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.680]   because it's a bit more willing
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.640]   to take centralization trade-offs.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.040]   And then another thing is that like,
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:44.960]   if the Ethereum ecosystem,
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.560]   like even if it did not do that, right?
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.120]   If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.960]   hypothetically scaling with side chains,
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.520]   then you would have a hundred copies of Polygon
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.320]   and they would each have their own tokens,
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.560]   they would each have their own chains.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.640]   And so even if each one of those chains
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.480]   was only as scalable as Ethereum,
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:02.960]   you could still, like the total sum of them
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.160]   would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.000]   - Okay.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.680]   - The thing that I want to say in Polygon's favor,
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.480]   just to be very fair to them,
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:16.000]   like I really, I definitely really respect
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.880]   the work that they're doing.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.800]   So, start with a bit with that word of,
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.560]   not criticism, caution, right?
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.560]   Like it's that they made this kind of deliberate trade-off
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.440]   for very pragmatic reasons,
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.120]   which is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.880]   And there are applications that want to do something now.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.320]   And if there aren't Ethereum friendly options for them,
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.400]   then like they're not going to just wait peacefully
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.680]   and do nothing for 12 months.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:46.840]   And they're going to go to either Binance Smart Chain
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.240]   or one of some other system,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.960]   potentially something that just has totally no alignment
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.240]   with Ethereum values whatsoever.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.520]   But whereas with Polygon,
[01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.840]   the best thing that you can say in Polygon's favor
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.760]   and against optimism is that,
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.480]   optimism is not live and Polygon is live, right?
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.480]   Like it just takes more work to create a system
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.360]   that has these extra rollups security features.
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.640]   And so Polygon just said,
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.960]   we're going to be the system
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.360]   that makes their pragmatic trade-off.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.560]   We're going to go functionality first,
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.960]   and then we can talk about adding back the security later.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.240]   So I've talked to them and like in principle,
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:28.880]   I think they're very open to the idea
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.760]   of like adding more security
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   and becoming a rollup or at least adding a Polygon chain
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.880]   that's a rollup at some points in the future,
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.520]   which is definitely something I think they,
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.080]   yeah, absolutely should follow through on.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.760]   But like the fact that like they exist now,
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.800]   and so applications can kind of bootstrap now on a chain
[01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.720]   that even though it's security isn't perfect,
[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:55.480]   at least it exists and people can go use it.
[01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.960]   And then over time,
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.000]   the chain matures as the applications mature.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.360]   Like, and it's, I think a very reasonable strategy
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.880]   and I'm definitely really happy
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:06.640]   that they're part of the ecosystem.
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:09.720]   - Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.960]   The history of cryptocurrency has this tension
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.120]   of really good ideas that are hard to implement,
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.440]   so they take longer to implement,
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.160]   and ideas that are not as good,
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.520]   but are faster to implement.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.240]   This is like the story of like,
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.360]   you have like JavaScript that basically took over the world
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.560]   because it was quick to implement within 10 days,
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.120]   and then like later kept fixing itself.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.880]   I don't know what to make of that.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.240]   Sort of from the engineering perspective,
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.400]   I'm more and more becoming comfortable
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.400]   in accepting the fact that our whole world
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.120]   will run a technology that's not as good
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.760]   as it could have been,
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.040]   just because the crappy solution is faster to implement
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.200]   and it sticks.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   What do you make of that tension?
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.840]   - I think the compromise that we've been taking
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:59.720]   within Ethereum is like,
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.840]   when we have to take the crappy solution,
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.920]   we look for crappy solutions that are forward compatible
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.480]   with becoming good over time.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.840]   When you build the quick and dirty thing,
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.080]   you would still already have ideas in your head
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.600]   about what the more complete thing
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.160]   with all the security features added on would look like.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.520]   - Even if it requires a hard fork?
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.360]   - Yes.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.040]   For example, with sharding,
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:28.200]   I think it's likely that the first version of sharding
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.680]   that comes out is not gonna have ZK-SNARK
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.760]   send data availability sampling, for example.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.920]   But we know what these technologies are.
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.800]   We feel like we have wrapped our heads around them.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.760]   And so we know how to build a system
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.640]   where we can put all the pieces in place
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.880]   so that it becomes very easy
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.640]   to bolt those components on in the future.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.000]   So if you do things that way,
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.200]   then at the beginning,
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:53.000]   you can have your system that has the functionality,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.600]   but say has less security or less sustainability
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.240]   or less of something else.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.960]   But then over time,
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:02.280]   it's designed in such a way
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.480]   that it has this easy on-ramp to adding those things.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.040]   And if you don't think explicitly
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.600]   about being future compatible,
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:12.560]   then you do often end up with a quick and dirty solution
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.040]   that backs you into a corner.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.920]   And then there are definitely cases
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.280]   where I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that.
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:23.280]   And we have had to expend pretty significant effort on,
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:26.800]   for example, removing features that we didn't realize
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:29.680]   that we actually can't sustain.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.840]   Like one big example is just increasing the gas costs.
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.480]   So like making some operations more expensive
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:37.680]   because they should be expensive
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.400]   'cause they actually take a lot of time to process.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.040]   So that's making some things more expensive,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.680]   kind of like taking some functionality away.
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.760]   So if you can be cognizant
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.080]   of where you're likely going into the future,
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:52.920]   and if you don't know,
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.320]   like even be cognizant of both the most likely paths
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.720]   that you'll take in the future
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.200]   and thinking about your roadmap
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.800]   and coming up with a roadmap where you know that
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.360]   like if you wants to do either of those things,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.520]   then you have a clean path toward it.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.920]   That's probably the best kind of practical way
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.120]   to get the best of both worlds that we have.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.440]   - Okay, let's talk about this wonderful process of merging.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:22.200]   Okay, so there's the main net,
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.400]   which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain or the,
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.360]   what should we say?
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.080]   The chain that uses proof of work.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.920]   That's the consensus mechanism.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.480]   And then there is, what is it called?
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:38.480]   The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:45.240]   And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.640]   is working.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.160]   So that was in December 2020.
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.400]   There's a bunch of questions around that
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.520]   that's fascinating as well.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.320]   But I think the most fascinating question
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.560]   is about merging those two.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.360]   When do the two chains, one that's proof of work,
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.520]   one that's proof of stake, merge?
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.240]   And what are the most difficult parts of this process?
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:12.000]   - Right, so as you've said, right,
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.640]   the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.240]   is that at first, the proof of stake chain
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.560]   just launches on its own, right?
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.160]   And this was the thing that happened in December.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.040]   And the proof of stake chain has been running
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.600]   for close to six months now.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.360]   I mean, by the time people watch this,
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.960]   it might actually be six months.
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:35.960]   But it isn't actually coming to consensus on anything
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.480]   except for itself, right?
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.400]   So the idea behind that is to just give
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.320]   the proof of stake chain time to mature,
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.440]   time for people to build the ecosystem around it,
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.160]   time to make sure that there aren't any bugs,
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.640]   and just like prove to the community
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.520]   that no proof of stake actually is real
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   and a full transition is realistic
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:57.480]   because the thing that you're transitioning to
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.400]   already exists and already works.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.120]   And then at some point in the future,
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:02.960]   you have this event called the merge
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.880]   where you basically take the activity
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.960]   that's being done inside of the proof of work chain
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.160]   and you actually move it over
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.280]   into the proof of stake chain
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.400]   so you get rid of the proof of work side completely.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   So the way that the merge will work is,
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.960]   it's definitely gone through a few different iterations.
[01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.840]   Like the earlier versions of this
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.760]   actually required more work for users
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.800]   and more work for clients.
[01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.240]   It was much more like, oh, there's this new chain,
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.200]   there's this old chain,
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.560]   and then everyone has to like migrate
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:34.880]   from the old chain to the new chain.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.360]   And then at some point, we'll forget about the old chain.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.400]   The new version is designed to be
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.480]   much more seamless for users, right?
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.920]   So basically what actually happens is that
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:49.280]   the old chain basically becomes embedded
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:50.920]   inside the new chain, right?
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.600]   So starting from the merge transition block,
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.800]   every proof of stake chain block
[01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.640]   is going to contain a block of the,
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:01.440]   what we consider now to be,
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.640]   what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today,
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.680]   but we'll call it the execution chain.
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:08.480]   And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks,
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.840]   you're not going to need proof of work anymore, right?
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.320]   So basically at the same time,
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.960]   you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.520]   for one of these blocks to be valid,
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:19.680]   but instead you require these blocks to be embedded
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.520]   inside of the proof of stake blocks, right?
[01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.960]   So you basically have like a chain inside a chain.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.160]   And this is, from an architecture perspective,
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.040]   you might think it's a little bit suboptimal,
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.200]   but it actually has some nice properties
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.080]   and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:38.000]   and think about the, what we call the execution layer,
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.800]   like transactions and contracts kind of separately
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.200]   and upgrade them separately.
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.480]   And it also just means that the upgrade process
[01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.720]   is extremely seamless, right?
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.760]   Because from the point of view of a client
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:50.880]   that's following the chain,
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.360]   you basically have to update nothing, right?
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.640]   You're still following the same chain
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.920]   and follows the same rules,
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.760]   except instead of checking proof of work,
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.000]   you'll switch to checking that these blocks
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.280]   are embedded inside of blocks of the proof of stake chain.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.000]   - So there'll be this merge block
[01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.040]   that will mark this transition.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   And over time, I guess,
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.480]   the new chain will contain the full record
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.320]   of all the transactions that's ever happened
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.600]   on the previous chain, on the old chain.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.840]   So like, maybe I'm asking a dumb question here,
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.480]   but in this process,
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.520]   is the new chain going to have all the information
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.040]   of the past transactions?
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.320]   - The new chain is not going to hold information
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.720]   from what happened in the Ethereum chain before the merge.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.840]   Right, so like Ethereum clients
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:43.320]   of the, that people are going to use
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.600]   like around the time of the merge
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:45.880]   and soon after the merge,
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:48.080]   they're probably just going to sync
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:50.560]   and check the proof of work chain up to the merge,
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.400]   and then they're going to check the proof of stake chain.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.520]   But at some point in the future,
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.080]   I think people will just stop bothering
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.200]   checking the proof of work before the merge.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.320]   - Got it, so that old history information is not important
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.880]   for the future, like if you're operating actively
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.280]   on the new chain, that history is not important to you?
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.800]   - It's not, let's see,
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.480]   so it's not strictly important for just like
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.800]   any like smart contract or just like applications
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.920]   that run on the blockchain.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.640]   It can be important to users
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.160]   and it can be important for some applications,
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.080]   but we're basically saying that like maintaining
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   and serving that is not going to be simultaneously
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.240]   the responsibility of every Ethereum node.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.640]   If you want that information,
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.320]   there can be separate protocols for backing it up.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.440]   And like these other protocols actually exist, right?
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.180]   Like there's something called the graph,
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.140]   which is doing some history retrieval.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.960]   Potentially you can just take that entire chain
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.160]   and stick it on BitTorrent.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.600]   Like there's lots of ways to like archive it
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:51.180]   and create kind of customized search protocols for it.
[01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.360]   - So what's your sense why,
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:55.400]   so there's a Python 2 and Python 3,
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:58.840]   and it took forever for people to switch.
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:01.560]   What's your sense why this merge
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.440]   has been taking longer than perhaps was expected?
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.760]   - I think the biggest reason is just,
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:11.000]   no, we've been underestimating the technical complexity.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.480]   There's a lot of technical complexity
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.520]   in making a successful proof of stake chain.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:17.160]   There's a lot of technical complexity
[01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:20.760]   in actually figuring out the transition process.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.320]   There's-
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.800]   - So that's bigger than social complexity.
[01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.240]   So it's the technical complexity you would say
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.000]   is the bigger reason for the,
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.160]   any delays than the social complexity.
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:32.400]   - I actually think so.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.080]   I mean, I think we've been very fortunate
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.720]   to not have too much social complexity around the merge.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.960]   - So not much drama.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.320]   - No.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.560]   I think the biggest part of the reason
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.760]   is just because we have been talking
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.040]   about proof of stake and sharding
[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.200]   as being part of the roadmap
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.960]   since almost the very beginning of the project, right?
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.400]   Like the very first proof of stake blog post
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.520]   is from January, 2014,
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.720]   which was two months after the project started
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:01.640]   and like maybe even a day after the announcement.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.000]   So, you know, proof of stake was,
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.040]   not something that we kind of put on anybody by surprise.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.120]   And then when the DAO fork happened
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.800]   and the people on the ETC side split off,
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.640]   I think it also just happens that a lot of the people
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.800]   that were not willing to stomach the DAO fork
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.360]   and then join the ETC side,
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.080]   they were the more Bitcoiny types
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.040]   and the more Bitcoiny types do also tends
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.800]   to like proof of work more.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.080]   And so like that also sort of ended up,
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.560]   sort of like purifying the communities on both sides,
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.400]   I guess.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.760]   So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.600]   and they're happy with their setup.
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.600]   And by the time that it came to the beacon chain launching
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.360]   and now I think the community is very strongly in favor
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:49.800]   of the proof of stake switch.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:55.760]   - But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear,
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:57.840]   which is the question of timeline.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:03.520]   When do you think the merge will happen?
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.320]   Do you have a sense it might happen this year?
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.800]   Do you have a sense it might be pushed
[01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:12.800]   towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.880]   - I think early 2022 is like the most realistic.
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.880]   There's definitely still like an optimistic case
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.840]   of it happening this year,
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.040]   but the realistic thing to count on
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.840]   is definitely the early part of,
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.400]   very early part of next year.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   - Is there specific things that stand out to you
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:38.240]   that are like, they'll make you feel good about progress
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.600]   if you see it happening?
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.760]   - So the thing that we had last month
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.800]   is we had this online hackathon called Rayanism
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.600]   where basically a bunch of the different client developers
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.520]   that are going to be part of the transition,
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.880]   like hacks together some test nets
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.520]   of the post merge Ethereum chain.
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.440]   So these were only test nets
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.080]   of what would happen after the merge.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.360]   They were not test nets of the transition itself.
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:06.280]   So the thing that people are working on now
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.240]   actually is the transition.
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.320]   So having a full specification
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.520]   of both the transition and post transition,
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.120]   I mean, we have specifications now,
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.720]   but in a realistic way,
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.680]   they'll probably needs to have a couple of changes
[01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.240]   and have things that continue to be ironed out
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:27.000]   and then have a test net that does both the transition
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:27.960]   and the post transition.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.080]   And then like, once you have a test network,
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.000]   then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   and then do some runs on not just a specialized test network
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.920]   but on say an existing test network,
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.160]   like a ROPS and a Rinkaby
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.520]   that Ethereum people already significantly use.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.360]   And if it works,
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.520]   then you can deploy the transition on mainnet.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.920]   - Just as a quick comment,
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.200]   'cause this is fascinating,
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.320]   in August of last year,
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.720]   there was this Madala.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:59.440]   - I believe it's pronounced Madasha.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.040]   It's a South American subway station, I forget where.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:04.520]   - But spelled with two Ls.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.160]   - Yeah, yeah, 'cause that's how Spanish works, right?
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:08.400]   Like the two Ls have--
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.320]   - Madasha.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.280]   - Yeah. - Okay, cool.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.520]   Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th,
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.820]   there was an incident on that test net.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:21.800]   How does this process work?
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.880]   Like what do you learn from those kinds of incidents
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.440]   when stuff goes wrong in the test process?
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.320]   - I think that incident was that
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.720]   there was a consensus failure of some kind, as I remember.
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.640]   Basically just different clients
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.080]   interpreting things in different ways
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.360]   and then one of them getting kicked off the network.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.960]   And then it ended up taking a while
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.000]   to actually get everyone to get back online.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.240]   Like a big part of the reason
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.760]   why it took weeks to resolve, right,
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.120]   is because it's on a test network,
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.200]   the coins are valueless,
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.560]   and so there's not really this big push of any kind
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.560]   for people to actually go and download a new client
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.500]   so they can start participating again.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.860]   And so it definitely took a while
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.000]   until the chain started finalizing again.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.520]   And then also there was, I think,
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:12.060]   another round of just not finalizing in October,
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:12.900]   as I remember.
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:17.280]   There were definitely things that we learned.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.720]   Like there were a lot of things,
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.880]   especially that client developers
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.840]   just learned about optimization
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.800]   and how to build their clients
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.520]   in a way that they can process things efficiently.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:30.360]   There's a lot that we learned
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.960]   from just seeing the full life cycle of what happens
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.520]   when more than a third of the validators go offline
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.000]   and then finalization stops.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   And then that kind of weird, unusual state of the chain
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.520]   continues for a while.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.600]   And then eventually everyone who was not participating
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.800]   just gets enough of their stake.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.720]   We don't use the word slashed,
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:51.920]   we use the word leaked for this,
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.400]   but basically also burned
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.080]   until the people who are participating
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.120]   go back up to two thirds
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.680]   and then the chain goes back to finalizing.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.080]   So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live,
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:04.440]   I think actually helped a lot
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:05.840]   and probably helped to really contribute
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.960]   to making us feel better about mainnet.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:11.400]   - I mean, there's also an incident just recently
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.120]   in April 24th of 2021,
[01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:19.240]   where this was on Beacon, I guess,
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.680]   there was a bug discovered in the software client Prism
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.440]   that prevented roughly 70% of validators
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.480]   on the network from producing blocks.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.800]   I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened,
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.360]   but broadly, like the big picture,
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.680]   what kind of stuff are you worried about
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:39.480]   in terms of problems that might arise?
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.280]   We're talking about small bugs,
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:44.400]   are we talking about like emergent,
[01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:47.720]   social, unexpected social bugs?
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.240]   You know, what are the things that worry you
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.640]   about the future of Ethereum
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.360]   that you want to make sure you construct mechanisms
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:55.440]   that prevent those things from happening?
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.920]   - So one of the lucky things there
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:59.280]   was that this particular bug
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.400]   only prevented proposed Zilsoft blocks,
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.200]   it did not prevent attestations.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.000]   All right, so attestations is just a mechanism
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.280]   for voting on blocks,
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.680]   and it's the attestations that are actually responsible
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:09.880]   for the chain finalizing.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.680]   So like coming to this more permanent agreements on blocks.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.320]   Right, so the chain was actually quite stable
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.320]   all the way through.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.080]   I think the thing that we generally learn
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.120]   from these experiences is just how valuable it is
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.400]   to have this multi-client network.
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:29.720]   Right, so this is one of these areas
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:31.680]   where I think Ethereum distinguishes itself
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.440]   from like Bitcoin, for example.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.800]   Right, that in Ethereum,
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.760]   we don't have one single client
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.640]   that everyone just runs, right?
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.520]   There's multiple implementations of the protocol.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.120]   And these multiple implementations,
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.440]   they all process and verify the blocks
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.560]   that each other can verify, right?
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.280]   So they all speak the same language.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.720]   Now, sometimes when there's a bug, they disagree.
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.240]   And when two clients disagree because of a bug,
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.120]   we call this a consensus failure.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.200]   And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:08.200]   And when you have clients monoculture like Bitcoin does,
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:12.680]   then like it's more rare to have consensus failures.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:13.880]   There you still have them actually.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.240]   Bitcoin had a consensus failure
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.280]   between two different versions of the same client
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.920]   back in 2013, but they're less likely to happen.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:23.960]   But the interesting thing is
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.720]   that the multi-client architecture has actually,
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.080]   I think, saved Ethereum much more than it's hurt it.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.000]   So even in this most recent incident, right?
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.480]   Like Prism was not producing blocks,
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.000]   but all the other clients were still producing blocks.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.120]   - There's four others, right?
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:42.120]   - Yes, it's Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:47.400]   And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun event
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.400]   that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:52.920]   They're called that because the attacks started
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:57.000]   right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.360]   that happens to be in Shanghai that year.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.440]   So what happens like basically was that
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:05.760]   someone came up with a way to create blocks
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.840]   that were very slow for one client to process,
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:10.200]   but not the other clients.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:12.920]   So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients.
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.080]   They were called Geth and Parity.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.960]   Right now, I think the top three ones are
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:20.760]   Geth, Nethermind, and Baesu.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.640]   But what happened as a result of us having two clients
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:27.000]   is that the attacker was just not able to come up with blocks
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000]   that both clients were like completely failing at processing.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.880]   And so like a lot of the miners
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.120]   and a lot of network participants,
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.800]   they just kept on switching between the two implementations
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:39.080]   depending on which one worked.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:44.040]   And that actually really helped the chain
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:46.200]   kind of survive through that month of attacks
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.000]   as the attacker just like kept on hammering at our system
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.240]   and identifying all of the weaknesses
[01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:55.080]   and just like forcing our clients to do this rapid sprint
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.120]   of just like optimizing the hell out of everything
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:00.160]   and make sure there aren't any of those DOS blocks
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.560]   or DOS bugs remaining.
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.800]   So that was another example.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.400]   And then like as a counter example,
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.960]   so like something that also shows the point
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.280]   from the other side,
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:13.600]   Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, right?
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.680]   The balance overflow bug.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.320]   Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:24.760]   and those outputs were both of a few billion Bitcoin.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:27.960]   So like about two to the power of 63 Satoshis.
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.480]   And then if you add those numbers together,
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.840]   you'll go above to the power of 64.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.120]   And of course, you know, computers,
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:36.960]   like once you go above to the power of 64, you wrap around.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.680]   And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.680]   to pay for the transaction 'cause it was asking for,
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.400]   let's say like a billion Satoshis or something,
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.040]   but actually it was asking for two to the power of 64
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.120]   plus a billion.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.360]   And so, you know, the attacker just managed to create
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.120]   like billions of Bitcoin out of thin air.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.320]   And this was not only discovered and fixed
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.800]   after something like 12 hours,
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.360]   but if there had been,
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.040]   if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system,
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.160]   then what would have almost certainly happened
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.680]   is like one of the clients would have bugged out,
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:13.280]   but the other clients would have probably, you know,
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.080]   actually had to check for that, right?
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.440]   And so there would have been a consensus failure,
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.440]   but at least that would have like alerted everyone
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.080]   that there is a problem very quickly.
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.680]   And it also would have given everyone
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.440]   just like obvious social permission to go and, you know,
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.480]   pick whichever one of the chains is correct
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.960]   and solve the problem.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:36.920]   So like, that's, I think, a big learning that we've had
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.200]   from multiple of our experiences
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.240]   in the Ethereum ecosystem,
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:43.280]   just like validating this multi-client model.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.120]   And to be fair,
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.160]   it's a model that we get criticized for a lot, right?
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.280]   Like Bitcoin people talk about, you know,
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.120]   the risk of consensus failures that this creates.
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:53.160]   VC types are like, well, you know,
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:54.960]   isn't it expensive and wasteful to fund
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.800]   three software teams where you could just be making,
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.480]   you know, one quote focused effort.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:01.440]   They love the word focused and like, you know,
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.480]   Ethereum is not that,
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.520]   but it's amazing despite not being that.
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:05.360]   - Yeah.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:12.600]   - Basically, yeah, so that was interesting.
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:16.680]   And then there have definitely been other learnings as well,
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:18.640]   just from like seeing the chain live
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.800]   and seeing what actually is the staking experience,
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.920]   like what are the actual incentives
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.480]   for all the different participants.
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.920]   So I definitely feel like we're gaining a lot
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.880]   from this sort of one year of trial running the chain
[01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.520]   before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.600]   - Let me ask perhaps a strange question,
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.280]   but, you know, proponents of Bitcoin will say things like,
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.720]   Bitcoin fixes everything.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.520]   So why do we need Ethereum
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:52.840]   versus like Bitcoin plus Lightning Network for scalability
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:56.320]   and then using Bitcoin for,
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.600]   with this proof of work for security?
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.840]   So in this kind of, it is perhaps sort of a strange question,
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.080]   but it's a high level question.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.360]   Why do we need another technology?
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.560]   Yes, it has a bunch of nice features,
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.120]   but like doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already?
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.080]   - So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin is,
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.520]   you know, these values of, you know, decentralization,
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.960]   creating these open provisional systems
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.720]   that anyone can participate in
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:27.200]   and that aren't just going to flop over and die
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.840]   if whoever created them gets bored
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:33.640]   and like that are resisted to like whoever runs them,
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.400]   breaking the rules and all of these things, right?
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.680]   And I think that pretty strongly that these principles
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.640]   are like really valid and important
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.560]   to much more things than just money, right?
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:45.080]   Like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money
[01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.080]   and Ethereum is built from the start
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.840]   as a general purpose blockchain, right?
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.600]   It's, you know, there is ether the asset on Ethereum,
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.720]   but then you can also make, you know,
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:58.280]   decentralized financial things, what we call DeFi today.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.560]   You know, you can make like ENS,
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.440]   the decentralized domain name system.
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:05.040]   You can put, make prediction markets on it.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:09.240]   You can make totally non-financial systems
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:12.000]   that just like keep track of whether or not
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.440]   some certificate was signed
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.760]   or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:21.320]   There's this big long list of like just interesting things
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.480]   that you could use about blockchains to do, right?
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.520]   Like basically they are sort of the missing piece
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.360]   that we are without them,
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.600]   the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.800]   can do is very limited.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.760]   And once you have them,
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.440]   you know, a lot of those limitations end up going away.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.440]   And so Ethereum was like always from the beginning
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.040]   about that, right?
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:45.160]   It's about like, hey, this isn't just money.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:48.160]   There's so much more that you could do
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:51.520]   if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.040]   or, you know, digital institution or DAO
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:55.520]   or whatever you want to call it,
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.600]   where you, the kind of the base layer of the logic
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.880]   is just executed in this open and transparent way
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:03.360]   where everyone can see what's going on.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:05.320]   Or, you know, if you like your zero knowledge proofs,
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.320]   at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:09.520]   that what's going on follows the rules.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:13.600]   And you don't need to just constantly keep trusting
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.960]   centralized actors.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.040]   And-
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.640]   - Hence the smart contracts.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:18.480]   - Exactly.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.480]   - As being a sort of a core technology as part of Ethereum.
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:22.320]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.720]   Smart contracts, the computer programs
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.800]   that are running on Ethereum,
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:27.680]   they are like the core of what makes
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:29.680]   Ethereum general purpose.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.280]   So I think, like, I do think that, you know,
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:37.120]   there's a lot more wrong with the world than just money.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:37.960]   Right?
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.760]   Like I'm not one of these people who thinks that,
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.080]   you know, if you get rid of fiat currency
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.480]   and you replace it with cryptocurrency,
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.360]   then suddenly wars are going to go away, right?
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.960]   Because like, first of all, you know,
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.280]   like say in your rush revenue is only a small portion
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:51.440]   of government revenue, right?
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:54.320]   It's like what, five, 10%, something like that.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:58.880]   Second of all, like if you are the sort of,
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:00.080]   this is one of the things I don't even get
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:00.960]   about their philosophy.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.680]   Like, let's say you're the sort of person who is a,
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:06.560]   like an extreme and very distrusting libertarian.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:09.280]   And you think that these governments are terrible, right?
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:13.600]   Like we know today that governments fund a combination of,
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.040]   you know, things like welfare
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.440]   and things like, you know, the military that,
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.960]   you know, goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan, right?
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.200]   And so the question you have to ask is like, okay,
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.200]   you with your new, you know, magic newfangled cyber currency
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:32.080]   that takes over the world,
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.480]   take away the government's ability
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:34.880]   to have seniorized revenue.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.680]   And so you reduce the government's revenue by 10%.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.400]   If the government is that evil,
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.640]   which portion of its expenses
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.640]   is it going to take that 10% from?
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:45.800]   Is it going to stop the bombing people in Afghanistan
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.640]   or is it going to cut welfare?
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.600]   If you think it's the first,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.600]   you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   So that's, I guess my perspective on like why the whole,
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:50:00.440]   you know, we're going to save the world
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:04.480]   and create peace by like denying governments
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:07.680]   the right to stealth taxation kind of perspective
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.480]   doesn't really make much sense for me.
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:11.200]   And I do think that there is real value
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:14.920]   that comes from a decentralized and open currency.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.320]   Like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.280]   that anyone in the world can, you know,
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.400]   go ahead and use, right?
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.480]   Like it's, that's something that can easily
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.680]   be a big boon for people, right?
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.880]   There's a lot of places where the currency
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.680]   and is much less stable than the dollar.
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.880]   And, you know, these people like they don't like,
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.520]   well, if they use Bitcoin,
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.240]   their only option is to get Bitcoins, right?
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:41.320]   Which, you know, are also pretty volatile.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.280]   If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get ether,
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.000]   but then they can also get stable coins, right?
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.800]   And you might think that, you know,
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.840]   oh, you're not being ideologically pure.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.160]   Now you're giving them stable coins,
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.360]   which are mirroring dollars.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.320]   And obviously dollars are going to collapse too.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.720]   But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.440]   than the Venezuelan Bolivar.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:03.440]   So like there are really meaningful
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.960]   and beneficial things that you can give to people
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:09.080]   by having a global and open financial system.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.720]   But I think if you want to actually do that,
[01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.160]   like you have to have much more than just a currency, right?
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.280]   And then if you want to go beyond financial things,
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.960]   then, you know, you have to obviously
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.880]   have much more than a currency.
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:23.560]   And then, you know, you also have to actually
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.920]   take scalability seriously
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.640]   'cause the non-financial applications,
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:29.280]   like nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:33.840]   - Can we return to dogs?
[01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.680]   - Sure.
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:35.520]   (dog barking)
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:38.320]   (laughing)
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.200]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.800]   - The other one's categorically forbidden.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.320]   - Yeah, categorically forbidden.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.960]   Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats, actually?
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.880]   - I think there are.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.600]   Like there was Catcoin, there was Nandcoin.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.240]   For some reason, they just didn't catch on
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.160]   as much as the dog coins did.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:56.360]   - Okay, so let's talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:00.440]   Elon said that, quote,
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.640]   "Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10x,
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:09.640]   increases block size 10x, and drops fee 100x.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.080]   Then it wins hands down," end quote.
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:18.240]   You said in a blog post, partially responding to that,
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.560]   that there are subtle technical reasons
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.080]   why this is not possible.
[01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:28.760]   To this, Elon said that you, quote, "fear the Doge."
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.560]   So let's talk about this.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:34.560]   What are the technical hurdles for Dogecoin
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.880]   that prevent it from becoming
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.800]   one of the primary cryptocurrencies of the world?
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:41.240]   And do you, in fact, fear the Doge?
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:43.560]   - I definitely feel obligated to correct the record.
[01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.400]   I definitely do not fear the Doge.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.120]   - Okay. - No, I love the Doge.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:50.440]   I actually visited the Doge in Japan a few years back.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:53.920]   She's an amazing dog, she's still alive.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:55.080]   - Wait, the original Doge?
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:56.600]   - Yeah. - Oh, wow.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:02.840]   - So, you know, we accept Doge every year
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:05.560]   for our annual DEF CON conferences.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.560]   So I definitely don't think Ethereum is opposed to Dogecoin.
[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.760]   I kind of want to feel like Ethereum
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.000]   is at least a little bit in spirit itself a Dogecoin.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.920]   And then, as I mentioned, I love Doge.
[01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920]   I bought a bunch of Doge.
[01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:22.520]   I still hold a bunch of Doge.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.560]   On the scalability question,
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:29.840]   the challenge basically is the limits to scalability
[01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.920]   and the trade-offs with centralization.
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:33.920]   If you just increase the parameters
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.920]   without doing anything else,
[01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:37.280]   then it just becomes more and more difficult
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.640]   for people to validate the chain.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.240]   And it just becomes more likely
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.960]   that the chain becomes centralized
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:45.920]   and becomes vulnerable to all kinds of capture.
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.760]   - So does it need some of the layer two technologies
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.960]   that we've been talking about?
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:53.560]   - I personally think that if Doge
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.640]   wants to somehow bridge to Ethereum
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.600]   and then people can trade Doge thousands of times a second
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.600]   inside of a loop ring, then that would be amazing.
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:05.240]   If they want to just take ZK roll-up style technology
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.480]   and just have thousands of transactions a second
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:10.160]   on their own chain, then that would be
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:11.440]   a great outcome as well.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.600]   - So is there ways for Ethereum
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:16.120]   and Dogecoin to work together?
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:22.000]   So there's a power behind a person like Elon Musk
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.160]   pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:28.520]   Is there ways to leverage that power
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:31.240]   and that momentum to improve Ethereum,
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.720]   to improve some of the sort of cryptocurrencies
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:38.040]   that are already technologically advanced
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.400]   and pushing forward that kind of technology?
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.240]   - I definitely think there's room for-
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:48.960]   - You know that meme of Doge taking over?
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:50.400]   - Yes, yes, I've seen it.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:53.800]   - Is there a way to ride that storm,
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.120]   that wave of the Doge taking over?
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:00.280]   - I think if we can have a secure Doge to Ethereum bridge,
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.960]   then that would be amazing.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.360]   And then when Ethereum gets its scalability,
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.520]   any scalability thing that works for Ethereum assets,
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:10.360]   you would be able to also trade wrapped Doge
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.840]   with extremely low transaction fees
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.240]   and very high speed as well.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.560]   - Is there precedence for building secure bridges
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:17.960]   between cryptocurrencies?
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.160]   How difficult is this kind of task?
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.920]   - It's definitely something that's in its infancy.
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:26.440]   There definitely have been some cross-chain interaction
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.160]   things that have been done before.
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:31.120]   So the earliest is probably the concept of merge mining,
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.320]   when a chain just makes its entire proof of work algorithm
[01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:38.720]   dependent on the proof of work algorithm of another chain.
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.920]   And so I think famous Dogecoin
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.440]   actually merge mines to Litecoin,
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.120]   which is, I think in retrospect,
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:45.520]   it's not looking like a very good choice
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.720]   because now Dogecoin is bigger than Litecoin.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.960]   But if there's potentially some way for Dogecoin
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.040]   to merge mine with an Ethereum proof of stake
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:55:59.040]   and stuff some kinds,
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.480]   then that could be an interesting alternative.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:06.560]   So that's one type of chain interaction.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.600]   As far as bridges, like one chain reading another chain,
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.880]   early in Ethereum's history,
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:12.960]   there was this project called BTC Relay.
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.600]   It's a smart contract on Ethereum
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.960]   that just verifies Bitcoin blocks.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:20.040]   I think people stopped really caring about
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.280]   and maintaining it because there just weren't enough
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.680]   applications that were actually interested
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.680]   in using it at the time.
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.520]   And then the transaction fees got too high
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.960]   to actually maintain it.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.480]   So I think if we want to make a BTC Relay 2.0,
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.360]   that becomes cheaper because it uses snarks
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.320]   or something like that, then you probably could.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.120]   But maybe now's the time when you actually
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.440]   can do that sort of one-way verification.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:46.120]   But the one challenge though is that
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:47.840]   if he wants to have a bridge
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:50.000]   that allows you to move assets between chains,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.120]   then you don't just need one-way verification,
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:54.000]   you need two-way verification.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.520]   And Ethereum can verify anything
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.120]   because Ethereum smart contracts
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:58.840]   can just run arbitrary code.
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:02.120]   But if you want Bitcoin to be able to do things
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:03.880]   based on what happens in Ethereum lands,
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:06.240]   then Bitcoin would have to basically,
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:07.840]   well, they can do everything with soft forks
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.600]   'cause that's their religion, but they'll do it that way.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:15.160]   And if Doge wants to make a fork
[01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:19.920]   where that allows for two-way transferability
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:22.080]   with Ethereum, then they could.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:24.680]   I mean, I think that would be a lovely collaboration
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:27.280]   to make if there's interest.
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.880]   I think there might actually even be some multi-SIG funds
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.440]   that has some funding.
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:35.680]   It's just a bounty for someone
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.400]   to make a bridge between the two.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:38.760]   - Oh.
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.080]   Could you maybe try to psychoanalyze Elon Musk
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:42.640]   for a brief second?
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.640]   So what are your thoughts about Tesla and Elon Musk's journey
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.960]   through the cryptocurrency world?
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:53.160]   So first with Bitcoin and then with Dogecoin.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:57.440]   So acquiring and holding a large amount of Bitcoin.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.520]   And I believe, at least considering the acquiring
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.720]   and holding a large amount of Dogecoin,
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:06.560]   positives, negatives, what do you think the future
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:10.120]   for Tesla and SpaceX in the cryptocurrency space looks like?
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.040]   Do you think they'll consider Ethereum?
[01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:17.680]   - I'm sure that if they stay in the cryptocurrency ecosystem
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.680]   at all, then they have to at some point.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:22.280]   (Lex laughing)
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:27.040]   You know, Bitcoin, number one, Dogecoin, number,
[01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.440]   I mean, you know, come on, it deserves to be number three.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.320]   And then, or number two.
[01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.720]   And then Ethereum can be whatever that other number is.
[01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:37.400]   (Lex laughing)
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:42.680]   - If Ethereum only becomes a dog coin somehow,
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.440]   maybe change the logo to incorporate a dog of some sort.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.320]   Almost like Doge sneaking behind.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.200]   - Oh, that would be fascinating.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.120]   - That's when the merge happens.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.480]   - And I think, like Elon, you definitely,
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:58:59.640]   I think you would make a mistake if you were to kind of
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:03.200]   ascribe too much like sophisticated, malevolent,
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:07.280]   or any deep intentionality to the whole process.
[01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:10.160]   I think, like, he's just a human being and he likes dogs,
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.280]   just like I like dogs.
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:14.120]   - Yeah, I think that is literally the reasoning
[01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:16.240]   behind the whole Dogecoin thing.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.680]   There is some aspect to which, I mean,
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.680]   the guy helped launch a car into space, right?
[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:27.560]   Like, you could ask, like, what is the purpose of that?
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.400]   I think the purpose of that is fun.
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:35.200]   I think he truly is, more and more, especially lately,
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.760]   embodying the whole idea that the most entertaining outcome
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.320]   is the most likely, and he's fully embracing
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:44.060]   the most entertaining outcome.
[01:59:44.060 --> 01:59:46.240]   And in many ways, Dogecoin is the most
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:48.320]   entertaining cryptocurrency.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.840]   As cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.420]   in the world, people are getting more and more serious
[01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:55.980]   about it, and so he's selecting the cryptocurrency
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:59.280]   that is the least serious and the most fun.
[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:03.280]   And there's something to that, like coupling fun
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.780]   with technological sophistication,
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:10.320]   and somehow figuring out a way to do that well.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:12.400]   - You know, I want the world to be fun.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:14.240]   I think the world being fun is great.
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.840]   - Okay, let me ask about a couple
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.680]   of the technologies, if it's okay.
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:20.520]   - Sure.
[02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:22.680]   - What are your thoughts about Chainlink
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:24.760]   and hybrid smart contracts that utilize
[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.920]   off-chain external data sources?
[02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.360]   - And I think it's definitely necessary
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.280]   for a smart contract so that you do a lot of things
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:36.720]   to use off-chain data of some kind, right?
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:38.480]   Like, if you want to have a stable coin,
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.840]   you need a price oracle so you know
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.400]   what price you're targeting.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.520]   If you want to have some fancy crop insurance gadget,
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.200]   like I think Ether Risk has been doing a lot
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.840]   of good work with that, and I think it was either Kenya
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:54.640]   or Sri Lanka or both, like they're making a lot
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:59.200]   of good progress in some of those places.
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:01.600]   Like, you need some kind of oracle to tell you,
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:04.300]   you know, did it actually rain in this particular area?
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.240]   If he wants to have, like, assets that mirror
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.320]   other financial assets, you need an oracle.
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.960]   If you want to have a prediction market, you need an oracle.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:15.400]   And so projects that provide oracles
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:18.240]   are definitely really important.
[02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:20.320]   There are definitely different kinds of use cases,
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:22.340]   like Augur is more about events,
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.820]   and the Augur oracle is designed, I think,
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.040]   differently from Chainlink, right?
[02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:28.920]   Like, Chainlink emphasizes the whole, you know,
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.600]   like we have a fast automated thing
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.680]   that just gives you data quickly,
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.720]   whereas Augur is more, you know,
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:38.160]   we don't give a crap about speed.
[02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:39.960]   And look, we don't need to give a crap about speed
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.360]   because if you want to get your money out
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.240]   on a prediction market that where in reality it's resolved,
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:47.080]   you can probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:51.520]   So, I mean, I think, I mean, Chainlink is definitely,
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.280]   like, taking a good, important part
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.400]   of the oracle design space.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.880]   And I'm definitely happy that there's, like,
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.640]   that project's taking the task on.
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:04.480]   I mean, at the same time, I do think that, you know,
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:07.160]   their frog army on Twitter can get a bit intense at times,
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:08.860]   but like- - The frog army?
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:11.500]   Is there a way to incorporate sort of oracle network
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:14.460]   type of ideas into Ethereum?
[02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:17.900]   - I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer,
[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:20.860]   like, stay away from trying to provide
[02:02:20.860 --> 02:02:22.980]   too much functionality because, like,
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:27.140]   once you have the Ethereum base layer making a claim
[02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:31.580]   about, like, say, the US dollar to Ethereum price,
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:34.180]   like, at some sense, you're basically saying
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:37.300]   that, like, Ethereum as a base platform
[02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:40.100]   starts making what could be geopolitical statements.
[02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:40.940]   - Right. - Right?
[02:02:40.940 --> 02:02:43.460]   Like, for example, you know, imagine if there was some,
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.380]   you know, civil war and the US split up
[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:46.420]   and you had two currencies
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:47.900]   that both claims to be the US dollar.
[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:50.900]   Well, you know, Ethereum would have to pick one
[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:53.020]   for the sake of everyone who was already using that oracle.
[02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:54.940]   So, you know, does that mean that the blockchain
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:02:57.380]   would be, like, taking a position
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:02:59.380]   in this big mega-political debate?
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:03.540]   So, I think, like, for just those kinds of reasons,
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:08.180]   I would personally, like, prefer Ethereum itself
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:11.340]   to be more of this sort of pure platform
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.780]   that just analyzes transactions,
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:16.380]   just mathematically using, like,
[02:03:16.380 --> 02:03:17.860]   deterministic consensus rules.
[02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:20.220]   And then if you need the oracles, that can be layer twos.
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:23.540]   Like, I think Ethereum, like, benefits
[02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:26.260]   from not trying to do everything at layer one
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:29.260]   and having this, like, very robust layer two ecosystem
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:31.340]   where you have all these projects doing interesting things.
[02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:34.020]   - Yeah, focus on the basic technology, avoid the politics.
[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:34.860]   Gotcha.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.940]   Let me ask a bit of a human question.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:43.740]   Charles Hoskinson, someone you've worked with
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:45.980]   in the early days of Ethereum,
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:48.820]   there appears, to my outsider view,
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:51.060]   to have been a bit of a falling out.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.980]   Is there a positive, inspiring human story
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:56.600]   to be told about why you two parted ways?
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:01.740]   - I kind of want to let the various books
[02:04:01.740 --> 02:04:04.260]   about Ethereum speak for themselves,
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:07.940]   but, you know, I feel like, you know,
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.420]   since that time, I think, you know,
[02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:14.180]   Charles has clearly, I mean,
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:16.860]   progressed and matured in a lot of ways.
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:19.700]   And people who follow Charles closely
[02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.140]   have definitely told me that, you know,
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:24.140]   like, 2021 Charles is very different from 2014 Charles.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:26.500]   And I'm sure 2021 Vitalik is much different
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.500]   from 2014 Vitalik as well.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:32.380]   - I'm kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 Vitalik
[02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:34.060]   and Charles look like as well.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:35.380]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:37.420]   - Like the progression of the humans.
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:39.140]   - Is this going to be one of those things
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:40.740]   where, like, everyone comes full circle
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:43.260]   and then 2030 Vitalik and Charles are best friends?
[02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:45.620]   - Yeah, not necessarily best friends,
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:47.100]   but some kind of,
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:51.820]   are able to reminisce in ways that is,
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:55.460]   that puts some of the tension of the past behind.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.460]   - I think such things are possible.
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:05:01.380]   I think, you know, people definitely,
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:02.820]   absolutely have a right to,
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:06.220]   and I think should strive to just constantly change
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:07.420]   and reinvent themselves.
[02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:11.100]   - Is there something you could say about your thoughts
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:15.540]   about the Cardano project that Charles Hoskinson leads?
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:19.220]   They've worked on some interesting ideas
[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:22.700]   that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum,
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:27.660]   proof of stake, working on smart contracts
[02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:28.860]   and all those kinds of things.
[02:05:28.860 --> 02:05:31.420]   Is there something, again, positive,
[02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:33.140]   inspiring that you could say?
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:34.380]   Are they a competitor?
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.300]   Is it complimentary technology?
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:39.940]   - There's definitely interesting ideas in there.
[02:05:39.940 --> 02:05:42.420]   I mean, I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different
[02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:44.580]   approach than Ethereum in that, you know,
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.580]   they really emphasize having these big academic proofs
[02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:51.580]   for everything, whereas Ethereum tends to be more okay
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:54.300]   with heuristic arguments, in part because it's just trying
[02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:55.980]   to do more faster.
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:59.700]   But there's definitely very interesting things
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:02.460]   that come out of IOHK research.
[02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:05.420]   - Can you comment on that kind of idea?
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:08.860]   I, as sort of having a foot in research,
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:12.180]   enjoy Charles's kind of emphasis on papers
[02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:14.340]   and deep academic rigor.
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:18.780]   What's the role of deep research rigor
[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.560]   in the world of cryptocurrency?
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:21.400]   - Interesting.
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.580]   I'm actually the sort of person who thinks
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:23.900]   deep rigor is overrated.
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:27.340]   The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated
[02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:32.340]   is because I think, in terms of why protocols fail,
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:37.020]   I think the number of failures that are outside the model
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:39.340]   is even more important, is bigger and more important
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:41.580]   than the failures that are inside the model.
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:44.180]   Right, so if you take selfish mining, for example,
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:48.620]   that original discovery from 2013 that showed how
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:56.180]   Bitcoin does, even if it has a 50% fault tolerance,
[02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:00.500]   assuming everyone's honest, it only has a zero to 33%
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:02.760]   fault tolerance, depending on your network model,
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:05.140]   if you assume rational actors.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:09.300]   And to me, that was a great example of an outside
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:10.180]   the model failure, right?
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:14.020]   Because traditional consensus research, just up until,
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:17.260]   before the blockchain days, did not think about
[02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:19.420]   incentivization much, right?
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:21.620]   There was a little bit of thought about incentivization.
[02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:24.380]   There's a couple of papers on the Byzantine Altruist
[02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:26.860]   rational model, but it wasn't that deep.
[02:07:26.860 --> 02:07:29.180]   It was mostly operating under the assumption that
[02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:33.020]   we're gonna make consensus between 15 participants
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:36.260]   and these are institutions, and if something goes wrong,
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:39.500]   then we can figure out whether or not it was deliberate
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:42.100]   offline, and if they did something evil, we can sue them.
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:44.500]   Whereas in the crypto world, you can't do that, right?
[02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:47.700]   And so, that whole discovery basically arose
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:52.700]   just because the model of traditional consensus research
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:56.140]   didn't cover those possibilities, and then once you go out
[02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:59.100]   of the model, those other issues do exist, right?
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:03.340]   So, but then at the same time, there definitely are
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:07.220]   protocols that turn out to be, that do have failures
[02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:08.180]   inside the model.
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:12.780]   Like this reminds me of the time when I found a bug
[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:16.900]   in a proposed consensus implementation from either
[02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:18.180]   BitShares or EOS.
[02:08:18.180 --> 02:08:20.100]   This happened around the end of 2017.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:24.420]   So, that was definitely inside the model because they had
[02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:26.340]   a very clear idea of what they were trying to achieve.
[02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:29.380]   They had a very clear description, and there's a very clear
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:32.020]   mathematical argument for why the description doesn't lead
[02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.020]   to what they're trying to achieve.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:35.820]   But ultimately, what you're trying to achieve can never
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:38.340]   be fully described in formal language, right?
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:42.580]   Like this is the big discovery of the AI safety people,
[02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:43.420]   for example, right?
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:48.020]   Like just having a specification of what you want
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:49.780]   is an insanely hard problem.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:53.300]   And like the more powerful the optimizer that you're giving
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:56.260]   the instructions to, the more you have to be careful.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:01.260]   And so, you know, I think there are kind of these two sides.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:07.540]   And then the other thing is that a lot of the academic
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:11.100]   approach ends up like basically optimizing for other people
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:12.940]   inside of the academic system.
[02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:17.780]   And it doesn't really optimize for like curious outsiders.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.940]   Whereas like I personally, Matt, like totally optimize
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:23.140]   for curious outsiders, or at least I feel like I strive to.
[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:28.140]   So I guess like that's my case for why I like tends
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:32.620]   to behave in ways that, you know, occasionally traditional
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:35.140]   academic types criticize as being reckless.
[02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:39.660]   But I mean, on the other hand, you know, there's definitely
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:43.660]   real benefits that come from like just taking
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:47.700]   a rigorous approach, especially when, you know,
[02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:50.980]   you know what the thing, like you know what the specification
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:53.100]   is of what you're trying to get.
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:56.420]   And like, you're trying to kind of improve your way
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.700]   or provide protocols that actually provide that.
[02:09:58.700 --> 02:10:00.740]   And like, you know exactly what you're looking for.
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:04.260]   I feel like realistically, you probably want to do
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:05.940]   both kinds of analysis.
[02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:08.180]   And like sometimes even want to do both kinds of analysis
[02:10:08.180 --> 02:10:09.020]   in stages, right?
[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:11.740]   Like you have, you want to do more quick and dirty things
[02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:14.140]   and even wants public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff.
[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:16.140]   And then later on you formalize it more
[02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:17.740]   and then you get more feedback.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:23.540]   Like in general, I guess I feel like the norms of research
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:27.660]   in the future, like the internet has just changed so much.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:28.980]   There's no way that it's not going.
[02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:32.020]   And you know, it's even changed like collaboration
[02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:34.380]   structures and like the patterns in which we work
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:35.460]   with each other.
[02:10:35.460 --> 02:10:38.220]   There's no way that the correct structure
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:40.700]   for collaborative research is the same
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.100]   as what it was 15 years ago.
[02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:46.460]   But like what combination of these existing components
[02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:48.900]   and of new ideas it is like that's something that's,
[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:52.260]   you know, totally legitimate to kind of fight it out.
[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:54.780]   And I think it's great that there's a different ecosystems
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.020]   that have different attitudes to things.
[02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:58.780]   Like, you know, I think, you know, there's a big possibility
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.100]   that, you know, things that the Ethereum,
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.660]   ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.980]   some problems is totally wrong.
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:06.340]   And if there's other ecosystems with different principles
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:09.340]   and they do well, that's something that we can learn from.
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:11.300]   - In the spirit of the depth first search,
[02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:13.260]   can you comment on AI safety?
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:15.500]   And some people are really worried about
[02:11:15.500 --> 02:11:18.400]   the existential risks of artificial intelligence.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:22.340]   Is there something you could say that's hopeful
[02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:26.700]   about how we avoid in the same kind of line of reasoning
[02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:30.100]   about creating formal models versus kind of looking
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:33.380]   outside the model into what the real world actually is like.
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:36.580]   Is there some lessons from that we can take
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:40.460]   and map onto the AI safety world where the potentials
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:45.260]   of the technology, whether it's in autonomous weapon systems
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:47.140]   or just the paperclip problem,
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:50.820]   that we can avoid AI destroying the world?
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:54.380]   - So my impression is actually that like,
[02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:56.860]   this is more of a kind of far away impression
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.540]   and it could be wrong, that it might even be
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:01.500]   that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.860]   Like because AI is very practitioner oriented, right?
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:08.620]   Like it's all about like, hey, I found a couple of hacks
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:11.020]   and look, I ran them and look, they seem to improve
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:15.980]   classification accuracy from 0.684 to 0.773.
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:19.660]   So a lot of the time, there just isn't actual science
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:23.220]   behind why this hack works and why this other hack
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.980]   doesn't work, you just sort of like trial and error
[02:12:24.980 --> 02:12:25.880]   your way into it.
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.140]   And I could see how that approach works,
[02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:32.740]   but at the same time, like that approach is not good
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:35.340]   for eligibility, for example, it's not good
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.780]   for like understanding what the heck is actually going on,
[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:41.980]   like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail.
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:45.900]   Like there's even a debate on like,
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:49.140]   can you take GPT-3 like things and just scale them up
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:51.300]   and their intelligence will continue to improve
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:53.660]   or is there just like some types of reasoning
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.940]   that they're fundamentally bad at
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.380]   and like they're not gonna get good at it
[02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.740]   no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach
[02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:01.180]   and add more hardware to it.
[02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:06.180]   So having like thinking about what's going on
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.380]   more explicitly, I mean, my understanding is that
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:12.100]   a big part of AI safety research is trying to do
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.860]   that sort of stuff, right?
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:14.820]   - Formalize.
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:19.180]   - Yeah, formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility,
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:22.180]   like trying to understand if the AI makes some
[02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:25.520]   classification so we can actually see like what happens
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:27.840]   and look what's going on in the middle, right?
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:31.200]   Whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography,
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:33.960]   it's like very much not, well, okay,
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:35.240]   I mean, I should quite say that.
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:37.920]   It's traditional cryptography is this interesting mix
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.200]   of being very formal and being very informal
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:43.520]   because it's very formal with given
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.760]   these security assumptions prove that the protocol
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:47.520]   works under these security assumptions.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.440]   The places where it's very informal is like,
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:51.320]   well, how do we even know that there isn't
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:53.480]   an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:56.000]   Yeah, we kind of tried it for 40 years
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.600]   and then so far no one's found anything better
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:01.240]   than the general number field sieve and like,
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:03.560]   okay, fine, we'll just assume it's fine.
[02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:07.120]   How do we know you can't find the discrete log
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.520]   between two elliptic curve points?
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:11.040]   Like, nope, did it a couple of decades,
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:14.260]   no one's found anything faster than like baby step,
[02:14:14.260 --> 02:14:15.760]   giant step stuff.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:20.760]   So that's, and like there's definitely ways
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.980]   in which that approach really makes sense, right?
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:28.840]   Because at least you can concentrate your analysis
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:30.860]   on a small number of building blocks.
[02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.040]   And like, you do have some intuitive reasoning
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:34.840]   about those building blocks, but like at least
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:36.400]   there was a small number of building blocks
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:38.040]   and lots of people are looking at them.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:40.440]   And then everything else just sort of gets formally built
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.720]   on top and you actually can like mathematically
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:45.660]   reduce the security of big things to building blocks, right?
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:49.240]   Like you can have mathematical proofs that say,
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.480]   if you make a ZK-SYNARC of a yes statement
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:54.480]   when in reality that statement is false,
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:59.360]   then you can use that to like extract information
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:00.800]   out of elliptic curves that, you know,
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:03.820]   it completely breaks the problem or something like that.
[02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:04.660]   So-
[02:15:04.660 --> 02:15:08.560]   - So ZK-SYNARC is an example where formalism is beneficial.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:09.400]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.360]   - And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:14.560]   in the AI safety within AI systems
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.760]   that you can get a hold of some kind of aspect
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:21.360]   of the systems that you can control provably.
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.120]   - And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency,
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.360]   I think the one area where consensus mechanisms
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:29.000]   is still more an art than a science
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.040]   is that these aren't just like technological systems,
[02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:33.560]   they're crypto economic systems, right?
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.380]   And they make assumptions about people.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:37.760]   And which assumptions you can make about people
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:39.520]   is not something that you can prove with math.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.520]   - Right, even just the basic 51% people are honest.
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:47.360]   - Can you trust the 51%?
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:49.200]   If you can't trust the 51%,
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:53.380]   can you trust the other 49% to be able to coordinate
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:55.120]   on making their own fork?
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.760]   What will happen to coin prices?
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:00.440]   How do people as human beings react to these events?
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.360]   There's all of these assumptions.
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.040]   But at the same time,
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:05.680]   if you can write down the assumptions,
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:08.520]   then you can do formal things with them.
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:10.440]   - I almost forgot to ask you
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.360]   about one of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum.
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:14.600]   I mean, it's non-technical.
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.600]   I think it's societal, it's social, which is NFTs.
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:24.660]   So what do you think about the explosion of NFTs
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:26.340]   in the recent months,
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:29.980]   especially in the art world and beyond?
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:31.680]   And what does the future look like?
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:35.820]   So this is maybe the social impact on the world,
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.720]   on the individual creators of all kinds.
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:42.500]   Is that something you've actually expected to see,
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.740]   NFTs having this kind of impact?
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:48.140]   And beyond, what do you think will happen
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:51.700]   in the digital space with NFTs,
[02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:54.540]   in virtual reality, in gaming, all those kinds of things?
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:59.260]   - I was definitely surprised by NFTs in particular.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:02.240]   I even actually, I think, might be on record somewhere
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:03.780]   on some tech conference panel.
[02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.220]   They were asking,
[02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:07.460]   it was one of those overrated or underrated sections,
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:08.540]   and it asked about NFTs.
[02:17:08.540 --> 02:17:10.020]   And I thought, and I said,
[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:11.820]   hey, I think NFTs are overrated.
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:14.420]   And in retrospect, that turned out to be quite wrong.
[02:17:14.420 --> 02:17:17.540]   I think, I guess I just personally
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.980]   can't really relate to this concept
[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:22.500]   of spending a lot of money on a thing.
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:27.380]   There's no clear understanding
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:31.160]   of why that thing would maintain its value.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:34.700]   - Uniqueness of a thing having value.
[02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:35.700]   - Right, exactly.
[02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:40.220]   I definitely cannot really understand
[02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:43.420]   the psychology behind paying $200,000
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:44.540]   for original art painting.
[02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:46.260]   I'd be like, if I had a man,
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:48.580]   he should just give me photocopies of everything.
[02:17:48.580 --> 02:17:52.260]   You can hang three photocopies of the Mona Lisa.
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:53.420]   Why would I even have the Mona Lisa?
[02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:56.180]   I think I'd probably just have some Nyan cats or something.
[02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:57.740]   - That's one thing where mathematics
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:00.060]   or theoretical computer science cannot formalize
[02:18:00.060 --> 02:18:02.420]   why the heck NFTs are valuable at all.
[02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:06.700]   - But the thing that makes me very happy
[02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:08.740]   about the space now that it has happened
[02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:11.740]   is that, this gets back to the conversation
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.020]   that we had at the beginning.
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:14.500]   I'm interested in this concept
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:17.620]   of decentralized public goods funding.
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:20.860]   I want things that are good and valuable
[02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:23.780]   to as much as possible also be things
[02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:27.060]   that can economically sustain the people who produce them.
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:29.060]   Because if you don't have that,
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:32.060]   then either the public goods just don't get produced at all
[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:34.620]   or people make centralized versions
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:37.100]   that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes,
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:39.340]   but actually just like concentrate control
[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:40.440]   in a very small group.
[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:43.820]   Both of those things are not very nice.
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.260]   The nice thing about NFTs would be,
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:49.580]   well, if you're an artist and you can just mint NFTs
[02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:50.660]   and this is a source of revenue,
[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:52.700]   then like, great, that's another stream of revenue
[02:18:52.700 --> 02:18:57.020]   for creative work that often does still get underfunded.
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:18:58.140]   And that's amazing.
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:18:59.500]   - Okay, let me ask you a weird question.
[02:18:59.500 --> 02:19:01.300]   We talked about Craig Wright a little bit,
[02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:06.300]   but a lot of people write to me, one of two emails.
[02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:12.980]   One email is calling any coin outside of Bitcoin
[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:18.980]   a scam, and then the other email is saying,
[02:19:18.980 --> 02:19:22.720]   my favorite coin is the best coin,
[02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:25.320]   it's going to save the world, whatever that coin is.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:30.140]   And so I sit back and I look, I have no idea.
[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:34.020]   I try to figure out like the humans
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:38.140]   that I trust in this space, just the basic human qualities.
[02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:41.820]   But do you think some coins are scams?
[02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:46.060]   Do you think some coins, maybe another way to ask it,
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.700]   are scammier than other coins?
[02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:51.360]   How are people that are looking outside of this space
[02:19:51.360 --> 02:19:53.660]   where there's all of these cryptocurrencies
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:57.540]   supposed to figure out what is a scam and not,
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:59.500]   or how do you use the right kind of language
[02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.220]   when talking about them?
[02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:03.260]   Because there's the harshness of the language
[02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:06.220]   from the Bitcoin maximalists that doesn't just say
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:08.620]   everything's a scam, including Ethereum,
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:11.580]   but they use terms like shitcoin
[02:20:11.580 --> 02:20:14.220]   that says it's not only a scam, it's like a waste of time.
[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:17.100]   I mean, every word you can use, they say that.
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.460]   That's very harsh.
[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:22.060]   And then some people are just, apply the word scam
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:26.780]   much, much more conservatively and just refer to coins
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:29.260]   that legitimately are trying to scam people
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:31.420]   out of their money as scams.
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:33.100]   So what do we do with this word scam?
[02:20:33.100 --> 02:20:35.420]   Should it ever be applied to coins?
[02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:39.280]   And is it a binary thing or is it a gray area?
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:42.860]   - I think it's definitely a gray area.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:46.300]   There's definitely things that are really and actually scams.
[02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:48.260]   Like, I mean, BitConnect would be one example
[02:20:48.260 --> 02:20:51.660]   of something that's a way on the scam spectrum.
[02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:54.900]   Did you see their 2017 promotional video, by the way?
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:55.980]   - Oh, BitConnect? - Yeah.
[02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.620]   ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
[02:20:57.620 --> 02:20:59.100]   ♪ What's up, what's up, what's up ♪
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.500]   ♪ BitConnect ♪
[02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:03.740]   It was this three minute, 48 second video
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:07.820]   that was just of this guy making this totally crazy rant.
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:10.740]   And it was at some conference in Vietnam
[02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:12.940]   where they were, of course, trying to convince
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:14.580]   a whole bunch of people to buy this coin
[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:17.700]   and they had these claims about how it would go up in value.
[02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:20.580]   That was definitely the peak of these pure,
[02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:24.500]   completely scammy coins.
[02:21:24.500 --> 02:21:27.660]   And that was definitely really terrible.
[02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:29.660]   And I actually, I feel like we have less,
[02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:31.660]   despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger,
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:34.860]   we actually have quite a bit less of that now.
[02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:37.820]   But then, of course, there's this spectrum
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:40.220]   of things that are not completely scams
[02:21:40.220 --> 02:21:42.540]   and then things that are not scams
[02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:44.420]   and that are technically totally fine projects,
[02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:48.500]   but where their community is just incredibly sketchy.
[02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:50.580]   And then all the way to things
[02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:52.460]   that are where the community is nice,
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:55.380]   but maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable
[02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:56.660]   of achieving what it's trying to do
[02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:57.980]   or in the community doesn't realize.
[02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:00.140]   And then really good projects.
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:04.020]   So if you wanna go a step,
[02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:06.780]   if that's 100% scam,
[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:09.580]   then what would I call, say, 80% scam?
[02:22:09.580 --> 02:22:11.220]   Bitcoin SV is one example.
[02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:13.620]   This is a Craig Wright's fork of Bitcoin.
[02:22:13.620 --> 02:22:15.580]   Theoretically, it's a blockchain, right?
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:16.980]   It's a fork of Bitcoin.
[02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:20.180]   It has 512 megabyte blocks.
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:23.340]   If you really wanted to, you could use the blockchain.
[02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:24.660]   It satisfies the properties
[02:22:24.660 --> 02:22:27.220]   that you can send transactions onto it.
[02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:31.540]   You can probably use it as a backup to store your files
[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:35.780]   if you really wanted to, just because it has so much space.
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.020]   It might fail, but
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:42.020]   it's, but at the same time,
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:43.580]   like, you know, as we basically said,
[02:22:43.580 --> 02:22:46.460]   like Craig Wright is a scammer
[02:22:46.460 --> 02:22:49.580]   and like half the community is just totally batshit insane.
[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:53.260]   - So the humans, the humans of a particular cryptocurrency
[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:54.980]   is what makes for a scam and not,
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:22:57.580]   like the humans at the top that have a voice
[02:22:57.580 --> 02:22:58.900]   guiding the community.
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:01.660]   - Yeah, like I think, you know, in the case of BSV,
[02:23:01.660 --> 02:23:04.780]   the humans, they make just completely wrong
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:07.620]   and just obviously wrong claims
[02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:10.140]   about like what BSV is capable of accomplishing
[02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:12.620]   and what it conceivably could accomplish.
[02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:15.260]   And like, there's just a lot of aspects of it
[02:23:15.260 --> 02:23:17.100]   that make it feel like a money grab.
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:18.380]   So that's one example.
[02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:20.780]   And then, you know, you gotta go a bit further
[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:23.420]   and then, you know, you have like the trons of the world
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:25.580]   and like, you know, that's a platform, you know,
[02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:27.980]   you can use it, you can do, you can do stuff on it.
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:30.140]   But at the same time, like, you know,
[02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:33.660]   they did plagiarize the IPFS white paper and then,
[02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:34.580]   you know, they-
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:36.180]   - So the scam equalities.
[02:23:36.180 --> 02:23:37.020]   - Yeah.
[02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:38.540]   - The thing that throws me off a lot,
[02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:40.860]   this makes it very difficult for me,
[02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:45.620]   is that most coins, but the ones that make me feel like
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:49.540]   are scammy, have a large community of people
[02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:53.140]   that are super positive about it.
[02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:54.720]   Like, and they'll write to me.
[02:23:54.720 --> 02:24:00.500]   Now that said, sort of on the flip side of that,
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:04.180]   Bitcoin people are also very positive.
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:09.180]   There's some sense, the reason I was having like squinty eyes
[02:24:09.180 --> 02:24:12.620]   looking at Bitcoin for quite a while,
[02:24:12.620 --> 02:24:14.780]   is like, why is everyone so positive?
[02:24:14.780 --> 02:24:18.020]   I was getting total cult vibes.
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:22.380]   Like, the ideas are not grounded in truth,
[02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:26.460]   but are grounded in an obsession of like,
[02:24:26.460 --> 02:24:29.020]   when you can artificially conjure up a truth,
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:31.700]   which is why I was a little bit like worried about Bitcoin.
[02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:33.280]   I think I've learned a lot since then
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:38.280]   to where like, I learned to separate the community
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:42.300]   from the ideas, and I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea
[02:24:42.300 --> 02:24:46.460]   on many fronts, but still a community that's like
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:48.940]   dogmatically excited about something,
[02:24:48.940 --> 02:24:51.260]   whatever that is, makes me skeptical.
[02:24:51.260 --> 02:24:53.700]   Maybe it's just like my upbringing,
[02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:56.940]   but when everybody's really excited about something,
[02:24:56.940 --> 02:25:00.420]   it makes me skeptical.
[02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:03.800]   But it also makes me difficult to decide
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:05.600]   what is a scam or not, because some of the most
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:08.040]   exciting ideas in this world have a community
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:09.680]   of people who are excited about it, right?
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:12.360]   'Cause it's, I don't know.
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:14.840]   I think space exploration is super exciting,
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:17.960]   and there's people, I know a lot of them,
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:21.400]   that are exceptionally excited about space exploration.
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:23.360]   Does that mean it's a scam?
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.840]   No. - No.
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:26.200]   - So I don't know what to do with that,
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:28.680]   and so most say just try to stay away, I suppose,
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:31.080]   but it's unfortunate, because I'm sure there's
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.720]   a lot of exciting technologies in that space.
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:35.640]   - Like in the case of Bitcoin, I would definitely
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:36.840]   not call Bitcoin a scam.
[02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:39.320]   - Right. (laughs)
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:40.160]   Right.
[02:25:40.160 --> 02:25:43.320]   - I would also not call Litecoin a scam.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:45.160]   There's people who call Litecoin a scam
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:47.480]   because they just say, oh, look,
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:49.320]   it has no fundamental use case,
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:52.800]   and the concept of being silver to Bitcoin's gold
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:56.840]   is just stupid, and milli-Bitcoin is the silver
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.200]   to Bitcoin's gold.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:03.080]   But at the same time, if you have these people
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:06.600]   who just, they do seem to earnestly believe this,
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:10.440]   and they're trying to just make Litecoin be Litecoin
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.000]   as best as they can, then to me,
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.960]   that's enough for it to not be a scam.
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.800]   - Yeah.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:21.400]   - And then, so yeah, I think the biggest gray area
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:26.400]   is definitely between projects that are earnest,
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:31.280]   but they have just all sorts of these different
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:33.560]   combinations of flawed qualities to them.
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.400]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:36.800]   - I mean, the ones that legitimately is a scam
[02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:39.200]   is when the key people that are at the head
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:42.440]   of the project are intentionally lying.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:46.520]   And I think as long as the intent is to try
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:49.840]   to do good in the world, even if your actual
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:51.840]   implementation of that is flawed,
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:53.560]   I think that's not a scam.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.700]   It could be flawed ideas, it could be wrong ideas,
[02:26:55.700 --> 02:26:56.800]   but it's not a scam.
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:00.600]   I'm learning to navigate this space.
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.960]   - Yeah, it's definitely a very challenging space
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:04.840]   to navigate.
[02:27:04.840 --> 02:27:08.400]   I mean, it's in some ways a reflection
[02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:10.240]   of the world at large.
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:13.020]   - Yeah, and as we've said, maybe offline,
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:15.200]   that the fact that money is involved
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:17.480]   makes it a little bit more complicated,
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:22.480]   that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies
[02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:25.680]   that are taken on.
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:28.920]   So it makes it more real, more painful,
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:31.720]   more elevated, the impact of this.
[02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:35.120]   - Like imagine Mac versus PC wars,
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:38.480]   if everyone who bought a MacBook had 10 Apple shares
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:40.160]   inside of it, and everyone who had a PC
[02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:42.320]   had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it.
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:45.920]   And then you had the elites who bought their Macs
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:48.920]   back in 1983, that they spent $500 dead,
[02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:50.320]   and now they have $40 billion.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.640]   So they just think that they're these gurus
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:55.320]   who understands the future of finance and geopolitics,
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:58.640]   and they make theories about why Apple
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:00.680]   is the one that's gonna bring freedom to the world,
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:05.080]   and Windows is secretly aligned with the axis of evil.
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:06.080]   - Oh, that's brilliant.
[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:07.680]   So yeah, this is so brilliant.
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.520]   So I think the right way to think about this
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.620]   is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:14.760]   into the space of like Emacs versus Vim,
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:19.320]   or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.040]   that came along with each implementation of,
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:25.600]   each PC, each Mac, that's fascinating.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:28.840]   This is 100% correct, 100% correct.
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:31.160]   'Cause then that really energizes the armies
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:32.640]   of people debating over this in a way
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:35.560]   that something without money does not.
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:38.560]   Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:41.500]   that you are also excited about, which is longevity.
[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:44.280]   Anti-aging.
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:48.280]   You have donated money to the Sense Foundation.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:50.800]   So you have an interest in this whole space
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:51.980]   of lifespan research.
[02:28:51.980 --> 02:28:54.560]   What's your vision here?
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:28:58.000]   Or what do you hope to see in anti-aging
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.880]   and longevity research?
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:03.120]   - I think I hope to see the concept
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:06.440]   of seeing your parents and grandparents die,
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:08.920]   just slowly disappear from the public consciousness
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:10.680]   as an experience that happens
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:12.600]   over the course of half a century,
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:15.080]   the same way that getting lost in a city
[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:16.960]   slowly disappeared over the public consciousness
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:19.760]   over the last 50 now that we have smartphones.
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:21.960]   - The thing you have from Nick Bostrom,
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:26.240]   the essay pinned in your Twitter,
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.240]   argues that essentially that death is almost unethical.
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:34.440]   Like the fact that we don't do something
[02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:37.560]   about this thing that, in the essay,
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:42.560]   is a dragon that keeps murdering everybody around us,
[02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:46.000]   including our parents and grandparents,
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.640]   is like the fact that we don't try to do something
[02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:50.480]   aggressively about that dragon
[02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:53.360]   doesn't make any sense.
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:58.540]   So you think this is a battle worth fighting,
[02:29:58.540 --> 02:30:01.760]   a battle for immortality or at least longevity?
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:02.680]   - I'd say absolutely.
[02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:07.680]   And I'd say it's a battle where we really have started
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.560]   over the last five years in particular
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:13.080]   to see the first cracks of humanity
[02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:16.080]   starting to make things that look like
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:17.480]   they'll turn into victories.
[02:30:17.480 --> 02:30:22.680]   - Do you think humans can eventually live forever?
[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:26.120]   And maybe as a side comment to that,
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.000]   what technology do you think will enable that?
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.960]   Is it genetic modification?
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:30.780]   Is it cloning?
[02:30:30.780 --> 02:30:32.400]   Is it uploading your mind?
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:33.240]   - Define forever.
[02:30:33.240 --> 02:30:35.360]   Like are we talking a thousand years, a million,
[02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:38.480]   10 to the 14, 10 to the 45?
[02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:40.520]   - Well, let's start, as I tweeted today,
[02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:43.040]   eventually everything, the universe will be filled
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:44.760]   with super massive black holes.
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:49.120]   So that forever maybe like backtracking to where--
[02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:52.440]   - We'll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out.
[02:30:52.440 --> 02:30:54.140]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:30:54.140 --> 02:30:59.920]   Yeah, maybe travel between the multiverse,
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.960]   between the different universes of the multiverse.
[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:07.960]   I mean, but forever meaning like, you know, millennia.
[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:13.920]   I definitely think that we can get there.
[02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:15.880]   I definitely think that it's the sort of thing
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:19.280]   that's going to take an insanely huge amount of work.
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:21.880]   And I definitely think it's the sort of thing where,
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:24.760]   you know, once we figure out the first crop of problems
[02:31:24.760 --> 02:31:27.640]   and like people start living to 150,
[02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:29.680]   we'll just realize that there's like 10 other problems
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:32.120]   that kill you half as slowly and we'll have to do more work.
[02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:34.480]   But you know, the good news is that this,
[02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:37.240]   this is Aubrey's longevity escape velocity argument
[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:39.960]   that if you get everyone to live to 150 now,
[02:31:39.960 --> 02:31:41.720]   then you know, you have half a century to fix
[02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:44.320]   to all those other problems as well.
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:47.380]   So I'm optimistic for that reason.
[02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:52.080]   I think you definitely do not want to underestimate
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:54.480]   human ingenuity, especially over the longterm.
[02:31:54.480 --> 02:31:56.400]   Like just to look at what happens to computers
[02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:58.480]   between, you know, the ENIAC in 1950
[02:31:58.480 --> 02:32:00.000]   and where we are in 2020, right?
[02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.720]   Like that's a span of 70 years.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:04.640]   So like, you know, both of us, I think,
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:07.720]   with just present day technology,
[02:32:07.720 --> 02:32:11.080]   I mean, we have at least 70 more years to live.
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:13.000]   So just like imagine what kind of sea change
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.120]   will happen in biomedicine during that time.
[02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:17.800]   And the other thing that made me optimistic
[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:22.480]   is that I actually think COVID has been this kind of event
[02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:26.520]   that's really kind of pushed biomedicine
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:29.800]   and especially like activist approaches to biomedicine
[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.420]   really into the public consciousness, right?
[02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:36.200]   Like it basically, it's put people into this mindset
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:37.840]   that, you know, wait, like, you know,
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:39.840]   it's not just like, you know, the bits and tweets
[02:32:39.840 --> 02:32:41.600]   that are gonna save the world.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:46.040]   You know, the bio was actually like super important and huge
[02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:51.040]   and, you know, ultimately what's ending COVID basically,
[02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:54.040]   you know, is the vaccines and the vaccines
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:56.160]   have just been, you know, amazing.
[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:01.160]   And if you can take that energy and restart,
[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:04.840]   and also like this, I think, philosophical attitude
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:06.800]   that I've noticed, like I think the way
[02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:09.960]   that I would describe the philosophical attitude here,
[02:33:09.960 --> 02:33:12.000]   this is going more depth first,
[02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:15.840]   is that I think the way that I kind of interpret
[02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:19.560]   part of what I would call late 20th century ideology
[02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:21.760]   is that there is this mentality that, you know,
[02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:25.600]   nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad.
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:28.680]   And generally you wanna minimize disruptions from nature.
[02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:29.960]   And like this exists everywhere
[02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:31.160]   in the political spectrum, right?
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:33.280]   So there's nature as in literal nature.
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:35.760]   And my view is that like the right wing version of that
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:37.400]   is markets as nature, right?
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.400]   - Markets as nature.
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:42.920]   - Yeah, like, you know, the way that, like,
[02:33:42.920 --> 02:33:45.360]   that kind of philosophy talks about, you know,
[02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:48.240]   markets and like the goal of not interfering with them,
[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:51.400]   like, you know, it is very kind of like nature styled.
[02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:53.880]   And then of course, you know, the conservative one,
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:56.920]   which is like traditional culture that existed
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.480]   before the activists started controlling everything
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:01.960]   as also being a kind of nature.
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:05.280]   But the 21st century attitude and like really COVID,
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:08.640]   you know, has flipped a lot of minds
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:10.800]   because with COVID what's happened is that,
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:13.720]   well, no, like it's not nature is not safe, right?
[02:34:13.720 --> 02:34:15.760]   The default is that is like, you know,
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:17.880]   untold misery and suffering
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:19.640]   in tens of millions of people dying.
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:23.360]   The only way out for us is through like basically
[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:25.800]   human ingenuity.
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:29.000]   And that frame of mind is one that's like
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.360]   much more friendly to one,
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.240]   this other change of minds that I want to see,
[02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:37.760]   which is like basically treating aging
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.560]   as an engineering problem, right?
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:43.320]   Like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:44.880]   that are currently on this earth are gonna die
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:47.280]   and they're gonna live their last decade of life
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:48.800]   in a debilitating pain.
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:51.920]   And the only way to stop that is human ingenuity.
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:54.520]   And, you know, we don't have that solution yet,
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:56.640]   but you know, if we work hard, we will.
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:34:58.680]   - And more and more people on the biology side,
[02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:00.760]   computational biology, are basically converting
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:05.320]   the mess of the human biology into an engineering problem.
[02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:07.360]   And once that conversion is happening,
[02:35:07.360 --> 02:35:09.840]   looking at the genetic code, the proteins,
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:10.680]   all those kinds of things,
[02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:12.360]   once that conversion happens,
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.760]   you can now apply the tools
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:17.120]   that we know how to solve engineering problems
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:18.120]   to solving it that way.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:19.760]   And then there's also the other version,
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:24.520]   which is, you know, why do we romanticize this meat vehicle
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:28.480]   that ultimately is just a thing that carries the brain,
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:30.440]   maybe we can more and more convert ourselves
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:32.520]   into the digital realm.
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:33.960]   This is where like Neuralink,
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:35.640]   have the brain-computer interfaces
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:38.640]   and then achieve immortality in the space of information
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:40.920]   in the digital space versus in the biology space.
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:42.640]   - That stuff's interesting too, I agree.
[02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:45.960]   I mean, I think, you know, we have enough resources
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:48.040]   and we should just try all the parallel tracks.
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:50.240]   You know, it's great that we have people
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:51.480]   just trying to make our bodies work.
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:54.440]   It's great that we have people trying to upload
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:56.520]   or improve brain scanning.
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:58.440]   It's also great that we have just like people
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:35:59.440]   improving cryonics.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:01.240]   So like we could just like, you know,
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:04.040]   go to sleep in the freezer and eventually,
[02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:06.560]   hopefully sometime in the future, you know,
[02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:09.480]   how Finny is gonna be able to wake up all of this.
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:14.240]   You know, anyone who gets cryochronically frozen today
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:15.880]   will be able to wake up, but you know,
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:17.200]   that's a bet, right?
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.600]   That's the last resort.
[02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:20.280]   And then the other interesting thing
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:23.920]   about the like extreme uploading approach, right?
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:27.200]   Is like, we're excited about space
[02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:32.200]   and one of the points that a lot of science
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:34.640]   or like hard science fiction types make is that,
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:35.920]   you know, if you wanna explore space,
[02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:38.320]   that's a lot easier if you're not a human, right?
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:40.720]   Like one example of this is that, you know,
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:42.840]   in the context of humans, we're talking about like,
[02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:44.240]   oh, we're gonna be able to go to the moon
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:46.080]   or we're gonna be able to go to Mars,
[02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:49.480]   but there's this project called Starshot, I believe, right?
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:52.800]   That's basically trying to send spacecrafts
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:55.160]   to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri.
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:58.120]   And they literally believe that they're going to be able
[02:36:58.120 --> 02:36:59.960]   to get spacecraft over to Alpha Centauri
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.360]   like four light years away by like the 2060s.
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:04.200]   Now, I mean-
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:05.480]   - By traveling close to the speed of light, yeah.
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:08.200]   - Exactly, like, so the way it works is, you know,
[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:09.240]   you have these light sails,
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:10.920]   like you basically take these as a spacecraft
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:13.880]   and you shine a laser at it and the laser is insanely strong,
[02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:17.000]   quickly accelerated at a hundred Gs,
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.720]   no, I think it was 10,000 Gs
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:20.840]   until it gets to 20% of the speed of light.
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.880]   And then, you know, it goes on your merry way, right?
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:27.480]   So if you want to be in, like,
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:30.080]   personally explore the Alpha Centauri system
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.560]   within like two centuries or one century,
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:37.480]   then, you know, being a robot is like
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:39.320]   by far the most practical way to do it
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.800]   'cause there's no way that a human being
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:42.440]   can survive 10,000 Gs.
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:45.160]   So it's definitely interesting long-term,
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:47.240]   but at the same time,
[02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:50.040]   there's definitely a lot of like psychological hangups
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:52.040]   and a lot of like deep philosophy
[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:55.640]   that we'll just have to grapple with to get there.
[02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:57.920]   - I think what it hangs on the topic
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:59.880]   of whether we can convert consciousness
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:01.360]   into an engineering problem.
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:05.160]   So like, is consciousness tied to our biology?
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.720]   Because the moment we can convert consciousness
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:09.080]   into a digital form,
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.840]   then we can send it with that light sail
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:12.800]   to Alpha Centauri.
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:16.360]   Until then, a robot is not carrying anything
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:18.560]   except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia.
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:21.600]   It's not carrying the flame of human consciousness.
[02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:25.600]   I have high hopes for converting consciousness
[02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:27.520]   into an engineering problem.
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.200]   In fact, I think it's not as difficult as people think.
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.560]   - I agree with that.
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:33.920]   I'm definitely in the camp that consciousness
[02:38:33.920 --> 02:38:35.920]   is a property of the algorithm
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.680]   and not a property of brain structure.
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:41.520]   The other fun, like the kinds of philosophical things
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:43.680]   we'd have to grapple with is like,
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:46.160]   once you upload yourself, like you can hit Control + C.
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:48.480]   You know, like it wouldn't be lovely
[02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:50.760]   to have like 10 copies of a little experiment
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:53.400]   and then like we could just interview everyone.
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:54.800]   - So this is, I mean, this is,
[02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:56.200]   I have to ask this question.
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:58.480]   It's a difficult one, which,
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:00.800]   I don't think it'd be wonderful, first of all.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.560]   - Sure.
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:04.320]   - So in the following way,
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:06.360]   and this has to do with immortality as well,
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:11.360]   there's something about scarcity that creates value.
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:13.400]   Or there's a bunch of philosophers,
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:16.280]   Viktor Frankl, Bernard Williams, Ernest Becker,
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:20.200]   they argue that death or the scarcity of life
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:21.400]   creates meaning.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:24.440]   The reason we, life is beautiful,
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:27.680]   the reason so many moments of experience
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:31.640]   of love or delicious food,
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:34.480]   all those things are made delicious
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:36.920]   because they're finite, because they end,
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:39.680]   and because we don't have that many of them.
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:41.540]   And there's a kind of worry that
[02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:43.800]   if we extend the human lifespan,
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:45.520]   if we achieve immortality,
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.160]   or if we, God forbid, clone me,
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:52.920]   multiple times, then you lose the richness
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:55.320]   of what it means to have this life,
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:57.000]   to have this experience.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.480]   Is that worry you at all?
[02:39:58.480 --> 02:40:00.320]   Do you think there's some aspect to which
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.840]   death does in fact give meaning to life?
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:05.480]   - I guess the one historical parallel,
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:06.960]   and this might be a bit unfair,
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:09.120]   is that there have been philosophers
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:11.360]   that have said things like,
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:14.520]   war gives meaning to human collectives,
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.800]   and the struggle for supremacy
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.840]   between nations and races
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:21.040]   is this big driver of progress
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.200]   that ensures that everyone strives to be their best.
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:28.840]   And of course, this viewpoint got into the head
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:30.000]   of a crazy Austrian guy,
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.440]   and 20 years later, his soldiers
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:33.240]   were shooting at my grandparents.
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:36.880]   So, these days we don't really have that,
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:39.460]   but yet life still feels meaningful.
[02:40:39.460 --> 02:40:41.320]   We've still found other ways to,
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:47.160]   there's still a striving for technological progress,
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:52.160]   there's still a striving for self-improvement in general,
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.320]   and it turns out that you don't actually need
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:58.760]   to have existential conflicts in order to have that.
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:40:59.880]   Now, maybe you need conflict,
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.280]   but we have other kinds of conflict, right?
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:03.680]   Like we have competition between businesses,
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:05.420]   competition between political ideologies,
[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:07.560]   competition between projects.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:09.400]   And so, these are,
[02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:12.720]   whatever the psychological needs are,
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:14.520]   they're just our substitutes for it.
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:17.240]   So, I guess, yeah, so if we,
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:21.920]   trying to say, I feel like once we start living
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:26.920]   to the age of 200, then I'm just intuitively expecting
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:30.800]   that we'll see substitutes emerge in the same way.
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:35.700]   - Yeah, we'll create conflicts of other sorts
[02:41:35.700 --> 02:41:38.880]   that lead to less human suffering than wars do.
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:42.440]   Like we'll just start playing Diablo 4, 5, 6,
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:44.200]   'cause you die in video games.
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:48.440]   So, maybe we'll get some of the inkling of scarcity
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:50.400]   through the activities we partake in
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.400]   as opposed to our own body dying.
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:54.080]   I mean, I feel shitty when I,
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:00.320]   I remember in Diablo 3, you can play in hardcore mode,
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.080]   where if you die in the game, your character's dead.
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:07.440]   So, maybe we'll get the richness of,
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:09.520]   like that we currently get from life
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:12.960]   by having little artificial versions of ourselves that die.
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:15.760]   Interestingly enough, as I've just personally
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:17.120]   spent more time in this world,
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:19.520]   I've started realizing that there is a concept
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:23.880]   of real finiteness that still exists,
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:25.880]   and it might even still be a thing that provides meaning
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:28.160]   that doesn't require anyone to actually die.
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.160]   Like, for example, how many people from middle school
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:34.920]   or even high school, yours,
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:36.640]   do you still talk to regularly?
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:39.560]   - I happen to be close friends with four or five of them.
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:41.440]   - Okay, well, in my case, the answer is zero
[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:43.000]   for middle school and two for high school.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:43.840]   - But you're right.
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:44.680]   - Right.
[02:42:44.680 --> 02:42:45.520]   - It dropped.
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:46.360]   - Exactly, it dropped a lot.
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:47.200]   - Close to zero.
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.480]   - And so, there's a lot of these just,
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:52.600]   like relationships that end up being very finite.
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:54.800]   A person changes their,
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:57.160]   I feel like a person changes enough of their worldview
[02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:58.200]   after 25 years.
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:42:59.600]   Was there even a study about this?
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.080]   Something like a person and themselves 25 years later
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:06.640]   are about as different as like two different people
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:08.000]   or something like this.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.880]   So, yeah, like I mean, just like you can have conflict
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:11.720]   without bloodshed.
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:14.760]   I think you can have finiteness
[02:43:14.760 --> 02:43:18.520]   and even the necessary sorrows of finiteness
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:20.760]   that give meaning without like literally
[02:43:20.760 --> 02:43:22.760]   anyone having to end their life.
[02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:24.640]   - And hopefully, if we do extend our life,
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:27.920]   we'll figure out ways to extend the period of time
[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:30.280]   where there's neuroplasticity
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:33.160]   to where we could change our worldviews
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:34.740]   continually throughout that time
[02:43:34.740 --> 02:43:37.600]   so you can have these different phases of life.
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:41.800]   - I thought it would be fun to hear you speak a little Russian.
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:43.200]   - Yes, of course.
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:47.280]   - How did your Russian roots help you?
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:50.520]   - That's an interesting question.
[02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:52.600]   - What can you say in Russian about that?
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:55.760]   - What can I say about my Russian roots?
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:44:00.760]   When I just look at other projects,
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:07.800]   other people in the blockchain industry,
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:12.560]   sometimes when I just look at what Russian people do,
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.320]   what other people do,
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:19.320]   I can sometimes feel that these people
[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:21.760]   who are Russian,
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:26.760]   there's something that feels like me,
[02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:31.280]   but I don't know how to explain it.
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:33.320]   - You think there's,
[02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:35.640]   so for people who don't speak Russian,
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:40.240]   that Vitalik said that there is something
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:42.240]   to the spirit of the people that are Russian
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:44.960]   that are working in the cryptocurrency world
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:46.800]   that's a little bit different
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.160]   and it's something that connects
[02:44:50.160 --> 02:44:53.080]   to some kind of aspect of your own self,
[02:44:53.080 --> 02:44:54.480]   some kind of roots there.
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:56.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:58.440]   Do you think that there's,
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:01.640]   does it make you sad that there's these two different worlds
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:06.640]   that are sort of in part disconnected by language?
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:09.840]   And I'm sure the same could be the case with China
[02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:11.680]   and other parts of the world,
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:16.480]   where the language slows the transmission
[02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:18.240]   of the beauty of the culture
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:21.400]   in a certain kind of way where you can't truly collaborate.
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:23.200]   Like you can all speak English,
[02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:25.840]   you're collaborating on maybe a technical level,
[02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:28.400]   but you're not collaborating on the level
[02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.680]   of some deep human connection.
[02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:34.160]   Do you see that being able to speak both languages?
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:35.880]   - There's definitely benefits, I think,
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:39.000]   to be able to speak multiple languages.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:40.680]   And once you can, right?
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:45.000]   You discover that even your mindset changes
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.520]   while you're speaking in one language versus the other.
[02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:48.640]   Like people have told me this,
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.280]   like when I speak Russian, I sound more like,
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:54.400]   I guess like to the point and pragmatic.
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:56.440]   When I speak Chinese, I sound more cute.
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:45:59.160]   When I speak English, I'm something else.
[02:45:59.160 --> 02:46:05.960]   I guess there's definitely like a richness
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:08.280]   that you're missing if you're only
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:10.560]   in one of these language bubbles,
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:14.960]   but I guess the arguments on the other side would be that,
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:16.560]   if everyone spoke the same language,
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:19.560]   then like there would just be one bubble, right?
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:21.160]   This is the challenge, I think.
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:24.400]   Like if there are actually benefits
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:25.680]   to having cultural diversity
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:27.600]   and you definitely don't want the entire world
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:29.040]   to be too conformist.
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:31.800]   And well, one of the interesting things about crypto
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:34.800]   is that it's just a culture that actually like manages
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:37.920]   to somehow have its uniqueness
[02:46:37.920 --> 02:46:40.200]   and even preserve its independence
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:43.000]   from all of these surrounding countries,
[02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000]   despite being embedded in all of them.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.800]   - So it spans outside of the geographic boundaries
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:51.040]   and language in some ways does as well.
[02:46:51.040 --> 02:46:54.560]   And the way these cultures, these bubbles are created,
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:56.360]   I mean, they overlap in interesting ways.
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:57.480]   It's almost like a hierarchy
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:00.040]   and the same as the case of the crypto world.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:03.520]   There's communities associated with each cryptocurrencies,
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:06.880]   there's communities within those communities and it's-
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:08.520]   - Yeah, I mean, I think like,
[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:10.320]   it's definitely sad whenever these groups
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.520]   are fighting each other.
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.160]   And like, it's definitely good for them to,
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:19.720]   like if people can cooperate more,
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:21.200]   but at the same time,
[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.480]   like just having like groups of people
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:27.200]   that have different kinds of life experiences,
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:30.280]   like there's definitely something to benefit from that.
[02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:32.000]   - So let me ask one last question.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.840]   I don't think I asked you last time,
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:36.320]   the ridiculous question about the meaning of life.
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:40.200]   Dostoevsky said, "Beauty will save the world."
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:43.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:46.840]   Some people believe money is a big part of happiness
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:50.360]   and you've turned, first of all, you've made a lot of money,
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.920]   you turned away a lot of money,
[02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:53.940]   you turned away a lot of power.
[02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:56.320]   So you're a fascinating person to ask,
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:58.320]   what do you think is meaning to life?
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:01.360]   - The thing that I've realized with money
[02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:05.560]   as I have experienced both having a little of it
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.560]   and having a lot of it is that the benefit of,
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:15.640]   you can get the most out of money if you think of it,
[02:48:15.640 --> 02:48:18.840]   not as something that like lets you do and have more things,
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:22.200]   but as something that lets you worry about fewer things.
[02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:28.400]   If your savings are just non-zero at all,
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:31.360]   then you don't have to worry as much about losing your job.
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:35.160]   And if you feel like you have a job
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:37.000]   that just like really conflicts with your values,
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.120]   then if you have even six months saved up,
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:40.520]   that just makes it easier for you to say,
[02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:42.720]   bye-bye, I'm going to do something else.
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:47.720]   If you have more money, then you can not worry
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:51.560]   about even what you're doing
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:53.800]   needing to be profitable at all.
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:55.000]   Once you get more money,
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.320]   then you can choose transportation options
[02:48:59.320 --> 02:49:02.520]   and food options that just have less hassle in your life
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:04.360]   and allow you to be lazier.
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.360]   So this aspect of just reducing troubles
[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:14.280]   and opening up room for other things,
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:16.400]   I think is a big part of it.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:20.240]   If you instead think of money as being this positive
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:22.480]   or this thing that gives you stuff
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:25.840]   and you try to derive meaning from the stuff,
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:29.280]   I think that's much more likely to be a road
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.320]   to basically squandering that opportunity.
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:35.200]   So, yeah, and I guess my philosophy on that
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:38.480]   is definitely more subtractive than additive there.
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:39.960]   - But once you have enough money
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:41.720]   that you don't have to worry about the money,
[02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:45.080]   you're burdened with another question, which is of meaning.
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:48.000]   I mean, do you think there's meaning to it all?
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.800]   Or it seems like your own life,
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:54.920]   you're trying to build cool stuff
[02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:59.360]   that alleviates some level of suffering in the world.
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:02.000]   - Well, I mean, one way to think about it is like,
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:05.160]   think back to how you thought about life
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:06.680]   when you were in school.
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:09.080]   In school, it's interesting to think about,
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:11.000]   because in a lot of ways,
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.000]   it's just totally outside of bounds
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.400]   of the kinds of systems that are,
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:19.560]   like social systems that we live in as adults,
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:21.640]   or maybe not, like maybe things like academia
[02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:23.840]   are intended to replicate parts of school.
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:25.960]   First of all, school is very totalitarian.
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:30.600]   You have to follow the teacher's instructions,
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:32.520]   the bulk of your schedule is like forced
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:33.920]   to be in particular areas.
[02:50:33.920 --> 02:50:36.080]   And we can control
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:41.240]   real you from leaving the grounds
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:43.960]   during this period of time,
[02:50:43.960 --> 02:50:45.280]   assign a lot of homework.
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:47.080]   But at the same time, also,
[02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:50.320]   school is a bit of a post-scarcity utopia
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:51.680]   in that you just don't have to worry
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:53.640]   about getting resources for yourself.
[02:50:53.640 --> 02:50:57.800]   And we've both lived through 12 years of that.
[02:50:57.800 --> 02:50:59.680]   So, what does that say about us?
[02:50:59.680 --> 02:51:01.880]   And I think, like,
[02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:04.320]   in one thing of aspect, obviously,
[02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:05.720]   is that in,
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:09.960]   it does, like, there's definitely an easiness
[02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:13.040]   to living life if all of your decisions are made for you.
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:17.760]   And one of the challenges of adulthood, I guess,
[02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:21.840]   is moving to this world where all your choices
[02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:23.040]   are much more self-directed,
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:27.000]   and you just have to learn to live and deal with that.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.440]   - Yeah, dealing with the burden of freedom.
[02:51:29.440 --> 02:51:30.840]   - Yeah. - Makes some sense.
[02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:34.400]   - Actually interesting, because,
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:38.880]   in some ways, I feel like even my first five years
[02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:41.440]   of doing Ethereum things,
[02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:43.480]   my life was not even all that self-directed
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:47.480]   because a lot of it was just responding to obligations.
[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:49.480]   Like, someone said, "Oh, come to speak
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:51.120]   "at this event in Korea."
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:53.000]   Okay, "Come to speak at this thing in Taiwan."
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:57.040]   Okay, "Oh, for Ethereum to launch,
[02:51:57.040 --> 02:52:00.840]   "we need this particular piece to be done and tested."
[02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:01.760]   Okay, "Work on that."
[02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:04.800]   Right, "We need a proof-of-stake algorithm.
[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:05.800]   "Work on that."
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.760]   And the last year of COVID life,
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:13.520]   like, basically, I was holed up in Singapore
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:14.400]   for much of it, right?
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:16.560]   And it gave me a lot more alone time.
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:18.160]   You know, I had much less travel.
[02:52:18.160 --> 02:52:19.760]   And that was definitely a very new
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:21.560]   and interesting experience for me.
[02:52:21.560 --> 02:52:25.000]   - Would you characterize it by sadness,
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:30.000]   melancholy, hope, dreaming, like, innovative period?
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:33.320]   Like, how would you characterize that alone time?
[02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:34.680]   - Some of all five.
[02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:36.520]   Definitely some self-discovery.
[02:52:36.520 --> 02:52:40.120]   I definitely did, like, take this,
[02:52:40.120 --> 02:52:42.200]   make this very deliberate decision that, like,
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:46.120]   okay, I have this time and I'm going to, like,
[02:52:46.120 --> 02:52:48.920]   actually make something meaningful out of it.
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:50.880]   So, like, one example of the things I did
[02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:54.560]   is I just, like, actually started listening
[02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:57.480]   to audio books and podcasts much more.
[02:52:57.480 --> 02:53:00.440]   Like, just this year, I basically kind of discovered
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:03.560]   that the podcast space is real for the first time, I guess.
[02:53:03.560 --> 02:53:04.640]   Like, before that, you know,
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:06.360]   there would be things that I would get interviewed for,
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:11.000]   but I was not really kind of, like, mentally incorporated.
[02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.200]   I did not mentally incorporate this idea
[02:53:13.200 --> 02:53:14.960]   that, like, podcasts are a thing
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:16.320]   that you can go listen to.
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:19.760]   And this year I did, like, my friend,
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:22.920]   Carl LaFleur, one of the optimism people,
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:24.480]   recommended Hardcore History to me.
[02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:26.000]   And so I went ahead and I just listened
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.680]   to all the hardcore histories.
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:29.720]   And then after that, you know,
[02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:31.560]   listened to, like, Ted Luxfried bids
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:33.040]   and then a bunch of others.
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:37.080]   And after that, I also got into audio books.
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:40.560]   Oh, I listened to the entire,
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:42.120]   the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,
[02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:44.640]   the whole thing, 45 hours.
[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:45.760]   That was fascinating.
[02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:47.240]   - So what, let me ask about that,
[02:53:47.240 --> 02:53:48.720]   'cause Dana's going to love hearing this.
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:50.520]   I'm going to tell him to tell.
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:52.960]   Do you have a period of history,
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:54.960]   whether it's Dan or in general,
[02:53:54.960 --> 02:53:57.040]   that you draw for your own life,
[02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:58.760]   like, kind of thinking about the world,
[02:53:58.760 --> 02:54:00.600]   about human nature that you go to?
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:01.800]   Is it World War II?
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:06.080]   Is it Wrath of the Khans, the Genghis Khan?
[02:54:06.080 --> 02:54:09.140]   Is it some other more ancient history?
[02:54:09.140 --> 02:54:10.360]   Is it World War I?
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.680]   Is there something that kind of echoes with you
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:17.240]   in the voice of Dan or anyone else that you connect to?
[02:54:17.240 --> 02:54:20.160]   - I feel like the 1930s and '40s are fascinating
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:22.120]   because they force you to really grapple
[02:54:22.120 --> 02:54:26.560]   with the question of where does evil come from?
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:30.240]   The sort of mental puzzle that I've always had in my head
[02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:34.960]   is on the one hand, things like the Holocaust happened,
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:36.440]   but on the other hand,
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:39.360]   if you just go and have a coffee with people,
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:42.640]   then 100 times out of 100, everyone just seems so nice.
[02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:44.960]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:47.160]   - Yeah, how do you kind of reconcile
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:49.040]   the macro and the micro there?
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:53.200]   And that's the sort of thing that's very difficult
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:58.200]   if you don't have a lot of, I guess,
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.320]   the right kind of personal experience,
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:02.140]   like, especially if your personal experience
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:04.560]   starts off being sheltered, like it was for me, right?
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:06.560]   Like, I know the stereotype
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:08.120]   is that the nerds get bullied in school,
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:10.560]   but like, actually for me, in my school experience,
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:12.880]   was just being treated with kindness by everyone.
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:17.260]   And so that definitely made it harder to understand things.
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:19.760]   I remember actually being pretty blindsided
[02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.400]   when I started Ethereum, and then within six months,
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.280]   there started being fights over like,
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:25.880]   who would get more shares
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:27.800]   if Ethereum turned out to be a company.
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.560]   And then I suggested we should just make it be a nonprofit,
[02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:32.660]   and somehow that ended up upsetting people.
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:38.600]   So the fascinating thing for me is that,
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:40.040]   like I've been, you know,
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:42.080]   obviously reading and listening to the history,
[02:55:42.080 --> 02:55:43.080]   and then at the same time,
[02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:46.920]   just like observing things happening in the crypto space.
[02:55:46.920 --> 02:55:50.580]   And so one of my interesting,
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:52.740]   like mental intuitions that I've gotten
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:56.900]   is that I think like most evil doesn't come out of greed,
[02:55:56.900 --> 02:55:58.740]   it comes out of fear.
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:03.740]   And like one example of this in Ethereum lands, right,
[02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:08.340]   is like, I think the part of Ethereum history
[02:56:08.340 --> 02:56:09.820]   where I thought that the Ethereum community
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:10.660]   was at its lowest,
[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.740]   and even when I personally was at my lowest,
[02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:16.540]   I mean, if you go back to the Dow fork in 2016, right?
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:17.980]   So, you know, the Dow hack happens,
[02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:19.580]   and then we made this controversial decision
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:22.020]   to change the Ethereum protocol.
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:25.860]   And we, you know,
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:28.300]   then there was that Ethereum Classic split.
[02:56:28.300 --> 02:56:32.540]   And as soon as that Ethereum Classic split happened,
[02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:34.980]   you know, there was like a lot of anger everywhere.
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:38.340]   And there started especially being anger
[02:56:38.340 --> 02:56:41.540]   when the price of ETC started like taking up, right?
[02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:45.340]   So this was the time when Ether started off being $13,
[02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:46.980]   and Ethereum Classic started at zero,
[02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:48.940]   but then suddenly there was this one day
[02:56:48.940 --> 02:56:50.980]   when like ETH dropped to 12.5,
[02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:53.420]   ETC went up to 0.5,
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:55.300]   and then they dropped more.
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:58.140]   And people were saying things like, you know,
[02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.660]   oh, this whole thing,
[02:56:59.660 --> 02:57:02.700]   Ethereum Classic is just a like a sign up by,
[02:57:02.700 --> 02:57:04.100]   you know, the Bitcoin community
[02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:06.980]   and just the wealthy Bitcoiners trying to destroy Ethereum.
[02:57:06.980 --> 02:57:08.980]   And like in the back of my mind,
[02:57:08.980 --> 02:57:11.060]   I knew that that wasn't entirely true.
[02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:12.620]   Like there were definitely were Bitcoiners,
[02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:13.660]   but at the same time,
[02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:16.980]   like I think blaming political,
[02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:19.580]   like internal or blaming disagreements
[02:57:19.580 --> 02:57:20.980]   on foreign interference, right?
[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:22.460]   Like this is the sort of thing that, you know,
[02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:25.660]   like countries, governments do all the time.
[02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:28.540]   Like it's a very convenient excuse, right?
[02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:31.460]   Because it allows you to just like blame these things
[02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:32.860]   that are happening on the foreigners
[02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:36.580]   and avoid actually grappling with the facts that like,
[02:57:36.580 --> 02:57:37.980]   well, no, actually you have people
[02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:40.340]   in your very own community who just disagree with you
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:41.780]   and have a different belief.
[02:57:41.780 --> 02:57:44.060]   And I think, you know,
[02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:45.380]   I feel like the Ethereum community,
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:48.180]   like during that time did not do a very good job
[02:57:48.180 --> 02:57:49.020]   of grappling with that.
[02:57:49.020 --> 02:57:50.700]   And I feel like I during that time
[02:57:50.700 --> 02:57:53.020]   did not do a very good job of grappling with that.
[02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:56.220]   And so there was a lot of like blaming the Bitcoiners.
[02:57:56.220 --> 02:57:59.140]   There were also even a lot of people calling for us
[02:57:59.140 --> 02:58:02.540]   to use trademark law and like basically sue exchanges
[02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:05.820]   and like try to prevent them from listing Ethereum Classic.
[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:07.620]   And like, to me, that was very unethical, right?
[02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:08.460]   Like this,
[02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:14.260]   like basically using the government as a weapon
[02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:17.260]   to try to attack the other cryptocurrency
[02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:20.220]   and like destroy it as like goes completely against them,
[02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:21.900]   you know, the ideals of freedom and, you know,
[02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:23.940]   like things that at least in theory
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:25.700]   we're supposed to stand for.
[02:58:25.700 --> 02:58:28.980]   But, you know, like in that particular time,
[02:58:28.980 --> 02:58:31.380]   like basically what was happening was that, you know,
[02:58:31.380 --> 02:58:33.620]   the ETC price was rising and at the same time,
[02:58:33.620 --> 02:58:36.140]   the ETH price was dropping in lockstep.
[02:58:36.140 --> 02:58:39.060]   And there were a lot of Bitcoin people basically saying,
[02:58:39.060 --> 02:58:40.340]   "This is the end of Ethereum."
[02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:42.340]   And I think a lot of people really were afraid
[02:58:42.340 --> 02:58:45.060]   that Ethereum would be just like completely destroyed
[02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:46.100]   or as a result of this.
[02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:47.860]   And so like--
[02:58:47.860 --> 02:58:48.860]   - That's where the anger came from.
[02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:50.460]   - Exactly, that's, yeah, exactly.
[02:58:50.460 --> 02:58:53.580]   It came from the fear and like that's what I like
[02:58:53.580 --> 02:58:55.340]   allowed people to rationalize
[02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:57.100]   like in abandonment of principles
[02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:59.580]   that I think they would not have accepted
[02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:01.860]   in other circumstances.
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:05.540]   And I definitely, like to some extent,
[02:59:05.540 --> 02:59:06.980]   played along with this myself, right?
[02:59:06.980 --> 02:59:10.220]   And I do definitely regret that to some extent.
[02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:14.820]   Well, I definitely regret like the excesses completely.
[02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:18.620]   But so that, and then obviously, you know,
[02:59:18.620 --> 02:59:21.660]   Bitcoin block size war, similar sort of stuff happens.
[02:59:21.660 --> 02:59:26.660]   So like that insight was interesting
[02:59:26.660 --> 02:59:30.700]   because like it does mentally make a lot of sense, right?
[02:59:30.700 --> 02:59:33.060]   Like when you're actually afraid that, you know,
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:34.820]   unless you act in some way that, you know,
[02:59:34.820 --> 02:59:36.300]   your entire world is going to collapse.
[02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:38.980]   Like it's much easier to just rationalize, you know,
[02:59:38.980 --> 02:59:41.060]   forgetting your principles and doing whatever you have to
[02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:44.260]   to just save the specific thing that you care about.
[02:59:44.260 --> 02:59:47.020]   - It feels like the right thing to do,
[02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:51.820]   the brave thing to do is in the face of fear
[02:59:51.820 --> 02:59:54.620]   to still have compassion, to still have love
[02:59:54.620 --> 02:59:56.940]   as opposed to hate.
[02:59:56.940 --> 03:00:00.780]   So the darkest moments, the toughest moments
[03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:04.820]   of human history are those where fear is everywhere.
[03:00:04.820 --> 03:00:09.820]   And despite that, like the way to get out of that
[03:00:09.820 --> 03:00:15.020]   is through love, not giving into the fear.
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:17.540]   And again, that's the lesson that you draw
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:19.240]   from all those moments of history.
[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:24.740]   Yeah, well, I like you have in terms of those coffee
[03:00:24.740 --> 03:00:26.180]   and the kindness that people have,
[03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:29.500]   it does seem that everybody has the capacity for evil
[03:00:29.500 --> 03:00:31.580]   and everybody has the capacity for love
[03:00:31.580 --> 03:00:35.220]   and you just have to create mechanisms and incentives
[03:00:35.220 --> 03:00:38.580]   that prioritize the latter over the former.
[03:00:38.580 --> 03:00:41.300]   But Alec, you're one of the most interesting people
[03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:42.900]   I've gotten a chance to talk to.
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:45.540]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:47.660]   I hope we get a chance to talk again.
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:50.540]   I hope I can at least be as some small part,
[03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:53.540]   this would be awesome in a podcast with you and Dan Carlin.
[03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:55.440]   That would be an awesome conversation.
[03:00:55.440 --> 03:00:59.460]   Thank you so much for doing so much
[03:00:59.460 --> 03:01:01.940]   incredible technical innovation
[03:01:01.940 --> 03:01:04.900]   that inspires the computer scientists,
[03:01:04.900 --> 03:01:07.140]   the economists, inspires the world
[03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:08.980]   and what technology can do.
[03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:13.980]   And now with longevity, I do hope we live a very long time
[03:01:13.980 --> 03:01:19.740]   and play Diablo to make that long time fun.
[03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:21.020]   Thank you so much for talking to me.
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:23.500]   - Thank you too, Alexis, it was great.
[03:01:23.500 --> 03:01:25.020]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation

[03:01:35.940 --> 03:01:38.820]   And now let me leave you with some words
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:40.940]   from Nelson Mandela.
[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:43.420]   "When a man is denied the right to live the life
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:48.420]   "he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw."
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:51.860]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:01:54.440]   (upbeat music)
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:57.020]   (upbeat music)
