[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.120]   We live in the age of life hacking, the art of accumulating tricks and
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.240]   skills to increase our personal productivity.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.440]   And many of us have heard tips from life hackers and
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.480]   many of us want to be life hackers ourselves.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.000]   We're drawn to anything that promises to shortcut our work or
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.480]   to make our communication more accurate and efficient or
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.080]   to help us remember and recall information at just the right time in life.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.200]   The goal of life hacking is productivity.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.440]   So we mark off little areas of our life or little behaviors and
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.520]   we reduce them to certain actions.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.200]   Actions that can be sped up and simplified and improved by new techniques.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.440]   Around the promises of these new practices has arisen a whole industry of
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.880]   life hacking websites and podcasts and best selling books and of course,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.920]   bushels and bushels of smartphone apps.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.880]   Rising in the ranks of all stars in the field of life hacking are people like
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.320]   Tim Ferriss, a man who willingly offers himself up as a personal guinea pig as he
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680]   calls himself.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.560]   Ferriss tests an incredibly varied mix of modifications to the patterns and
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   rituals of our everyday lives.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.840]   And his books and podcasts are endlessly interesting as he discovers newer and
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.800]   better ways to eat and sleep and work and work out.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.200]   Along the way, he has adopted the best of the vivid,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.000]   pragmatic knowledge of the old stoic philosophers into his own philosophy of
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.120]   life, but he takes the Stoics with one key modification.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.160]   He intentionally leaves behind the theology of the Stoics.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   In the life hacking age, you can do such a thing.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920]   You can drop God out of your life equation altogether.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.440]   And on the surface, decluttering the divine will lead to no noticeable loss to
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.000]   the bottom line of personal productivity.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.800]   But this discrepancy also exposes the most toxic flaw of life hacking.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.640]   We can hack away to save time and at the same time lose our way along the path of
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.760]   life.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.280]   We grow more and more proficient with our daily routines, but we grow less and
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.600]   less clear of the ultimate purpose and ends of our lives inside God's creation.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   It's too easy to hack wonder and devotion and God-centered delight and
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.880]   glory right out of our lives.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.440]   This is when life hacking goes wrong.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.280]   Enter Benjamin Franklin.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   Franklin is perhaps the most famous life hacker of the 18th century.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.680]   He is both a fascinating example of life hacking at its finest and he is a
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.440]   prominent example of life hacking gone wrong.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.800]   To get the story, I connected with author and Baylor historian Tommy Kidd, who
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.920]   recently finished writing an excellent book titled Benjamin Franklin, the
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.080]   Religious Life of a Founding Father, which is due out in May of 2017 from
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   Yale.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520]   Kidd is also the author of George Whitefield, America's Spiritual Founding
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.240]   Father, published by Yale in 2014, and more recently, American Colonial History,
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.880]   Clashing Cultures and Faiths, published by Yale this year.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.000]   To begin our 45-minute conversation, I asked Kidd for a brief biographical
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.320]   overview of Benjamin Franklin's life and his accomplishments.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.520]   Here's what he said.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.920]   Well, he's really truly a remarkable person.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.760]   I mean, at so many levels.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.360]   I mean, he's a great inventor and scientist.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.080]   He is one of the great innovators in the printing industry.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.040]   He's a critical diplomat for the American colonies and then the newly independent
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.640]   United States, and I think is rightly seen as a true American genius and world
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.960]   genius scientifically and in all of his innovations along the lines of, you know,
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.080]   maybe like an Einstein or a Steve Jobs in a more contemporary world.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.520]   You know, I knew all that going into writing this book, but I was sort of
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   freshly blown away by what a Renaissance man he is, and I think is just gifted by
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.520]   God, I believe, uniquely with all these natural gifts to discover and innovate.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.760]   He's just an incredible person, and because he lives for such a long time into his
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.880]   80s, which in the 18th century is an awfully long time to live, he's able to do just
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   amazing things coming out of a pretty humble background.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.440]   So I really don't think that you can overstate the importance of Benjamin Franklin
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   in American and in European history.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.840]   No, certainly not.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.000]   He is from a fairly humble background, in fact.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   In his rise in the world, how far low did he begin, how far up did he rise?
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.120]   Yeah, well, he grew up in a modest Puritan family in Boston.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.760]   They came to--his father came to Boston in the late 17th century, and Ben Franklin
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.120]   is born in the early 1700s, and just a--you know, tradespeople, regular folks in
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.400]   Boston, not elite at all.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.680]   They did have some thoughts because they knew that Benjamin Franklin was brilliant.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.200]   That was easy to see in him as a boy, and so they thought maybe they would send him
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:30.060]   to Harvard College, but Harvard was at that time in the early 1700s almost exclusively
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.400]   a school for training pastors.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.040]   And I think they also--his parents also started to realize maybe by his early teens that he
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.600]   was developing some skepticism about traditional faith, and I think that may have played a
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   role in them scuttling the plans for him to go to Harvard.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.320]   And so he had very limited formal education and didn't go to college, like many of the
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.680]   founding fathers in America that never went to college.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.880]   But that doesn't mean he wasn't educated.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.560]   I mean, he was deeply educated and literate and a voracious reader.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.840]   I think his parents certainly wanted him to read the Bible, and he did that a lot.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.680]   One of the things we see about Franklin is that even though he had some skepticism about
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.440]   traditional Christian doctrine, it is not because he was ignorant about the Bible.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.600]   He knew the Bible backwards and forwards, had learned it in his home growing up, and
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.480]   then just read everything he could get his hands on as a teenager and a young man.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.560]   That's part of the reason why he went into the printing business is because he liked
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.520]   the idea of being able to have access to a lot more books for free.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   And so that's how he became a printer's apprentice.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.180]   First he was an apprentice to his older brother in Boston, and then they had a falling out
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:01.880]   and he ended up running away from his brother's print shop and going from Boston to Philadelphia.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.480]   But in those years as a teenager, he actually was working as an indentured servant, which
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.280]   is a kind of a temporary slave basically in those days.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   So he had a pretty rough upbringing by our standards, even though he came from a very
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.040]   serious Christian family.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.200]   >>Steve: That's pretty rough.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.160]   So how unlikely is his story?
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.640]   >>Dr. Mildner: It wasn't totally unprecedented, although Franklin's story is quite unusual,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   and I think it has to do with, again, his natural gifts, God-given gifts in entrepreneurship
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.480]   and invention.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.440]   I think among the other founders, you know, Alexander Hamilton has a little bit of a story
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.840]   like that comes from a much more difficult family situation, born to unmarried parents
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.200]   in the Caribbean.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   And then, you know, a pastor and some other sponsors take an interest in Hamilton and
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.480]   manage for him to be able to go to King's College in New York City that later became
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   Columbia.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.620]   So, I mean, if you make the right contacts and you're able to do work hard and depend
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:22.120]   on your innate brilliance, I think that that story, at least among whites, I mean, it's
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.600]   very, very difficult if you're African-American or Native American to make those kind of advances
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.000]   in that period.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.080]   But I mean, America, they talk about America and especially Pennsylvania as being the best
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.240]   poor man's country in the 18th century.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.680]   And I think there is a little bit more of an opportunity for social advancements because
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.960]   you don't have that entrenched aristocracy in America the same way you do, for instance,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   in England.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.680]   Lewis: Franklin takes good advantage of his opportunities.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.280]   Fast forward to the end of his life.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.000]   At the time of his death, what would have been said of him?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.600]   What were maybe the top four achievements of Franklin's lifetime?
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.320]   Richard: I think his innovations as a printer.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:17.360]   He is easily the most successful printer in America in the 1730s and '40s, so much so
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.640]   that he's able to retire from printing very early because he's made a fortune.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:30.280]   Then his scientific experiments, in particular his experiments in electricity and the nature
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.360]   of lightning.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.000]   He's most famous for this experiment that he did where he flew a kite into a thunderstorm
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.440]   and was able to draw off an electrical charge from the electrified kite string.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:51.160]   That experiment is not only a part of American scientific lore and so forth, but it really
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:59.200]   did draw international attention for him, so much so that he won the Copley Medal from
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.640]   the Royal Society in England, which was kind of the equivalent of winning the Nobel Prize
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.640]   at the time.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.400]   It was just a huge deal.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.840]   So he really, as kind of a side project almost, he made these incredible scientific discoveries
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.480]   in electricity.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.360]   He got awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.600]   After that point, he was always called Dr. Franklin.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.320]   That's where that name came from.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.600]   Then finally, certainly his diplomatic work.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   He spent most of the second half of his life either in England or in France as a diplomat.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:47.520]   The great success there was his negotiation of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which brought
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.560]   an end to the American Revolution and granted the new American nation its independence on
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.960]   very favorable terms for the American nation.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.880]   In a lot of ways, I think the Treaty of Paris is still considered the greatest diplomatic
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.080]   achievement in all of American history.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.720]   He wasn't the only one working on that, but he was probably the lead diplomat for America.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.440]   It's just stunning that any one person would have these kinds of accomplishments in a single
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   lifetime.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.400]   >>Joseph: So Franklin grew up in a Puritan home.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.680]   He was familiar with the Bible, but he lived in a time of hostile religious debate between
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.080]   Christians, a lot of infighting.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.840]   Do you think this infighting soured him to the faith or what impact did it have on him?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.080]   >>Ted: He, like a lot of people who are influenced by what we broadly call the Enlightenment
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:49.840]   of the 18th century, believes that there are good things about religion and Christianity,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:56.720]   but they have seen that as practiced, going back to certainly the Reformation, the wars
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.440]   of religion that were happening in the 16th, 17th, 18th century, often between Protestant
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.360]   and Catholic power, fighting within Puritan churches, Congregationalist and Presbyterian
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   denominations, expulsions of pastors.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.240]   He got involved in a very technical theological debate, public debate in the 1730s over a
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.320]   favorite pastor of his in Philadelphia who was being disciplined by the Presbyterian
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.160]   denomination over what Franklin thought were just some pointless theological issues.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.840]   I think some other Christians might think that they were actually pretty important,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:48.200]   but he focused on why can't we just live out Christianity and Christ's teachings on ethics
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   and morality and the Beatitudes and so forth, and set aside or deemphasize these doctrinal
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:04.400]   disputes about issues like justification and the atonement and whether we should require
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.880]   assent to the Westminster Confession of Faith and these kind of things.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.000]   He just grew up with these kind of controversies, and I think for some good reasons got tired
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.960]   of it and wondered whether you could have a much more ethically focused kind of Christianity
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   that was much less doctrinal.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.880]   And so I think that childhood and then young adult kind of experience with those sorts
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:38.080]   of controversies and just a knowledge of history and the wars of religion helped to give him
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   a skeptical view not only of certain doctrines but kind of doctrinalism and thought that
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.400]   Christianity should go a different way.
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:55.320]   On that note, you write this quote, "Franklin was a pioneer of a distinctly American kind
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.640]   of a religion, doctrineless, moralized Christianity."
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.640]   I don't think as Americans we see this as our contribution to the world, but it really
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   it is.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.320]   I mean, how revolutionary was this in his day?
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:18.680]   Yeah, I mean, he's one of the founding fathers of this kind of religion, and I think doctrineless,
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:25.280]   moralized Christianity, if that is still Christianity, which is kind of an open question in my book,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:33.320]   you know, that's, it's such a common kind of belief system.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:40.000]   I mean, it's not quite a formal religion necessarily for a lot of people, but the folks who have
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.040]   followed everybody from Dale Carnegie to go back a while to Stephen Covey with Seven Habits
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   of Highly Effective People to Oprah to Joel Osteen to even, you know, contemporary kind
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.520]   of, you know, podcasters like Tim Ferriss and so forth.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.320]   I mean, this type of belief about your best life now, as Joel Osteen would put it, that
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:15.120]   the point is to live the kind of life that, you know, God or your higher power or whatever,
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.600]   you know, wants you to live right now, and it doesn't really matter that much how you
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.680]   get there in terms of what you believe.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.160]   The point is the quality of your life now.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:32.200]   And the emphasis that this is not only the right way to live, but it's the best and most
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.800]   effective way to live.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.240]   I mean, that is so utterly common if you go back through that list of names and you think
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:47.440]   about the incredible titanic best-selling books and popular shows and podcasts and everything
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.560]   that this kind of philosophy has produced.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:59.560]   And it doesn't necessarily overtly contradict Orthodox Christianity, which is one of the
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.700]   ways it can be, I think, pernicious.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:11.040]   And so it is so influential, and I think that Franklin is certainly one of the founding
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.080]   fathers, and often explicitly.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:19.040]   I mean, Stephen Covey's company was called Franklin Covey, right?
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:27.320]   Because, you know, this is explicitly drawing on the urtexts of this movement, like Franklin's
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:35.640]   The Way to Wealth, like his Father Abraham speech, which it just gives all these proverb-sounding
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   kind of statements, you know, early to bed, early to rise, and so forth.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.480]   You know, no pains, no gains.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.680]   You can't even believe some of these things that came from Franklin.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:58.680]   And so it's extraordinarily important in terms of American religion, world religion, but
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.480]   because it's so pervasive, it's like the air we breathe.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.000]   We almost don't notice it because this kind of belief system is so pervasive.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.040]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:17.800]   For Franklin, it seems almost as if, for him, the chief end of man is to be productive and
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.000]   to live virtuously.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.960]   Would you agree with that sort of overview?
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:30.200]   Yeah, I think that that's right, to be benevolent, to be generous, to be virtuous.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:38.240]   And I think he did think that probably, I do say probably, that there would be a future
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   judgment by God of our works.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.480]   And so he thought that it's the happiest way to live, it's the most effective way to live,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:58.080]   and that in the end, we'll be rewarded by God for our good deeds.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.680]   And so this, of course, is turning away from the legacy of Puritanism that would have understood
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.900]   that we can't do any good deeds without regeneration and this kind of thing.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.560]   But I think that Franklin here, again, is saying, "Let's take everything about the ethics
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:22.880]   and virtue taught by Christianity, taught by Jesus, and not worry about what he saw
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.760]   as the divisive doctrine."
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.320]   So yes, I think the chief end of man is to live a virtuous life.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.840]   And he might even sort of say, "Okay, fine, if you want to say, 'And please God in doing
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.320]   that,'" he might have been willing even to add that.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.720]   Yeah, a virtue was huge in colonial America, of course.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:49.520]   How would you compare Franklin's list of virtues with the list of resolutions that was written
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.520]   by Jonathan Edwards?
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.560]   I mean, these are two different guys setting out to achieve virtue, but with very different
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560]   worldviews.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.600]   How would you compare Franklin's list of virtues with Edwards' resolutions?
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:11.840]   Yeah, I think that Franklin's idea is very much a virtue born out of effort and discipline,
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.880]   and that is very much directed towards the only way that Franklin would say that we know
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.960]   to love God in this life is to do good to people.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.480]   And I mean, again, there are shades of differences here.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.400]   I mean, you get some things like that out of the Gospels about doing unto the least
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.000]   of these and so forth.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.320]   I mean, those kind of teachings, it's just that someone like Edwards or George Whitefield,
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:51.320]   Franklin's longtime friend, would say you're not understanding that the greatest good is
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:58.440]   love of God and that our capability for good comes out of regeneration.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:05.600]   I mean, so Whitefield and Edwards would say this kind of man-centered good that doesn't
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.800]   require any kind of transforming power from God might look good from a worldly perspective,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:21.560]   but because of our sin, our best efforts in this life without any assistance from God
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.520]   is just filthy rags.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.200]   And so I think that Franklin just simply didn't buy that.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:33.280]   I think he just thought, "Well, you just do your best, and you try to be sincere and disciplined
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:39.560]   and go after virtue, and God will understand that we fall short."
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.360]   And so I think Edwards and Whitefield would have said, "Bottom line, what you're missing
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:56.240]   is the new birth in Christ and the understanding that because of our sin, God cannot accept
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.960]   us on the basis of just a lot of effort."
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.400]   It's no secret that Franklin loved prostitutes.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   It's a reality.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.000]   I mean, he was not an angel.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.160]   How do you think he processed his own lack of virtue?
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:20.800]   Well, I think it is easy to see in retrospect, and Franklin knew this too, that virtue that
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.400]   only depends on your own effort, I think is gonna be necessarily limited in its success.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.360]   I mean, that kind of philosophy.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:36.880]   And so when he went to London as a young man, he and some of his friends there really kind
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:46.400]   of went wild and took in all that London had to offer in those days, and he really sowed
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.520]   his wild oats.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:55.520]   And even Franklin came to realize, I think pretty clearly, that he couldn't go on this
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.520]   way.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:03.240]   I mean, he was running up debts, he was worried about venereal disease.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:10.160]   We don't know who the mother of his child, William, his son William was, but some people
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   think it may have been a prostitute.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   And so he realized that he needed to get his act together.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.520]   And so when he came back to America, he sort of put together the system of moral resolution
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.620]   that was gonna be his guide, he said, for the rest of his life.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:38.880]   The problem is that when you see him come up against temptation, especially in relationships
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:48.720]   with women later in life, in middle age and going on into amazingly old age, he had a
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   series of relationships that were certainly inappropriate with other women for, Franklin
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:04.180]   as a married man by then, and it is conspicuous that his talk about his moral system sort
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.320]   of goes quiet in those years and on those topics.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:16.640]   And we just don't see if it's all up to us, if it's all up to our discipline.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.400]   And Franklin will say this at times, you can excuse anything.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:27.840]   Now having said all that, I do want to caution that it's not as if, and Christians who are
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:33.200]   listening know this very well, it's not as if being in Christ sort of solves all your
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:39.240]   problems with regard to sin or eliminates all your blind spots.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.560]   And I talked about this in my biography of George Whitefield, for instance, that George
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:51.760]   Whitefield was involved in slavery and the slave trade, and he just didn't see the problem
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   with it.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.640]   And we can see in retrospect that there's all kinds of immoral issues going on with
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.840]   the slave trade.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.400]   So it's not as if I would say, "Oh, if only he had been a Christian, then he would have
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   lived in perfect holiness," or something like that.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:17.480]   But it is, I think, pretty conspicuous how limited this moral code is when, for instance,
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.880]   it doesn't stop you, it doesn't even really seem to raise questions for him about the
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:31.480]   propriety of the series of relationships he has with married women, women who are much,
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.880]   much younger than him, you know, really just pretty salacious stuff.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.040]   And his moral code just doesn't seem to come into play.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.720]   So it's inadequate, I think, at moments where he needed to do much better.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.720]   >>Joseph: Okay.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.640]   I want to press into the pragmatics a little more.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.920]   One writer said Franklin had, quote, "a love for the useful," end quote.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.600]   I mean, he was a hacker.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.640]   Technology itself can feed pragmatism and a utilitarianism within us.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   And I think this is true in our own day.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.680]   We life hack our diets and our work habits and our sleep patterns and really all of life.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.280]   Everything has an app now.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.240]   We can trace the minutia of our day, every calorie, every step that we take.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.060]   We can manage our calendars down to the second.
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.440]   But if we're not careful, life can get boiled down to everything just becomes the right
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.200]   technique.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.640]   And when you see this in America today, how much has Ben Franklin behind this?
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.160]   What's his role in life hacking today?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:46.240]   >>John: Well, he thought that a life that is maximally effective to do good, there's
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.760]   another way to put it, about what his life goal was.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.160]   And so he wanted to be successful in useful fields.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.960]   And so he would discipline himself in terms of use of time.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.920]   He was focused on diet.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.600]   I mean, everything you might expect out of that kind of life hacking literature, you
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:14.680]   know, blogs and so forth today, he was interested in those kinds of issues too because he wanted
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.840]   to be freed up to be the most successful, effective entrepreneur that he could be, especially
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.000]   as a young man.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.520]   But he said that these things all need to serve benevolent goods.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:35.400]   I mean, you need to be doing good for people and not involved in just trashy pursuits.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:43.680]   And so, I mean, for instance, one of the most famous instances was he had his list of the
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.920]   virtues.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:53.000]   And he would keep a daily chart for some years of his life that he would say, you know, "Have
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I been modest?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.480]   Have I controlled my speech?"
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.800]   And all these kind of – and he's going down the list and checking it.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.840]   "Yes, I did all these things today," or "No, I failed here and there."
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.960]   I'm not sure in that system how you account for pride because it seems to me that if you're
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.320]   checking off all the boxes about how well you've done, that may undermine the pride
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   issue.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.600]   But anyway, you know, he would try to systematize all these things and say, you know, "I can
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:31.360]   count up how well I'm doing and the expectations I hold for myself."
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.440]   And so tracking it, measuring it, you know, he again is a pioneer on all those kind of
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.680]   life hacking things.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:46.960]   But I think the difference for him is that he knew that all these things were supposed
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.280]   to at least feed into virtue.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:55.160]   I'm not sure that all of our life hacking folks, podcasts, bloggers, and everything
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.440]   today necessarily – I mean, it's often in the background, but because Franklin was
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.360]   so deeply familiar with the Christian virtues from his upbringing, that just came naturally
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:15.480]   to him, and he still felt, I think, obligated to live with responsibilities to that virtuous
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.280]   code, which he would readily admit he derived from Christianity.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.520]   Yeah, that's really a key point, and it seems like he even tried to life hack the
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.480]   Christian life, too.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:33.360]   You write of Franklin this, "Church attendance had its utility when rightly conducted."
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.560]   Church attendance had its utility when rightly conducted.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.280]   How did the church become for Franklin a form of utility?
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:49.880]   Well, I think he thought that most people certainly needed religion, and for him, I
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   don't think he would have said it had to be Christianity, but I think he would have
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   conceded that Christianity was – maybe he would have said the most sublime kind of religious
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:08.560]   code system of ethics, that it's the best, but it's not necessarily an exclusive thing.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:15.680]   He would have said you need religion to give you a set of morals, a virtuous ideal, and
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:23.720]   certainly Christ is a wonderful, virtuous, ideal example for us to follow.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:30.960]   I think he thought that churches brought accountability for ethics and virtue, that churches were
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:37.800]   a great way to live out a virtuous life, because churches gave you a way to be engaged in working
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:44.600]   with the poor, and churches filled – I mean, in an era when the government performed very
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.560]   few social welfare functions, I mean, the churches did that.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:55.600]   They worked on education, health care, all kinds of poor relief efforts.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.640]   And so he was great with – especially if churches were doing those kind of things,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.480]   outreach and ministering to people, Franklin loved that.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.920]   This is actually part of the reason why I think Franklin admired George Whitefield,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:18.240]   the great revivalist, so much is that we forget that Whitefield was very well known in his
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:24.800]   time for his Bethesda orphanage in Georgia, which was the great charitable project of
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.040]   Whitefield's career.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:33.040]   And Franklin gave money to the Bethesda orphanage and thought, yes, what we need are these great
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.320]   social experiments and taking care of the least of these, like orphans.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.080]   Franklin was involved in the first hospital in Philadelphia, which – and Franklin's
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.520]   own publicity was explicitly Christian, justified on explicitly Christian grounds.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.360]   So he thought, if that's what church is about, if that's what religion is about,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:01.000]   is about benevolent service, then that's my kind of thing.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:10.360]   If it's about dry doctrine and helping out the institutional church and its pastors
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.920]   and so forth, he's not keen on that.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.600]   And so that's why he thinks, you know, churches are great, and I think he would say we need
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.880]   churches, but only to the extent that it's encouraging practical virtue.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.000]   His theology becomes problematic.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.320]   Franklin seemed to have layers of God as kind of a distinct theology.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.800]   Explain his theology proper.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.440]   How would you explain it to listeners?
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:47.960]   Franklin's ideas about God are changing over his lifetime, and they're often speculative.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:54.360]   I mean, it's not as if he has, you know, just this one set of beliefs.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.720]   I mean, he often will sort of say, "Well, maybe it's like this," or "I have doubts
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.160]   about that."
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.920]   And so it can be very difficult to pin him down about exactly what he does believe and
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.120]   doesn't believe.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:14.840]   What you're suggesting is that early in life, as a young man, he wrote a document about
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   articles of belief in which – it's a very strange document – where he speculates about
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   something that sounds like polytheism, that there's maybe this one great superintending
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:36.120]   God, but we don't really have any access to that God, and so that there are these sort
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:43.600]   of lesser gods who kind of represent God to us, and that maybe Jesus is sort of one of
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   these demigods or something like that.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:53.640]   I mean, it's weird stuff, you know, to our perspective, and he really doesn't follow
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.400]   that up very much.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.960]   So it's one of those things about which one of these documents should we take totally
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.520]   seriously.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.940]   But I think the consistent thing, especially once he goes through a pretty radical phase
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:16.040]   in his teens and early twenties, and then I think he settles down and basically believes
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:23.440]   that virtue's the point of religion, there is a God that probably is like God the Father
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:33.720]   in the Bible, that Jesus has given us a supreme code of ethics to follow, that there is almost
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:41.440]   certainly an afterlife and a future judgment, and that God is somehow providentially involved
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.440]   with the world.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.360]   And this is a difference between Franklin and some of the more radical deists.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:54.160]   A lot of the English deists in particular said that God was like the cosmic watchmaker,
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   that he wound the world up and then just left, and that God isn't around anymore.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.600]   Franklin had a stronger view of providence than that.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.320]   And Franklin even believed, especially later on in life, that prayer probably did some
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:15.520]   good if for no other reason than it had a kind of disciplining effect on us.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.580]   But this is why Franklin is the one, the solitary figure really, who asked the Constitutional
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.400]   Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 to open its sessions with prayer.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.840]   And it's such a strange scene.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:34.480]   I mean, you think, "Well, this guy's a skeptic and a deist, and yet here he is.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.360]   He proposes that the Constitutional Convention open its sessions with prayer, and it's a
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.640]   motion that they don't adopt."
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:46.760]   I mean, what's so amazing to me about it is that the rest of the delegates sort of say,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.760]   "Yeah, that's complicated.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.360]   Who's going to pray?
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.880]   Let's not worry about that.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.360]   Let's just do our business here."
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:58.480]   A lot of Christian popular historians will narrate that story and say, "Oh, look how
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.600]   wonderful that Franklin proposed prayer," but that they don't give the rest of the story
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.240]   that they decided not to.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:13.160]   And so Franklin, among the convention delegates, seems to actually believe more in prayer than
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.880]   most of the other people.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.160]   It's strange to pin down on these kind of things.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.160]   It's an incredible scene, yeah.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.480]   And you open the book with it.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.920]   It's so vivid.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.560]   And yet God still seems quite impersonal to him.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.720]   It seems that Christ, the atoning God-man who shed his blood for sinners, who approaches
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.200]   and reaches us and who makes a way for us to God, this Christ is really a stumbling
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.560]   block for Franklin, it seems.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:48.920]   I mean, the wonderful, if troubling, thing about Franklin is that Ezra Stiles, who was
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:57.240]   the president of Yale, basically pinned Franklin down about six weeks before he died and said,
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.160]   "Mr. Franklin, you've done so many wonderful things, but I don't know, Mr. Franklin, that
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:08.520]   I've ever heard you say what you think about Jesus."
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:15.800]   And Stiles was a sort of basically Orthodox Christian, and he was trying to see if he
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.360]   could get Franklin to make a profession of faith.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.040]   Franklin, it's standard operating procedure with Franklin.
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.600]   He kind of turns it into a joke.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.840]   That's another problem with pinning Franklin down is he'll joke about anything.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:37.640]   And so he says, "You know, I've always had doubts about the deity of Christ.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.760]   I've had doubts about the deity of Christ."
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.200]   But then he says, "But you know, I'm so old now that I might as well not worry about it
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.480]   because I'm going to find out pretty soon anyway."
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.440]   Sure enough, several weeks later, he died, and so he found out.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:58.360]   You know, I think that's basically right, that he is just not sure whether he can believe
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:06.200]   the Christian tradition and the Scriptures when they say that Jesus was the Son of God.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:14.120]   He's convinced that Jesus was a great moral teacher, but Savior, Messiah, Son of God,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.720]   Great Person of the Trinity, you know, he just isn't sure.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:24.960]   And I think that Franklin believes, you know, "Why do I have to make some kind of firm commitment
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.040]   on things that I'm not sure about anyway?
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:34.000]   Why don't we just, again, go back to let's live a loving, benevolent, virtuous life and
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.960]   let God sort out the doctrinal details?"
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:45.520]   He's the sort of person who says, "I'm just going to worry about what I know I can do."
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.000]   And he does keep God, I think, at arm's length.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.640]   I mean, there is this personal prayer guide that he—a devotional guide that he writes
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.840]   for himself in which he seems to indicate an understanding that God is to be worshipped,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.960]   but even there, what he says that we know about God is only revealed in the natural
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.800]   world, you know, the splendor and the mysteries of the universe.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   And that's true.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:22.160]   Again, I mean, these are things that you can find some support for in Scripture, but as
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:28.600]   far as revealed knowledge about God, I think Franklin would say, "I just don't know how
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:35.360]   much of the Bible I can believe, and so why don't I just stick to the this-worldly, practical,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:42.440]   utilitarian, moral responsibilities and let others worry about doctrinal issues?"
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:47.600]   And so there again is where the doctrinalist Christianity comes in, and whether that's
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   an oxymoron right from the get-go, I think it is.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:58.920]   But he thought that this is sort of the new, enlightened kind of form of Christianity that
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:05.960]   he hoped would take root, and, you know, in some ways in American pop culture, in global
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.720]   pop culture, it certainly has.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.200]   I think for Reformed and Evangelical Christians, though, of course, they'll say, "I mean, we
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:22.760]   have to worship God in spirit and truth for the things, of course, that are revealed in
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:30.520]   the natural world, but that are revealed in Scripture, and that true goodness can't be
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:36.240]   lived out without God's power and regenerating work in our lives."
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.200]   And so that's where I think that a lot of Christians reading my book are going to say,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.640]   "Yeah, I mean, in this worldly sense, in just the natural order of things, this guy lived
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:57.360]   an admirable, in many ways, remarkable, successful life, but he may have missed the biggest point
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.760]   of all, which is a relationship, a saving relationship with Jesus Christ."
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.560]   Yeah, that's tragic.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.040]   His friend George Whitefield certainly saw the glory of Christ and spent his life proclaiming
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040]   that glory.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:13.960]   What do we know of Whitefield's attempts to reach Franklin with the Gospel?
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.600]   They had an amazing relationship, because here they are.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.360]   I mean, Whitefield, by the time he meets Franklin in the late 1730s, Whitefield has already
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:32.000]   become easily the most famous pastor or preacher in the British and American world.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And Franklin really, you know, as they say, he hitched his wagon to Whitefield's star,
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   right?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.800]   He said, "This guy is like anything I've ever seen, and I can make a lot of money off
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.880]   of this."
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.240]   So Franklin is publishing all of Whitefield's journals and sermons, and Franklin publishes
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.640]   anti-Whitefield stuff, too.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:57.600]   It's a big part of the reason why Franklin is able to retire early, is because, I mean,
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.840]   he made so much money off of Whitefield.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   But in that business relationship, then they became friends.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:09.120]   And so they were just amazing letters that they would write back and forth to each other.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:16.640]   And Franklin, you know, he made clear to Whitefield that he appreciated his charitable work and
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.720]   all this, but that he didn't believe in Christ the way that Whitefield said people needed
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720]   to.
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:30.720]   And so Whitefield would talk very frankly, write very frankly to Ben about this, and
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.320]   my favorite letter between them is a letter that Whitefield wrote to him in the 1750s.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:44.160]   Now Franklin has become as famous as Whitefield is, because of Franklin's scientific experiments.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:48.800]   And Whitefield says to him, "You know, Mr. Franklin, I see that you've made all this
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:54.740]   wonderful progress in the mysteries of science and electricity.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.680]   Now," he said, "I implore you to study the mysteries of the new birth."
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.040]   Beautiful, that's beautiful.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.240]   And you know, Franklin's just always like, "Yeah, you know, I knew that's what you were
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.440]   going to say to me."
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:16.640]   And he never goes over the line of faith, and Franklin writes poignantly in his autobiography
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:24.040]   that, you know, Mr. Whitefield would often pray for my conversion, but he never had the
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.560]   pleasure of believing that those prayers were answered.
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.440]   Whitefield dies about 20 years before Franklin does, and so the autobiography comes out after
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   Whitefield's death.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.240]   But even after that, even after Whitefield's death, I mean, Franklin would go out of his
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   way to talk about how much he admired, and not just admired, but loved Whitefield as
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.880]   a friend.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.920]   And so I think it's a wonderful example of somebody, Whitefield, who is a strong believer,
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:01.160]   obviously, and the greatest preacher of his time, who is able to maintain this kind of
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:07.520]   sweet friendship with a non-believer like Franklin, and not push him away, but also
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.600]   to be transparent with him about his faith.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:17.800]   It really is convicting, I think, to me about, you know, two such famous, wonderful people
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:22.840]   who are not on the same page spiritually, but they're able to maintain that friendship.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.240]   It's just a great example on Whitefield's part.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.280]   Yeah, and very convicting, Dr. Kidd.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:32.360]   It is always a pleasure, whenever I need the latest celebrity gossip out of the 18th century,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   you deliver.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.680]   You're like the TMZ of colonial America.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   I will receive that, yes.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.200]   The man putting up with me today is author and Baylor University historian Tommy Kidd.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.800]   We're talking about his excellent book, "Benjamin Franklin, the Religious Life of a Founding
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   Father," due out in May of 2017 from Yale.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.440]   He's also the author of "George Whitefield, America's Spiritual Founding Father," published
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.920]   by Yale in 2014, and more recently, "American Colonial History, Clashing Cultures and Faiths,"
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.240]   published this year by Yale.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.040]   He is a readable historian that every Christian should be familiar with.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.240]   Well, thanks for listening to this special long-form conversation in the Ask Pastor John
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   podcast series.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:13.520]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and I'll be back on Monday with John Piper, and I'll ask him,
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:18.320]   if we have died to sin, why must we kill our sin daily?
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.640]   We'll see you on Monday.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.180]   [end]
