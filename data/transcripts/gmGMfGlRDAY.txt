[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   - Well, welcome back to the podcast on this Monday morning.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.760]   If you are with us on Friday,
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.480]   we looked at the sin that remains in us as believers.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.720]   And it raises another question,
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.780]   one about confession for sin.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.920]   That is, if God has forgiven all of our trespasses,
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.840]   and if all of our sins were canceled at the cross,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.760]   why do we need to continue to repent?
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   It's a question inspired by the glorious truth
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.040]   of Christ's finished work in Colossians 2, verses 13 to 14.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   And the question comes to us from a listener named Judy,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.880]   who lives in Rockford, Illinois.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.400]   Dear Pastor John, I'm struggling with a question
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.000]   regarding God's word and want your input.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   Once we have repented and turned to the Lord for salvation,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.000]   is it necessary to repent every time we sin afterwards?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.320]   I've always believed that,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.400]   but recently someone told me
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.860]   that after our initial repentance at the time of salvation,
[00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240]   ongoing repentance is no longer necessary.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.860]   At first I was flummoxed,
[00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.780]   but then there are so many verses that say
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.540]   he has forgiven our sins past, present, and future,
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.520]   Colossians 2, 13 to 14, for example.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.240]   Christ has forgiven all of our sins,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.620]   canceled all of our debts,
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.740]   and has nailed it all to the cross finally and fully.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.420]   So am I doubting this work
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.340]   if I go on repenting for my sin?
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.700]   I'm a former Roman Catholic,
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.560]   and this ongoing confession of sin reminds me
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.660]   of their way of keeping Jesus on the cross
[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.020]   through false traditions.
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.300]   Can you help me think through this?
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.980]   - Maybe the most important thing
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.060]   that I could do to help Judy
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.740]   is to point her and the rest of us
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.780]   to the all-important distinction
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.700]   between redemption as something
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.060]   that is already accomplished and finished once for all,
[00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640]   never to be repeated or added to,
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.540]   and redemption that is applied to us
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.700]   when we're saved, when we're converted,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.280]   and then in an ongoing way now and forever.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.860]   And in making that distinction,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860]   we will see that forgiveness of sins,
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.580]   which is what she asked him in particular,
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.820]   can be viewed in these two ways,
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.900]   accomplished and applied.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.700]   Which relate, I think, directly to her question.
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.780]   So let me unpack this understanding of redemption
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.580]   for just a moment,
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.740]   and then look at her question specifically.
[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.540]   Here's what I mean by the once for all,
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.020]   finished, complete, never to be repeated,
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.780]   never to be added to, redemption.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860]   When Christ died on the cross
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.780]   for his bride, the church,
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.940]   as Paul says in Ephesians 5, 25 to 27,
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.820]   he accomplished at least four decisive
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.660]   once for all things.
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.260]   First, Christ offered a perfect
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.640]   sin-covering sacrifice to God.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.340]   So perfect that unlike the Old Testament sacrifices,
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.840]   it never needs to be repeated.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.800]   To be repeated, cannot be repeated.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   Hebrew 7, 27, Christ has no need
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.160]   like those high priests to offer sacrifices daily,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.480]   first for his own sins and then for the people,
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.980]   since he did this once for all
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.480]   when he offered up himself.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.800]   In other words, a perfect once for all,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   never to be repeated, sacrifice for sin.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.320]   That's number one, that happened decisively on the cross.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560]   Number two, this sacrifice accomplished
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.880]   what the New Testament calls propitiation.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   Romans 3, 25, God put Christ forward
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.900]   as a propitiation by his blood.
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.800]   In other words, when he died, this happened.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.360]   To be received later, when you come into existence
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.200]   2,000 years later, by faith.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.920]   This means that the sacrifice of Christ
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.420]   provided a holy and righteous satisfaction
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.320]   of the demands of God's justice in the punishment of sin.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.480]   And so his condemning wrath is removed
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.640]   forever from his people.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.240]   Third, positively the New Testament calls this
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.160]   reconciliation.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.000]   From God's side, the hostility of wrath
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   is removed toward his son's bride.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.300]   And fourth, by this sacrifice,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.240]   God decisively purchased, paid the finished price
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.480]   for the liberty of his people
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.960]   from sin and wrath and death and Satan.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.960]   1 Corinthians 6, 19, you are not your own,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.380]   you were bought with a price.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.200]   That's finished, that's done.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.960]   The price has been paid.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.120]   So these four realities are what I mean
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.220]   by a once for all, finished, complete,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.160]   never to be repeated redemption.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.880]   It happened in history before we ever existed.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.080]   It was outside ourselves.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.000]   I can remember, what, 45 years ago,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   sitting in a seminary class where the first time
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.660]   I heard the Latin phrase extra nos,
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.760]   because of Luther, outside ourselves,
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.400]   and it had just never hit me before
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.560]   that all the decisive things had been done already for me.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.020]   So God did this for everyone who would be
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.380]   united to Christ.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.840]   A perfect final sacrifice,
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.280]   an all-satisfying propitiation,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.520]   a glorious reconciliation from God's side
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.560]   with the removal of all divine condemnation,
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.840]   a full purchase of our liberty from wrath and sin
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.600]   and death and Satan forever, a finished price paid.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.960]   Then the question becomes,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.560]   how does this once for all redemption
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.920]   get applied to actual people,
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.640]   us, individuals in real life?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.480]   And of course, we could write books,
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.880]   I mean, books and books on the answer to that question.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.800]   He calls us out of darkness into light.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   He regenerates us by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.640]   He unites us to Christ so that everything Christ accomplished
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.280]   is made ours in Him.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   He gives us the gift of faith.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   He justifies us.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.360]   He adopts us.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.600]   He sanctifies us over a lifetime.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.640]   He causes us to persevere to the end.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.280]   He intercedes for us continually in heaven.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.240]   He glorifies us with life and joy forever in His presence.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.800]   All of that is the application to us
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.760]   individually of what was decisively secured 2,000 years ago,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.000]   once for all, when Christ died and rose again.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And Judy's question relates now to the forgiveness of sins
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.760]   and the ongoing act, her act,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   of what she calls repentance.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   So let's put forgiveness of sins into this understanding
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.040]   of redemption accomplished and redemption applied,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.080]   which by the way, is the title of a very important book
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.680]   by John Murray, which I recommend to everybody to read
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.280]   if you wanna go deep and get a lot of help
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.120]   about these things.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.160]   Redemption accomplished and applied, John Murray.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.640]   Ephesians 1, 7 says,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.360]   so I'm focusing now on forgiveness of sins
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.080]   and trying to see whether the Bible
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.440]   puts it into this framework.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   In Christ, we have redemption through His blood,
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.320]   the forgiveness of our trespasses.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   In other words, in the shedding of Christ's blood,
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.840]   once for all in history,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.240]   all who are in Christ have forgiveness
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.400]   for all their sins.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   We have it, he says, we have it.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   We have them absolutely secure.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.360]   We have them purchased for us.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.660]   That's what the blood accomplished and secured.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.120]   Colossians 2, 14, that she referred to,
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.120]   the record of our debts was nailed to the cross.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.060]   That's what I would call forgiveness accomplished.
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.320]   Christ paid redemption, offered nails,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.640]   driven forgiveness secured.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.480]   It is accomplished.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.440]   Then Acts 10, 43 says,
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.440]   everyone who believes in Christ
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   receives forgiveness of sins through His name.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.200]   When we believe,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.000]   we receive the forgiveness Christ purchased.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.360]   That's forgiveness applied.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.800]   So when we become Christians,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   we are united to Christ
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.960]   so that the forgiveness He purchased
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.800]   becomes the forgiveness we experience.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.080]   And since the purchase was complete
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.720]   and He nailed the whole record of our debt to the cross,
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.120]   therefore, the whole purchase will be experienced.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.200]   It will be.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.240]   God doesn't lose any of His own.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.720]   The final question is then,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.880]   since we are conformed to Christ progressively
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.120]   and not all at once,
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.460]   therefore, Christians are going to sin.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:18.240]   There are no sinless Christians in action.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   If you say you have no sin, you're a liar, John said.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.160]   What should our attitude be then
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.160]   toward our ongoing acts and attitudes and words of sin?
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.080]   No genuine Christian who loves Christ
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   can be cavalier about the very thing Christ died to abolish,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.140]   namely our sin.
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.280]   That would be one mistake we could make.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   We could be cavalier in our attitude.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.480]   Well, He died to forgive them all,
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.520]   so they don't really matter
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.680]   because they're all covered by blood.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.160]   No true Christian talks like that about his own sin.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.520]   But the other mistake would be to panic
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.480]   and feel that with every sin,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.080]   there needs to be a new redemption,
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.280]   a new sacrifice, a new penance.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.520]   And I mention penance because that might be
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.400]   what Judy feels perhaps coming out
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.620]   of her former religious tradition that she mentions.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.020]   I have to pay something, right?
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.300]   I see it, I have to pay something, I have to make this right.
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.320]   That would be a great mistake.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.280]   The payment was perfect.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.120]   You can't add to it at all.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.040]   You can't add to your sin covering at all.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.480]   Instead, what the New Testament says in 1 John 1:9 is,
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:45.520]   "If we confess," I'm gonna underline that word,
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.800]   repentance or penance might not be
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.940]   the most helpful word here.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.920]   Just stick with John's word.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.140]   "If we confess our sins."
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.580]   Confess means, homologo means agree with.
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.300]   See it the way God sees it.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.960]   Feel about it the way God feels about it.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.240]   "If we confess our sins, He is faithful
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.500]   and just to forgive our sins
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.720]   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.560]   So confessing is not a payment.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   It is simply an agreement with God
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   that this was an ugly and unworthy thing for me to do
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.920]   and I'm ashamed of it.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.680]   I'm sorry for it.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.960]   I turn from it.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   I embrace the finished, complete, perfect, once for all
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.000]   work of Christ afresh.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.260]   I rest in it.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.860]   I enjoy the fellowship that He secured.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.040]   - Yeah, very good word.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.160]   Thank you, Pastor John, for bringing all of those texts
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.360]   and realities together for us today on the podcast.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.880]   If you have a Bible question like this one today from Judy,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.720]   ask away.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.840]   Email us your question through our online home
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.560]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.520]   We have two remaining episodes this week
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.840]   and we're going to devote them both
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.320]   to the theme of physical healing.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.880]   On Wednesday, we're gonna talk about timing.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.720]   God has promised to heal us, so when will He do it?
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.560]   Now?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.600]   Later?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.000]   And why did Christ seem to heal so few
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.760]   in His own earthly ministry?
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.060]   At least it appears that way.
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.380]   And then on Friday, we'll talk about healing ministries
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.540]   today, should we trust them or not?
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.180]   And do we avoid them because these ministries are fraudulent
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.400]   or do we avoid them because of our own unbelief?
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.480]   It's a big end to the week.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.440]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke,
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
