[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480]   - Happy New Year everyone.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.200]   2023 is here and we launch our new year
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.640]   with a more informal episode than normal.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.520]   This one was recorded live in Nashville, Tennessee
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.080]   in front of 2000 friends of ours who were,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.360]   well, they were quite engaged as you can hear.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.200]   Have a listen.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.720]   - How many of you are regular listeners to the podcast?
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.240]   (audience cheering)
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   The direction of our podcast is shaped
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.920]   by you, the listeners, right?
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760]   You send us the questions, we sift through those.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.260]   I ask John Piper the questions.
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.680]   I ask John Piper your most awkward questions.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.120]   I'm willing to do that for you
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.520]   because I serve you, our listeners.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.900]   And I've been wanting to do something like this
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.760]   for a long time on the podcast.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.740]   And I figured let's do this in Nashville.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.580]   Let's hear from John Piper about his favorite things.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.040]   Over the decade of APJ, we've received over 100 questions
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.180]   from listeners asking random questions
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.120]   about John Piper's favorite soft drink,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.280]   movies, novels, poets, things like that.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.480]   So I just compiled all of those questions.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.880]   I'm gonna pose them to Pastor John
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820]   and he's got a rapid fire respond, okay?
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.120]   So he can't elaborate very long on that.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.960]   - That's the problem.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.920]   - That's the problem, yeah.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.480]   So I boiled down these questions to 12, 12 questions.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.580]   Okay, here we go.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.480]   Ready, John Piper?
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.520]   - Yeah, but listen.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.040]   Some of these are gonna be really short,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.200]   like one word answer.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.120]   - That's good.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.520]   - Which means I can go longer on others, okay?
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160]   - All right, John Piper's favorite things.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.440]   Here we go, number one.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.880]   In APJ 696, you said, quote, "I have my favorite movies."
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.200]   And you left us at that.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.040]   You never told us.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.440]   What are your top three favorite movies?
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.280]   - I consulted my wife about this.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.240]   I knew this question was coming.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.840]   And we agreed that at the top would be Henry V,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.300]   Kenneth Branagh's Shakespearean movie.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.880]   An amazing speech that a pastor cannot listen to
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   and not be moved to tears.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.480]   We few, we happy few.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.760]   Tomorrow who sheds his blood with me will be my brother.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.660]   And then England defeats France at five to one odds.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.660]   And they sing, no, nobis, nobis domine,
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.540]   said domine gloria.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.500]   Not to us, oh Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.720]   It's just a riveting, dramatic Shakespearean piece.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.560]   That's number one.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.680]   Number two would be "Chariots of Fire,"
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.320]   which you have seen.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.320]   And the scene of him opening the note that God glorifies
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.920]   or God honors those who honor him.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.100]   Powerful statement that moved me deeply.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   And my wife said, you really have to say "Princess Bride."
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.140]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.280]   But you don't know why I have to say "Princess Bride."
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.020]   And the reason is because when I first saw it,
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.820]   I was preaching through Hebrews.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.840]   And there is one scene that's serious
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.720]   in this hilarious movie.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.820]   And it's the scene where,
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.800]   now I had to go back and remind myself the names
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.060]   'cause I forget names.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.020]   Inigo Montoya is standing at the top of the cliff
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.820]   and Wesley's climbing the cliff
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.720]   and he's gonna fall down if he doesn't hold on.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.500]   And Inigo says, "I could drop you a rope."
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.860]   And he says, "Yeah, and then you would let go of the rope."
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.500]   And seriousness comes over his face.
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.980]   And he says, "I swear to you on the life of my father,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.260]   Domingo Montoya, I won't drop you."
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.820]   And Wesley gets serious and says, "Drop the rope."
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.060]   I use that in the next Sunday sermon.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.780]   [audience laughing]
[00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.380]   Because of the power of a promise
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.140]   and an oath in Hebrews.
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.980]   Okay.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.420]   >> All right, that's really good.
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.300]   That was elaborate, that was a little more elaborate.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.260]   >> It's way better.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.500]   I won't do that, I won't do that if you want.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.340]   I'm tempted to.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.580]   >> All right, your favorite novel.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580]   >> I'm gonna cheat again, but I won't elaborate.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.620]   "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr,
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.260]   a contemporary that is in the last 10 years,
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.020]   is a beautifully written book about the Second World War
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.060]   and the interweaving of lives of a young blind girl
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.580]   during the bombing of the Germans on France.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.820]   "All the Light We Cannot See."
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.420]   "A Man at Arms" by Stephen Pressfield is also contemporary,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.980]   written in the last five years probably,
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.980]   a dramatic telling of a young speechless girl
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.100]   carrying the Corinthian correspondence to Corinth,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.220]   Paul's letters to Corinth,
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.180]   and a man at arms steps up to be her protector.
[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.580]   Amazing book.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.740]   And then historically, I mean, if I had to pick a classic,
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.420]   it would be "Crime and Punishment" by Dostoevsky,
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.660]   just because the power of the description
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.980]   of the tormented soul of Raskolnikov is unparalleled.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.340]   >> It is unparalleled.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.180]   All right, number three,
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.540]   your favorite most frequently used Bible app.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.580]   >> Logos.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.740]   >> Logos Bible software.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.580]   >> Yes.
[00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.380]   >> iPhone, iPad, laptop, all three?
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.220]   >> All three.
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.060]   >> All three.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.180]   >> I'm on, like right now I'm on a leave working on,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.500]   look at the book, I'm on Logos nine hours a day.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.900]   I ran it into the ground.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.460]   We had to call them to get them to figure out
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.140]   how to make it work after nine hours of work.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.660]   And they fixed it for me.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.380]   And I use my iPad for my devotions
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.620]   and it's Logos that I use.
[00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.140]   I find I'm very indebted to Logos.
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.180]   >> That's good.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.140]   Your favorite poet, not in scripture.
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.020]   >> George Herbert died in 1633,
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.620]   wrote a collection called the Temple, 164 poems.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.460]   None of them has the same rhyme scheme or meter.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.860]   It's an absolutely amazing collection.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.900]   The content, the craft, those two things together,
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.700]   I think in Herbert are without peer.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.300]   >> Your favorite poem, not in scripture.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.060]   >> Well, you know, I thought a lot about that.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.060]   And my song is Love Unknown.
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.780]   Love Unknown is a hymn.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.500]   But if you just take away the beautiful music,
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.140]   ♪ My song is love unknown ♪
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.620]   ♪ My savior's love to me ♪
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.180]   That's the tune, beautiful tune.
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.180]   But Samuel Crossman's poem by itself is magnificent.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.340]   It's simply beautiful.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.340]   The rhyme structure and the meter is very unusual
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.220]   and it's very hard to put solid, deep, moving words
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.260]   without sounding corny into structures of rhyme and meter.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.580]   So my song is Love Unknown would be,
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.900]   and if I had to choose a non-religious one,
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.340]   it would be If by Rudyard Kipling.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.180]   If, if, if, if, then you will be a man, my son.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.020]   I love it.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.860]   >> Love that line.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.980]   Love to the loveless shown that they might lovely be.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.820]   >> Yes.
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.940]   >> Such a great line.
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.340]   All right, number six, your favorite,
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.980]   this is important.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.340]   This is what the people want to know, okay?
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.100]   Your favorite pop, soda, soft drink.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.980]   >> It moves back and forth between diet,
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.420]   Dr. Pepper and Diet Coke.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.780]   If I get tired of one, Noel will order the other
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.580]   and back and forth they go.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.420]   Which means in the Washington DC airport,
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.940]   there are no Coke products.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.700]   And if you walk around here, there are no Coke products.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.140]   It's just appalling.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.060]   [audience laughing]
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.500]   Like, where are we?
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.380]   >> Okay, your favorite dinner at home.
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.660]   >> My wife's spaghetti.
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.740]   She's sitting over there.
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.780]   >> There's Noel.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.940]   So this is, there's no, there's hands down.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.900]   [audience applauding]
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.980]   She would know the answer to that right away.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.620]   And so I'm just on her case to make it as often as possible
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.820]   when we have company and elsewhere.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.260]   >> Favorite restaurant.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.020]   >> Well, we talked about that one.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.500]   And she said, you can't say Chick-fil-A.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.580]   [audience laughing]
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.460]   And you can't say Chipotle,
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.620]   'cause they don't, he doesn't mean fast foods.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.820]   He means real bonafide restaurants.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.820]   And so I said, well, how about then Olive Garden?
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.060]   And she said, well, that would work.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.820]   That's true because our sons growing up,
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.500]   since we didn't very often go out to eat.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.660]   And when we did, we went to the places I like,
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.020]   like Chick-fil-A.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.420]   And then if we stepped it up, we would go to Olive Garden.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.020]   And they thought Olive Garden was fine dining.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.580]   [audience laughing]
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.860]   It is.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.780]   [audience laughing]
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.860]   Why would you want to go any higher than that?
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.940]   Food tastes weird if you go higher than that.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.060]   I mean, haven't you, the more expensive the restaurant,
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.620]   the weirder the food.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.140]   I don't know why expensive gourmet chefs
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.220]   make food taste strange.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.060]   It's just strange.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.260]   >> That is a man of refined palate.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.460]   >> I don't want my food to taste strange.
[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.660]   >> All right, let's cut the mic at that point.
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.140]   [audience laughing]
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.340]   All right, your favorite hobby?
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.220]   >> I love to play Scrabble with my wife.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.460]   I love to work in the yard.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.460]   I like to pull grass out of sidewalk crevices.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.780]   [audience laughing]
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.500]   I hate grass growing in sidewalks.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.060]   And I like straight borders.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.420]   I like it when the sidewalks are smooth.
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.540]   I don't like weeds growing around the boxwoods.
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:12.380]   I get a deep satisfaction from making things look Edenic
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.740]   or Eschatological, whichever way you want to look at it.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.700]   >> All right, number 10, your favorite breakfast.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.500]   A lot of you know what his favorite breakfast is,
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   but why don't you say it?
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.300]   >> So the first layer is grape nuts.
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.620]   And the second layer is mini shredded wheats,
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.420]   not the sweetened kind.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.740]   And the last layer is great heartland granola
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.340]   and then blueberries on top.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.740]   I've eaten that for years and years.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.140]   When we go on vacation, Noelle puts it all in a big sack
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.340]   and we take my breakfast,
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.540]   so I don't have to eat the stuff they serve here.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.340]   I can eat that.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.060]   >> All right.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.420]   [audience laughing]
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.220]   Number 11, your favorite song by a Christian.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.340]   Your favorite song by a Christian.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.060]   >> That's impossible, but just right off the front burner,
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.060]   since I'm 76 and death is just coming on very quickly,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:17.260]   the fresh rendition of Matt Merker's,
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:22.260]   "He Will Hold Me Fast" has risen in my affections
[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.060]   and in my personal singing and my church singing
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.060]   to a level of sweetness that few songs have in recent years.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.780]   Over the decades, I've had favorite hymns,
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.260]   but if you pushed my button right now
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.340]   and asked what would you like to sing,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.600]   what's your emotional quotient right now?
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.780]   It would be, "He holds me, he's holding me,
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.300]   I'll get through, he's holding me."
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.380]   And the music that he put to that old hymn is perfect.
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.420]   >> It is perfect.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.500]   All right, last, number 12,
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.460]   your favorite song by a non-Christian.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.940]   >> I don't listen to much music by non-Christians,
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.940]   but I did in the '60s.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.940]   So I think beautiful tunes were written in the '60s.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.200]   I think the Beatles wrote beautiful tunes.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.740]   I think Simon and Garfunkel wrote beautiful tunes
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.900]   and the Seekers wrote beautiful tunes.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.180]   And so I have a playlist in my phone
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.940]   called '60s Instrumental.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.780]   Get rid of the words,
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.900]   the words are usually nihilistic or vain,
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.720]   and so they're not helpful to me.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.140]   So maybe "Bridge Over Troubled Waters," Simon and Garfunkel.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.900]   "Bridge Over Troubled Waters" is a song I would default to.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.060]   Or I was playing a tune for Noelle the other day,
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.620]   I said, "Can you recognize this tune?"
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.940]   And she said, "I recognize the tune, but I can't name it."
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.760]   And it's "Here, There, and Everywhere" by the Beatles.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.260]   So I've got a '60s heart left in me.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.500]   - There it is, John Piper's 12 Favorite Things.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.420]   (audience cheering)
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.580]   - Such a great time.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.500]   Wonderful turnout, enthusiastic engagement,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.580]   as you can hear at the Getty Sing Conference
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.420]   this summer in Nashville.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.820]   And thank you for joining us for this first episode of 2023.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.140]   You can ask a question of your own,
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.260]   search our growing archive,
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.900]   or subscribe to the podcast all at askpastorjohn.com.
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.800]   Well, Pastor John calls the experience of discouragement,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.720]   quote, "Typical Christian life."
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.140]   Typical Christian life, typical.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.900]   Being discouraged is more normal than abnormal.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.700]   But when we find ourselves stuck in discouragement,
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.760]   can we get ourselves unstuck?
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:37.960]   We can.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.400]   And the Bible gives us a strategy for how to do it.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   Pastor John will explain it next time.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.020]   Welcome to 2023.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.960]   And we will see you on Wednesday.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:04.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
