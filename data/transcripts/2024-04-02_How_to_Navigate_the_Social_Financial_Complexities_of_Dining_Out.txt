[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.800]   skills, insights, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.320]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.960]   and today on the podcast, I want to give you some dining etiquette, help you save a little
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.600]   bit of money when you go out to eat. But first, we begin with a story.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.880]   So I get invited via my homegirl to go to this girl's dinner. I don't know her like that. I
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.680]   think I met her once through my homegirl a while ago, but I was like, "You know what? I'm going to
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.680]   go because you're inviting me." So I go, I get the girl a little gift or whatever. When I pull up,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   the first thing I realize is, first of all, everybody's on time. And second of all, a lot
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.960]   of people showed up for this girl's birthday dinner. It was over 12 people, probably over 15.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.720]   I never seen this many people at a birthday dinner at a restaurant in my life. As the night's going,
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   people are buying their drinks and things like that. But what I started noticing is
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   people's orders. I'm a very observant person, so I started noticing people's orders. And people,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.440]   they was ordering two and three appetizers, three and four drinks, the best, biggest T-bone steaks
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.200]   with the gold on it, and this, and truffle fries, and this, and this. Everybody was doing their
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.920]   thing. So something, I don't know what it was, at some point of the night after people was finishing
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.560]   up their plates and ordering their last drinks and stuff like that, I had to go to the bathroom.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.720]   But something hit me on my way to the bathroom, like, "You know, just stop and pay for your meal.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.040]   Just stop by the bar, pay for your meal, tip out, do that." That's what I did.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.040]   So by the time I go to the bathroom, pay for my bill, tip out, stuff like that, the waiter is
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.720]   coming around to the table wanting to know how we're going to do the bill because the bill can
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   only get split two ways. And he made that very clear. The bill can only get split two ways.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.400]   So the girl looks down at the other end of the table where we're sitting and she says,
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.600]   "Oh, well, two of the guests, they can put it on their card and everybody can cash at them.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.560]   And they can deal with the bill because I'm not worried about that. I'm the birthday girl."
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.360]   I heard it, but everybody around at the table act like they didn't. And I was completely not
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.200]   worried because again, my bill is paid for, tipped and everything. I'm just kind of waiting
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.440]   on my home girl. So after time has gone past, nobody's putting up the card. Nobody even touched
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.240]   the check. So finally, a dude that was there, he opened it being funny and it was over $3,500.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.040]   That's how much the bill was. It was over $3,500. When he said that, I just busted out laughing.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120]   I don't know why I find it to be so funny. I think it's because I knew it was about to be
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.760]   a shit show. So the person comes back around and notice that nobody's touching the bill and it's
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.880]   like, "Hey, what are we doing about the bill?" So she looked down towards our end again, which I
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   don't know why she kept looking down towards our end. So finally, she's like, "All right,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.200]   well, who's going to put down on the bill?" So I don't say nothing. My home girl, she don't say
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.120]   nothing. And then so finally, another girl in the group was like, "Well, my home girl, well,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.200]   can we put it on your card and everybody just pay you back?" My home girl, she say, "No."
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.960]   Like, "No, I'm not really comfortable with that." So things are starting to get heated now. There's
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.600]   a back and forth going between the restaurant, who's going to be paying, things like that.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   A lot of people are getting frustrated. Things are getting heated. So what do I do?
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.720]   I say, "I'm going to excuse myself." Because first of all, I'm not about to be sitting in a food,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.320]   restaurant, public setting and embarrass myself because y'all don't have your shit together,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   right? I don't do that. I don't play that. My is already taken care of. My bill is taken care of,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.800]   tipped out, tipped beautifully. My bill came up to a hundred, and I'll never forget,
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.880]   it was $115 without tip, right? So I was like, "I'm going to excuse myself."
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.840]   Get up, leave, call the Uber and all. My home girl, because this is her friend. So she's staying,
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.200]   trying to figure things out, stuff like that, arguing, things like that with people. I'm not
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.480]   doing that. So I excuse myself and I leave because y'all need to figure this out. As I'm getting up
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.240]   to leave, "Well, what are you doing? How are you leaving? You need to help pay for this bill,"
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   things like that. The waiter, before I can even say that, the waiter's like,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.800]   "His bill's already taken care of. He paid his bill and tipped out almost 45 minutes ago."
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.520]   Everybody's shocked, looking like, "I'm hitting the door by now. I'm gone. I'm out."
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.320]   By the time I get home, about an hour, I would say, later, I get a long text message from my
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.760]   home girl. "I think that it was real rude what you did at my home girl's birthday dinner.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.960]   I don't know where that kind of etiquette came from." I texted her back a simple, "IDC."
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.480]   So how's that for a story? I don't know who to attribute that story to. I just heard it online
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.840]   and I couldn't find the original guy who was recording it. But it's one of those things that
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.720]   if it hasn't happened to you, I promise it will happen to you. I thought this is an important
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.160]   topic. Dining etiquette is an important topic for us to talk about. I want to talk about it because
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.640]   it applies differently at different stages of life. I want to give you some tools that I have
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   developed over many years that have helped me to be able to navigate this a little bit more simply.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.320]   First, this show will probably be most helpful to younger listeners. So if you've got teens or
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.160]   if you're a young man or young woman, I hope that this show will help you because it takes a little
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.480]   while to figure these things out. Once you go through the school of hard knocks and you have
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.200]   some weird checks that don't quite split the way they do and you navigate some awkward situations,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.000]   then things get a little different. So I'll just share with you a little bit of what I have learned
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.880]   in terms of appropriate etiquette, because the etiquette does change depending on the stage of
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.160]   life you're in. I remember when I first started dining out was a teenager in high school, and
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   I was in various after-school activities, evening activities, and you go out with your friends and
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.560]   go out to the local restaurant. And the dining etiquette in that circumstance is pretty
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:34.720]   straightforward. You pay for what you order. However, as you start to get older, then the
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.400]   dining etiquette changes and you get into splitting checks, you get into picking up the tab as your
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.280]   wealth increases. And then I've found even with having a large family, the dining etiquette
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.880]   changes quite a lot, that now there's a different expectation. So let's talk through these things
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.960]   and share with you some ideas. The first thing that you want to do in order to avoid difficult
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:04.400]   situations is you want to communicate clearly and you want to know upfront what you're getting into.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.320]   One of the things that is often difficult for young people to do is to practice assertiveness
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.760]   with regard to money. And assertiveness means simply being open, honest, and forthright about
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:25.200]   what you are able to afford and what you are not able to afford. Every single time that I myself
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.360]   have gotten into a financial jam over a meal, and of course, here we're talking about a restaurant
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.200]   meal, it's because I didn't clarify it in advance. And there are a couple of levels
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.360]   of clarification to pay attention to. First, before you accept an invitation to dinner,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.400]   it's a good idea to have a sense of what you're getting into. There's a big difference between
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.360]   you're going out to dinner at the local diner where your maximum check might be, I don't know,
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.120]   $20 with everything included, as compared to going out to a luxury restaurant where your
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.360]   maximum check can be hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of dollars. In general, you're going to
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:13.040]   have an idea of what kind of restaurant you're eating at just based upon what you're accustomed
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.080]   to. If you're in small town USA versus downtown Manhattan, you're going to have a different set
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.160]   of prices. So you're going to have a good idea based upon general knowledge, but it's always
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.000]   a good idea to check the menu. And in today's world, that has gotten a lot easier to do.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.760]   So what I'll usually do is before accepting a restaurant invitation, if I'm uncertain about it,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:41.280]   I'll check the menu either on the website of the restaurant or Google and Apple Maps,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.360]   both of these and other platforms as well, Yelp as well, will have a quick estimate on prices.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   And so you can check a few Google reviews, a few Yelp reviews on a restaurant, get an idea of what
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.040]   your price is likely to be. And you should have in your mind a good general sense of what you're
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   trying to spend on a meal. And then you'll multiply that by, of course, the number of people in your
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   party. This is one of those things where I have found, as my family has grown, this has become
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.440]   more important to me because it makes a bigger difference in the size of my check.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.760]   If you are a single individual going out to dinner, the difference between, say,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   a $20 check and a $40 check is only $20. It's not that big of a deal. If you're a family of seven
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.160]   going out to dinner, then the difference between a $20 check and a $40 check winds up being a
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.640]   difference of, say, about $150. And so it can be a much bigger impact on your budget if you are
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   unprepared for it. So whenever possible, it's a good idea to get a good sense of what the menu
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:54.960]   price is going to be for your food. And if the menu price is out of your league, it's unaffordable
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.160]   for you, then simply say something. Generally speaking, when you're going out to dinner with
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.640]   people where there's a little negotiation about where we're going to go, if you just say something,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.400]   it will fix the problem. And a lot of times we don't like to say something because we don't want
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.520]   to be the person who is somehow broke. We don't want to be the person who says, "I can't afford
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.600]   it. I don't have any money." That harms our self-image in some way. But what I want to
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.200]   encourage you is to simply recognize that even if you're with somebody who is very wealthy,
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:32.000]   most people who are wealthy have become wealthy themselves, at least in the U.S.-American context
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   where intergenerational wealth is much less common. Many people who are mega millionaires
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   and billionaires remember what it was like when they were working for minimum wage jobs. And so
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.680]   it's not a sign of weakness to say, "That's not in my budget," or "I don't have the money for
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:56.080]   that," or "Can we choose a place that is less expensive?" It's purely a sign of confidence
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.160]   that simply say where you're at. And the point of going out to dinner with somebody,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:08.720]   generally speaking, is to find a solution to your meal where you're going to have a great
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.760]   experience. And if you're fretting about the bill the entire time that you're sitting there,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.480]   you're not going to have a great experience. And so it's good to speak up. And if you speak up in
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.080]   advance and you communicate, then in many cases, somebody will say, "Hey, it's my treat. It's no
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.400]   problem." And I think that if you find yourself as the person with more money, I think one of the
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.040]   best things that you can do is make this accessible for people. More on that in a moment.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.360]   So first of all, you want to take a look at the menu, but you also then need to recognize that
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.080]   the price on the menu is not your final price. If you're young and you haven't dined out a lot,
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.880]   or maybe you're newly moving to a place like the United States where service charges are not
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.120]   generally included in the bill, taxes are generally not included in the bill, you find yourself
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.360]   surprised by a meal that costs 30 to 40 percent more than the number that's written on the menu.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.280]   So you should think about that and be aware of that. For my European listeners, or basically
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.520]   from everywhere except the United States and Canada, what you need to understand is that
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.120]   if you are dining out in North America, generally speaking, there's going to be a tax that is added
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.240]   to your bill. That tax will vary based upon the city and the state. It's going to include a sales
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   tax. But in many cases, a 10 percent increase is kind of fairly normal. Again, it may be 6 percent,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.640]   it may be 8 percent, but by the time you put it all together, 10 percent is a very normal amount
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:40.400]   of tax. So if your entree is $15, plan on it actually costing with tax $16.50. Then you need
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.040]   to plan on your service charge. And some restaurants will include a service charge,
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.960]   but they'll often include a service charge if there's a large group. But the expectation in
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.800]   the North American culture is that your service charge is that you pay your tip, and that that
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.440]   is something that you decide on the ultimate amount as long as it's 20 percent. You can tip
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:08.560]   less, but generally speaking, in today's world, tipping 20 percent is a normal tip. We could talk
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.600]   separately about how tipping culture in the United States has gotten out of hand, how crazy it is,
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   but it is what it is. We're not going to change it. And it's my basic worldview that if something
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.200]   is culturally expected, I want to be a gracious member of the culture. I don't want to be
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.960]   a rude iconoclast. It's fine to be an iconoclast if I can do it without harming other people,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.440]   but I want to be a gracious person in the culture, fit in well, encourage my fellow citizens. And so
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.400]   if I'm going to go out to dinner at a place that has a tipping charge included, then I'm going to
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.160]   make sure that I plan for that and prepare for that. Which leads me to the next piece of advice.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:57.520]   If you, in thinking about the details prior to going out to dinner, find yourself looking at a
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.440]   charge or a menu that is beyond your reach, one of the first things that you can do is pull back
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.320]   on the location and choose a place that doesn't include a service charge. This is something that
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.200]   I myself will do some, not frequently, but I do get so annoyed with the tipping culture and the
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.320]   expectations because I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place that either I
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.240]   tip a full amount and generously, and since I'm not willing to not be a generous tipper,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.280]   I will often choose places that don't include a tipping culture. And so that's one thing that you
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.840]   can often do. If you find yourself looking at a menu and you recognize that the taxes and the tip
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:39.520]   are going to make this particular dining experience out of your reach, then go ahead and just choose
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.680]   a different venue. Choose a restaurant where you don't have table service. Choose a restaurant
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.280]   that doesn't impose those charges. And there are plenty of restaurants available today
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.200]   that don't impose table service charges, either, again, through just simple tips,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.880]   that will give you a great experience. I love Chipotle. I find Chipotle, as an example,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:09.680]   to be one of those restaurants that has broadly universal appeal, is widely available, and has
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.400]   something to please most people. There are a lot of other versions of these, places that are salad
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.040]   restaurants or salad bowl restaurants, people kind of riffing on this. And I think these work
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.000]   really well because they split the categories of dining. They're certainly not fine dining.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.800]   And so if you are in the mood to go out for a fine dining experience, then don't choose one
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:38.000]   of these places. But they work really well for social events because each person can do what he
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.720]   or she wants at the restaurant, order his or her own food exactly as desired, take care of your
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   own bill. All these things can be done separately, and you don't have to intermingle them all the
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.800]   way that you do when you're in a table service environment. So what I would suggest is be
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.560]   thoughtful about the places that you commit to going, and be assertive. If a place is suggested
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.320]   to you that is beyond your financial reach, just simply say so, and choose a different place. There
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:14.640]   are an abundance of options available for all people that will allow you to enjoy a dining
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:22.960]   experience with others that isn't going to bust your budget. Next, prior to going out to eat,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:29.280]   do your best to determine how the bill itself is actually going to be paid.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.480]   Now, there's a little bit of social grace here that is necessary, because in many dining
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:43.200]   situations, you will go out to eat with somebody, and you don't want to pre-negotiate who's going
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.960]   to pay the bill because your dining partner may wish to be generous and say, "Hey, I've got the
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.640]   bill," but he doesn't want to do it in advance. He wants to do it at the end of the meal.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:17:00.400]   And so in many cases, that's what you should expect. However, if there is uncertainty in your
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:06.880]   ability to go out to eat, then I think it's wise for you to pre-negotiate how the bill is going
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.440]   to be settled. And I want to give you a couple of suggestions on how to do that. But first,
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:18.240]   let's talk about how to handle it if everything is normal, you're going out to dinner in a
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:25.200]   restaurant where everyone is together, as, say, a mature man. In general, I think there are two
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.520]   acceptable ways, socially acceptable ways, to split the check. The first is for one person
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:38.640]   to pay the entire check. The second is for it to be split evenly. As a man, those are basically
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:46.240]   the only two acceptable ways to split a bill. The negotiation and the careful calculations that you
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.600]   do in high school and college and when you're young and somewhat broke, those things need to
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.680]   pretty quickly disappear in most social cultures. There may be exceptions. I don't know what the
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.920]   dining culture is like in your homeland. Perhaps there are exceptions. So I'm just speaking broadly
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:09.840]   to middle-class U.S. American culture, which is the culture that I myself know. But in middle-class
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.880]   U.S. American culture, basically, either you pick up the bill for everyone at the table and you
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.840]   don't worry about any nickel and dime calculations, or each person tosses in evenly for the check.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.240]   The check is 100 bucks and there's four people. Each person kicks in $25 and it's just split.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:36.960]   There are exceptions to this in some other parts of the world, depending on how the restaurants
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.640]   actually do the point-of-service terminals. And forgive me for all the international discussion,
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.360]   but I think it's helpful because I have a large international audience that sometimes goes to
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.280]   the United States and then vice versa, because I think this is where things will go in the United
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:58.560]   States. In the United States, the way that bills are normally managed is that the server will bring
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:05.440]   the check to your table and you have two choices. Either you pay with a card or you pay with cash.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.960]   And when you pay with cash, you can get change, but customarily, you often just
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.840]   leave enough cash to cover the tip. You stand up and you walk out. And then if you're going to pay
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:23.120]   with a card, frequently, the server will take the card back to the kitchen and charge it there or at
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:29.120]   the central pay station where all the cards are processed. This is different than in many other
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.440]   places in the world. In most places in the world, at least that I have been, that are outside of the
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.320]   United States and Canada, the server will bring now the card terminal to your table and you'll
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.800]   actually run your card at the table. This is a superior model because it protects against the
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:51.840]   theft of your card. One way that somebody can steal your financial information is if they're
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.720]   in possession of your physical credit card, they can just simply run the magnetic strip through a
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.000]   reader, save that information, clone the card, and then steal your credit card information.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.960]   There are a lot of thefts that can happen this way. So if you're dealing with an unethical criminal
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.120]   who's working in a restaurant, that criminal can quickly get a hold of a lot of credit card
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.480]   information, which can then be used for fraudulent purchases. So it's better for you to maintain
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.080]   access to the physical credit card itself. And the way that's done is if the POS terminal,
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.600]   the point of service terminal, the pay machine is brought to your table. Now, one innovation that
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.800]   has happened, and by the way, I think within a decade, that'll be the common thing in the United
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.880]   States as well. And the reason is due to the broad spreading of Apple Pay and Google Pay.
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   Now that Apple Pay and Google Pay and contactless credit cards are becoming ubiquitous in the United
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:54.800]   States, as they have been in many places in the world, now that that is the case, then increasingly
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.720]   the server is bringing the terminal to the table in the United States. And I'm already seeing that
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.600]   change happen in the country, and I think it's an inevitable change because logically it makes sense
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.200]   and it allows people to use their contactless payment systems. However, it's not yet universal.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:15.280]   So there is still this culture of sending the card back. The reason this matters is that
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:22.240]   traditionally it's difficult and annoying for a server to split credit card transactions across
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.480]   many cards. And so because of the strong cash culture in the United States, then there were
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.680]   rules about, "Oh, we'll only accept a certain number of cards." That's what you heard in the
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.640]   story that I played for you. "We'll take two credit cards for this $3,500 bill. We'll split it two
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.960]   ways. You just tell us how much you want on the card." And that's hard when you have a table where
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.440]   you have a dozen people all ordering different amounts, you have bringing bottles of wine for
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.080]   the table, and all the transactions are starting to get mixed and mingled. That's difficult.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:58.400]   But what I'm seeing more and more is that as restaurants around the world are using an
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.920]   electronic ordering system, that it's really nicely integrated with the payment system.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.960]   And this works really beautifully. You'll go out to a restaurant, and frequently I was out
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:16.480]   to dinner with half a dozen guys, and each one wanted to pay for our bill. And so all the waiter
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.920]   did was take the long list of things, flip it from one side of the tablet to the other, and then hit
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.880]   process. And at the end of it, the whole list of orders for the whole table was handled individually
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.400]   with individual card transactions. And that, I think, is where a lot of these terminals will
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.040]   eventually go. But it's not ubiquitous yet. So you still have this kind of awkwardness that's
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.920]   associated with it. So you need to plan ahead and be prepared for this. So if you're going to be
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:49.120]   going to a restaurant where splitting the bill evenly is going to be difficult for you, in many
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.960]   cases, you should just clarify quickly how the bill is going to be settled. And if you can do
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:01.440]   that in advance, it will increase your confidence of going out. So you would say something, somebody
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.600]   invites you to dinner, and you would say, "Hey, that's great. Do you have any sense of how much
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.040]   it is?" If you don't know, and the person will say, "Oh, no, no, I got it. It's my treat." And
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.360]   then you'll know going in that you're going to be treated to dinner. What you don't want to do is
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.840]   get yourself in a situation where you don't enjoy the meal because you're worried about how the bill
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.240]   is going to be settled at the end of it because of this social awkwardness because you weren't
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.600]   willing to clarify things in advance. Now, if you are hosting, one of the things that you can do
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   is try to make things simpler by clarifying in advance as the host. So if I'm going to
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:47.760]   invite someone to a meal, generally speaking, I will do my best to make it clear that either I'm
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.800]   going to treat or you're going to pay. And what I do, and there may be more elegant ways, but if I
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.120]   am going to treat someone to dinner, then I'm going to specifically say, "Hey, it's my treat.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.800]   I would love for you guys to come. It'll be my treat. I'd love to treat you." That way,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   someone can come with a free heart, not have to go back and think about, "Can I afford this or
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.080]   can I not afford this?" If I'm not going to treat someone, then I'll try to give them an indication
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.520]   of how much the bill will cost. And of course, this is something that you'll do based upon some
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:26.000]   knowledge of a person's finances. If you are inviting someone that you know is wealthy,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.920]   always eating out, has plenty of money to spend on discretionary expenses like that,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.000]   then I don't think you need to do that. But if I'm inviting somebody out for a meal and I'm not
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   willing to treat them for a meal, but I want to have a dining experience with them, then I'll
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.400]   just give them an indication of the budget and say, "Hey, does that work for you?" So it would
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.840]   go something like, "My family and I are going to go and have lunch after church. We're going to go
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.480]   to this restaurant. Would you guys like to join us? We'd love for you to join us. We really love
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.640]   this restaurant. It has this kind of food. I find that the cost is, say, it winds up coming out at
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.680]   15 bucks a person," something like that. "Does that work for you or do you want to pick somewhere
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:08.800]   else?" And so something like that, where you try to express the social grace of allowing somebody
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:15.520]   to choose based upon food preferences or money, I think works really well. So you want to give
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.360]   someone a gracious way out. So they don't have to say, "No, I can't afford $15." You can say,
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.960]   "You know what? I would prefer a different kind of food." Great. Here are some options and kind
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.400]   of work those things out. But by being clear about the cost up front, you're making it evident that
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:34.000]   we're going to go out to the meal together and you're going to be expected to pay for your
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.640]   family. I'll pay for my family. We're going to split the checks. So that's an important thing
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.000]   to do in advance if possible, just to alleviate any pressure for somebody who may not be as wealthy
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.160]   as you are if you're not going to treat them. The other time to do this is simply when you
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.320]   get to the restaurant. And if you know that we're going to a restaurant and my budget is not going
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:04.000]   to allow me to pay for the table, then your assertiveness needs to come in by simply saying
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.120]   at the beginning to the waiter, "Hey, I'd like to have separate checks, please. I'm going to cover
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   this person, this person, this person, this person. I'm going to order for everyone." And
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.680]   get your separate checks set up in advance. When you do it in advance, generally that's pretty
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.120]   simple for the server to have multiple checks set up and it solves problems with, "Oh, I can't take
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.640]   so many credit cards." So do that also. And if you do it, it makes it clear to everyone at the
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:33.680]   table that I'm not treating you, but I'm also not a burden on you. And then if somebody was planning
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.600]   on treating, then he can kick in and say, "No, I got it. I got it." And you can go ahead and have
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.720]   your negotiation right then and there. That's a helpful technique. And if you will exercise it,
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:51.440]   you'll find it useful. On the flip side, one of the things that you can do if it's socially
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.760]   uncomfortable to do any of those things, then you just simply need to come prepared for the meal.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.920]   And I think that the best way to do that is to always travel with cash in your pocket,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:11.760]   physical currency. The annoyances with settling the bill often come in related to cards. So we
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:17.840]   all love to spend on our cards. We love that it makes it easy and simple for us. And we're all
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.960]   grateful that, "Hey, you can Venmo me this. You can cash out me that much." But the problem is
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.120]   that it turns into an enormous math problem at the table for people to sit down and negotiate
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:35.920]   their amounts. And if you've got to have a card in the mix, then there's a good chance that you're
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:41.120]   going to come out in someplace different than you should be. So I remember this happened all the
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.160]   time. When I was in high school, I started to face this. And I was fairly frugal because I didn't
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:52.400]   have any money. And the simple things where I'd go out to dinner, and at that time, socially,
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:58.160]   in your lifespan, socially speaking, it's appropriate for you to split the check based
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:03.440]   upon actual consumption. And so I would go out, and I wouldn't order the dessert, and I wouldn't
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:09.200]   order the drink. I would just get a simple entree, an inexpensive entree that was what I could
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:15.120]   afford. And yet I would always wind up overpaying because it would just never work out. And so I
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.960]   developed the habit of always having cash in my pocket, because it solves the situation beautifully.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   And that is still something that I do today. If I'm going to go out to dinner with a large group
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:32.400]   of people, and I was invited, but it was not obvious that I was being treated, that someone
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:38.080]   else was paying the bill, then when I show up at dinner, I'm going to have cash in my pocket to pay
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.880]   for the dinner. And also importantly, I'm going to have cash in my pocket that's not going to require
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:49.680]   me to come with precise change, with an exact... I don't need to get change. And so I'll have a
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:56.960]   selection of 50s, 100s, 20s, 10s, whatever is necessary, and 5s, so that I can tabulate my own
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:02.880]   cost of the check, and plus tip, plus service charge, all of that, add in a little extra,
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.840]   so that there's no question. I can lay my cash on the table and sit back and let other people work
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.400]   it out. Where you don't want to be is in the situation that guy was in in the story, is you
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   don't want to be in a situation where you're arguing and negotiating with people, and whose
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.480]   credit card is it going to go on. Because if you haven't learned that the hard way, there are people
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.960]   who you'll wind up in a mixed group with out to dinner with 8 or 10 or 12 people, you don't know
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.200]   three of the other people, and all of a sudden you'll have a bill on your credit card that you
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:38.480]   can't afford and wasn't in your budget. And so what is always appropriate and always protects you
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.520]   is simply to have physical currency, because that allows you to always pay for your bill,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:49.040]   to pay for what you paid for, but you don't have to be involved in the bottles of wine that they
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.480]   ordered. You don't have to be involved in the extravagant purchases that they made,
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:30:01.680]   but so you've solved your ethical obligation to pay the bill as well as your just practical
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.760]   consideration. You don't have to say, "Well, put it on my card," and the server says, "We only take
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:13.200]   two cards." Well, no problem. Here's cash. You're good to go. So make that as a habit. If you don't
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:22.080]   customarily carry physical currency, then I would suggest to you this is reason number 1463 as to
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:28.000]   why physical currency is useful, and always have enough physical currency with you in the appropriate
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.080]   denominations that you can settle the bill. By the way, this is also something that I find very
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:40.400]   useful when traveling, is that whenever I'm traveling, I'm always worried that my bank is
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.560]   going to shut off my credit cards, and they're just not going to work, and yet I don't always
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.400]   want to get local currency, and so I always will travel with a variety of U.S. dollars,
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.440]   because I can pay a bill in any country in the world with U.S. dollars as long as I round up a
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.680]   little bit, and the rounding up that you do to pay with U.S. dollars is always going to be cheaper
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   than dealing with the change fees and the leftover currency if you wind up in a situation. So develop
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   the habit of carrying cash with you. Then as you progress in life, you'll need to move on to the
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.960]   next stage of finances. So far, I've been thinking about somebody who doesn't have much money,
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:25.680]   somebody who's building their assets, and you want to engage in financial considerations,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.960]   but now how do you move on to being the one to basically having an adult financial life,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.400]   where now you're the one, when you make an invitation, you can treat other people?
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:41.280]   And it's not so much about the specifics of settling the bill, but it's again where these
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.640]   same principles come into play. First of all, I think that those of us who are older,
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.760]   we should help younger people to understand these etiquette rules through practice,
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.840]   and one of the ways that we can help younger generations enormously is simply to do small
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:06.400]   things like paying for their food. I recently was out to a meal with a friend of mine who was a
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:14.000]   lifelong friend. I met him when I was a very young teenager, and this man must have treated me to a
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   restaurant 100 or 200 times, been a good friend of mine for a very long time. And every time I see
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:28.000]   him, I try to affirm to him how much I appreciate his generosity towards me, because it made a big
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.200]   difference in my life as a young man, as a teenager, college student, all through, because
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.000]   he would take me to places that I wouldn't have been able to afford, and I would show up and drink
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.760]   water, but he would be happy to pay the bill. And it was incredibly generous of him, and he really
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.080]   invested into my life, and he was a valuable mentor for me because of that. And I want to be
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.880]   the man who pays it forward to other generations as well. And so, I think that these same principles
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.800]   apply, that when you're choosing a place to go out to eat, you should choose a place in which you
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.560]   can treat people, and look for an opportunity where it's comfortable for you to treat other
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.160]   people, if at all possible, and take away some of these social challenges for them. Paying for
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.920]   the pleasure of people's company is a very good use of money, in my opinion. It's the thing that
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:28.640]   I would rather spend money on more than almost anything. If I can spend money and get a time of
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:34.880]   socializing out of it, to me, that's a really worthy investment, and it's worth spending money.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.320]   A couple of thoughts for you, if you're in the situation. Just a quick story as we transition
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:47.600]   here. When I was a financial advisor, I did quite a lot of eating out, did quite a lot of
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   entertaining. I don't think that that's always a good business move, but I had to learn the hard
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:34:01.040]   way how to do it. And it can be quite financially difficult to do a lot of hosting, especially when
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.800]   the money is coming out of your pocket. If you've got a corporate expense account that's allocated
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.240]   for client meals and entertainment, and you know the budget amount, great. I didn't. I had Joshua's
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.040]   bank account that was allocated for meals and entertainment, and I had to figure out how do I
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:22.080]   make money with this in the long run. And I found it very uncomfortable, because meals are usually a
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.920]   social experience. They're not necessarily a money-making experience, and they're clearly
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:33.520]   important, but they're also not – there's not a direct response. It's not a "I'm going to get
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.440]   the deal because I take this guy out for lunch." And there was a time in my career in which I would
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.880]   often host people three meals a day. In some cases, I had two lunch appointments, an early one and a
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:49.520]   late one, and a breakfast appointment, and all of these things. I later dumped a lot of that stuff,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.840]   and I realized that I was taking prospective clients to meals because I was uncomfortable
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:02.160]   getting straight to business. And I learned that as I grew in my maturity that it was actually
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:07.840]   better for me just to get straight to business. And then after a business relationship developed,
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.760]   then we would go ahead and add a social relationship in, because the flip side was a
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.600]   very expensive way of sometimes, only sometimes, getting to business. But all of that entertaining
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:24.160]   meant that in order for me to fit my budget, I had to find some options. And let me explain to you
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.920]   what I ultimately settled on that I think is a good solution. First, you are never going to have
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:39.760]   the world's biggest client expense account. And so, your goal in hosting people or treating people
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:46.400]   to a meal is not to spend the most money. In fact, just because you could spend the most money
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.600]   doesn't even make it a socially appropriate thing. It's kind of gauche. It's kind of
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:55.040]   icky just to show off that, "Look, I can spend more money than anyone else can." Of course,
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.840]   in many circumstances, people enjoy it when a deep-pocketed patron can host them for a lovely
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:07.120]   event that they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. But it's not necessary in many cases.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:14.000]   And so, I found that when I was a financial advisor, first, my rule was I have to pay because
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.400]   I'm inviting people for lunch. I'm going to pay. So, how do I figure this out? If we've got
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.480]   a hundred-dollar lunch and I've got one of those in the morning and another one in the early
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.200]   afternoon, and all of a sudden, I've got huge amounts of money going out, that's not appropriate.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:34.800]   So, what I've always looked for is I've always looked for a non-category-conforming experience
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.240]   that you can have with people. And if you'll look for this, I think this can, in many ways,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:48.880]   be a good fit for you. So, my favorite place that I found was I found this amazing Mexican
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:56.640]   burrito joint in my city. And it was a client who introduced me to it. It was right behind the
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:07.120]   fancy plaza with all the nice places and all of the $40 meal places that would be kind of normal.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:13.920]   But right behind there on the industrial alleyway was this little tiny hole-in-the-wall Mexican
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:23.600]   joint that basically exclusively had construction workers in it. And all the patrons were Mexican
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:30.320]   guys and construction workers in high-vis clothing. And yet, they made amazing burritos.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.760]   It was a really, really great spot. And so, that became my go-to lunch spot because it was
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.280]   different. It was an experience that was different than a lot of people would ever have. And I would
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.800]   invite fancy people in fancy clothes. We would go in there and toss our jackets off and roll up our
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:53.360]   sleeves and loosen our ties and really enjoy amazing food that solved the problem of having
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   a really great meal, but without breaking the bank. And what you should do is, if you're going
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.000]   to do a lot of entertaining, you should look for a variety of options. And if you're going to do a
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.320]   lot of entertaining and you're trying to manage your budget, is look for a variety of options
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:16.000]   that fit that. Look for something that's not the category shifter. I would pay at the burrito joint,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.200]   I would pay the same amount of money as you would pay for a fast food meal at a big fast
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.440]   food franchise. But the experience was something that people loved because it was very different.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:35.360]   And you can do this in any number of ways. And so, if you are taking girls out on dates,
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:41.520]   or if you're taking clients out to lunch, or you're treating people for dinner,
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.520]   look for circumstances and ways that allow you to get the essence of what you want,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.160]   which is a meal together, but also allows you to provide those additional benefits, a fun time,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.800]   an out of the ordinary experience, and doesn't do it in an expensive way that's going to cause you
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.600]   to be stressed about money. Spending a lot of money on somebody, whether it's a date, whether
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.800]   it's a business prospect, whether it's a friend, spending a lot of money is the most mundane and
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   tiresome thing that someone can do. And yeah, it's appreciated, sure. But giving somebody an
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.080]   experience is something that really stands out. And this is a skill that you can develop. You
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:26.560]   don't need to spend lots of money on people to impress them. To the extent that you impress
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.320]   them, you often create freeloaders. And they'll be your professional dinner companion as long as you
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.480]   pay. But if you give people an experience that's different, that's out of the ordinary, but that's
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:44.400]   genuinely really nice, then you can have a much better situation. And this is useful at every
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.600]   stage. When my wife and I, before we were engaged, before we were married, we did this a lot.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:55.360]   And I looked for chances for us to spend time together in memorable ways, create interesting
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.320]   memories. And when you put constraints on your money, you often create better memories.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:07.520]   When you are going out with business clients, same thing as I'm describing to you,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.720]   find something that you really like that's out of the ordinary and create an experience
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:16.560]   that you can treat people for that's not just a matter of spending lots of money.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.800]   And then as you move into the family stage of meals and events, a similar thing happens.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:30.560]   I've found it interesting how the etiquette of dining and the money involved has changed as I
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.160]   have had more children. There were various people who used to treat me when it was me and my wife,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.480]   and we had one or two children. There were people in our lives who would treat us. But now,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.240]   it's kind of funny, they'll take us out to dinner and it's like they have a dollar amount that
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:52.320]   they're not willing to go over. And so it creates this weird environment where somehow their idea of
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:59.440]   a good time is to invite Joshua and his family out to dinner. And yet the idea is that they're
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.280]   a family of three and they're going to pay for a family of three and pay for, say, one or two extra
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.400]   meals. "Hey, I'll treat you with X amount of dollars." And then Joshua needs to pay for all
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:17.760]   seven of his family members. And it creates this unique socially weird situation where there's an
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:25.600]   expectation that the person with a large family should say yes. But again, and I don't fault
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.440]   anybody for it, it just means it's another thing where you have to figure out how to navigate your
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.280]   way through it with grace and ease to make everyone comfortable, and yet for things to work.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:40.800]   I take my family out to dinner, far more than almost anybody that I know, but I often don't
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.960]   enjoy it. It's not a great environment. And so once again, you can find a creative solution.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.920]   And so I would imagine most people with many children, they do kind of what I do, where you
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:57.600]   say, "Hey, listen, let's do this. Instead of going out to the restaurant, I'll go pick up a bunch of
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.560]   subs for everyone and we'll meet in the local park where we can visit together there. Or let's go to
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.840]   the pond. Let's go to a place that we can play." And what you'll find is, once again, I can easily
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:15.920]   cover most people's expenses in a much easier way without going out to a restaurant and yet have a
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.520]   better experience for everyone involved, more freedom, more time of connection, more enjoyment
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:29.120]   together. The last comment on this simple experiences discussion is, remember that as
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:38.640]   the number of people in a dinner party grows, the economies of scale change significantly.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:45.680]   So let's use number of people example. If you and I are going to go out to dinner or go out to lunch
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.560]   or go out to dinner, the two of us, it's almost certainly best for us to simply go to a restaurant,
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:56.480]   spend time at the restaurant, enjoy each other's company, pay for our restaurant meal and leave.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:02.000]   Because the margins, especially if we're talking about food, restaurants don't have a lot of margin
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.160]   on food. And so the value per calorie or the value per minute or whatever you want to calculate it,
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.040]   of that experience is very, very high. One person to go out to a restaurant is a really great
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:23.520]   move. The numbers work really well and it just makes a lot of sense. However, if we are a party
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.320]   of eight people and we're going to go out to a restaurant, then all of a sudden now all of the
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:35.520]   financial calculations change. The cost of going out to the restaurant increases substantially
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:44.080]   and the value is the same as what it was in terms of the value per minute. But now with that higher
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.680]   dollar amount, we can adjust into different settings. Lest that be too ethereal, let's use
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:56.640]   some examples. If I'm going to go out with my family, we go out, we're seven people, for the
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:07.120]   price of us going out to a restaurant where we're going to order seven entrees plus extras, which
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.640]   in some cases means we're going to go to a mid-level mediocre restaurant that's not a great
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:21.840]   dining experience, we can feed a group three times as big as ours all out of our own pocket with
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:27.840]   steak and lobster for the same price because of the economies of scale of doing it ourselves.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:33.760]   And so if you have a large group, as in your family or other large group mechanisms,
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.920]   then what I think makes the most sense is for you to start to bring the experience that you get
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   in a restaurant into your home. And so instead of spending constantly huge amounts of money,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.520]   taking lots of other people out to restaurants, which is mundane and kind of normal, not very
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:59.200]   memorable, a lot of times annoying, can't control it, rather use your home to control the environment
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.400]   so that you can have a more memorable experience for people. And you can do this at the very modest
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   financial cost, or you can do this at a higher end cost and create a very memorable experience.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:16.400]   So if you're a family with modest resources, just develop a few basic recipes, a few basic menus
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:22.640]   that you enjoy using when you're entertaining, and develop a simple but welcoming atmosphere,
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.280]   have people into your home, have a few meals that you really enjoy that are crowd pleasers,
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:35.040]   and treat everyone in that context. We've, in our current world, it seems as though very few of us
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.960]   open up our homes to other people. And it means we go out to these restaurants and have everything
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.440]   that's associated with that, but we don't get the genuine connection that can come when you're in
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:48.960]   the context of someone's home. And so you can develop this with your own, and do it really
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:54.480]   nicely with all of the money that you would spend on a restaurant and provide a much better
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:00.160]   experience. You can have a multiple course dinner. Some things that we've enjoyed doing is develop
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:07.120]   something like a simple crowd pleaser for a little snack. Maybe you do a little charcuterie board,
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:12.640]   some crackers and cheese, some kind of special thing that you do. You might develop a couple
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.800]   of cocktails that you create. If you have a home bar and you like to make cocktails, develop a
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.600]   couple of signature cocktails that you really enjoy making, offer those to your guests, or
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:27.280]   something that is unique to your area, a special local drink or a special local flavor, and offer
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.640]   those to your guests, have a nice dinner, develop, finish it off with a nice dessert. And a lot of
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:38.160]   people are really starved for that kind of in-home experience. And then train your children as you're
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:44.000]   able to, to provide a good experience. You'll have a lot better success teaching social skills in your
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.840]   own home, where your children learn to interact with your guests, they get to listen to the
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.400]   stories of your guests, and you don't have all the hustle and bustle of a restaurant.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.280]   Now, at the higher end, if you're going to host a dinner party of eight or 10 people,
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:05.600]   consider just hosting and hiring a private chef to cook for you. Consider doing, I don't have any
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.560]   more examples, just have a private chef. Hire a chef to come in and cook for you in your home
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.200]   for the evening, maybe hire a bartender or whatever you need to do, so that you can have a really
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:21.520]   elevated experience. What has happened in our modern world, as we are all awash with cash,
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:28.960]   is we've lost the skill of spending our cash on things that are actually interesting,
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:36.640]   things that are actually memorable. So we spend it really foolishly. And I was listening this week to
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.440]   one of the online currents of things going around, and there was this lady who was talking about the
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:48.160]   fact that she and her husband have $3,000 a month of car payments. And evidently, she drives
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.200]   something like a Tahoe, a new Tahoe, and he drives something like a pickup truck.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.600]   And they've got $150,000 of car debt, and she's got a $1,400 a month payment,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:03.360]   and he's got a $1,600 a month payment on his truck. And I was laughing at them, because
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:10.240]   the woman is just describing a stupid expenditure of money. They drive mediocre vehicles that don't
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.680]   give any actual different experience, because they're unskilled with spending money. Swap out
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:21.920]   one of those vehicles for something that does... Drive something that does something really well.
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:26.720]   Instead of just driving a random $80,000 pickup truck, why don't you drive something that's
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.720]   actually cool? And you define cool. Drive something that's really fast, or really big,
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.440]   or really good, or really small. Instead of driving just another random SUV,
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.440]   go get a Porsche SUV. Go get something that's interesting. And this is what oftentimes,
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.240]   I think, is reflective of our culture. People spend huge amounts of money on boring,
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.320]   mundane stuff that's just the same as everything else. And they do this with their houses,
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.720]   they do this with their cars, they do this with their experiences. They go to the same place,
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.760]   and the same thing, and swipe their credit card and have another mediocre experience that they
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:04.000]   repeat year after year after year. And you ask them to tell you about their vacation, and they
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.320]   say, "Oh, yeah, we went to Myrtle Beach. It was just like it was last year." And hey, listen,
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.720]   you do you. Spend your money however you want. But as far as I'm concerned, I want to actually
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.280]   remember my life, which means that if I've got to drive a car, and I'm not just going to drive
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.480]   an Econobox, then let me drive something that I actually like, that gives me something unique and
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.120]   an experience that I can't get otherwise. If I'm going to go on vacation, why just go down to the
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.320]   same place, have the same experience year after year? I want to remember a vacation. So let's
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.360]   go somewhere really cold, or let's go somewhere really luxurious. Let's go somewhere really basic.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:43.200]   Let's insert variety into life. And then the same thing with dining experiences. Going out to
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:50.160]   Olive Garden, or Fridays, or Morton's Steakhouse, just because that's what we always do,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:56.880]   is super boring. And you can take the same amount of money that you spend and create, custom create,
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.320]   craft an experience that all your guests will remember. So have a dinner party in your home,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:07.760]   and bring in a private chef to cook for you. Or have a, not a potluck, because, well, I guess in
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.800]   my culture we do a lot of potlucks, and potluck is fine, but have an experience where everybody
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:17.920]   brings an ingredient, or everybody brings a dish from your own country. And because you can control
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:24.720]   the environment, you can elevate the entire experience to a much higher level, so that
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:30.720]   coming to your house is actually memorable. And people want to come to your parties because
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:36.160]   they're different, they're memorable. That's what we're all looking for, is memories in our life to
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.000]   some degree. So I think that concludes most of what I have to share with you. The big points
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.720]   that I want to drive home to you are that if you want to avoid the difficulty of, or the weird
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:57.440]   social awkwardness of splitting a check, you avoid that by being assertive. Before you say yes
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:02.480]   to an invitation, just make sure you understand, clarify the details of the bill, clarify whatever
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.160]   you need to clarify. When you're out, recognize that what is socially appropriate is going to
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.600]   change throughout your life. If you're in your teens and early 20s, and you go out with your
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:17.120]   friends, go out with cash in your pocket and just pay for what you ordered. As you move into an
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:23.600]   adult phase of life, then either you pick up the entire check, someone else picks up the entire
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.720]   check, or you just split it straight up the middle. And you don't do this nickel and dime stuff
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:35.040]   anymore. That's excruciatingly annoying. And if you do that, you'll find that your dinner
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:42.880]   invitations will decline significantly. I stepped over that comment, so let me just clarify it
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:50.960]   as I wrap up. The reason you don't want to be the cheap guy who goes out and says, "Well,
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.680]   I just ordered a water and a $12 appetizer, so here's my $14 and y'all can figure it out,"
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:04.880]   is simply you are not respecting the social lubricant, the social dynamics of the group.
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:12.400]   And in a group, it is expected that the group does group things. So when you go out to dinner
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   with five of your friends, and you're the guy who says, "Well, my entree was $12, so here's $14,"
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:24.640]   you're violating the expectation of camaraderie. You're violating the expectation of being in the
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:30.480]   group. That can happen for a little while, but very quickly, that kind of violation of social
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:37.280]   norms creates a significant level of discomfort for other people in the group. And this is not
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:44.320]   always a bad thing. It can be a positive thing. For example, let's say that you go out with
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:51.920]   your pothead drunkard friends, and all five of them are drunkards, and they order mountains of
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:58.960]   alcohol, and you abstain. Well, certainly, you don't have an obligation to split the bill
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.600]   with them. But what's going to happen is pretty quickly, you're not going to be getting the
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:08.560]   invitations because you cause them to be uncomfortable. Is that a bad thing? No. If
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.920]   they're a bunch of drunkards and you're not, then you're better off not hanging out with drunkards.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.640]   Just go and find a group that reflects you. But when you find a group that reflects you,
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:24.160]   maybe you go and join the athletes, and the athletes all go for a 40-mile mountain bike
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.640]   ride after dinner, excuse me, on Friday evening or Saturday morning. You all go for a big, long
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:36.560]   bike ride together, and then you meet up at the local cafe. And none of them drink alcohol because
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.280]   they know it's bad for their performance. Well, now you found your group. So now split with your
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:48.560]   group. But if you are always the... And similarly, if you find... Let's say you care a lot about
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:53.040]   frugality. Well, you'll find your frugal group. And if in your frugal group, everyone goes out
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:58.400]   to dinner and they order the $12 entree and they pay a $2 tip and everyone's done, then you'll do
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:05.360]   what's expected. But when you get into a different group, then that kind of isolationist behavior
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:12.480]   breaks the concept of camaraderie. So that's why it's important that, especially as you pass forward
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.280]   to adulthood, why is it only appropriate either one person pays the check or everybody splits
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   evenly? Because it's a minor, small expression of group camaraderie in the group. That you had a
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.920]   glass of wine, they had three. But just because they had three doesn't mean you're the guy who's
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:36.240]   not gonna pay for more than your share. We're all giving creatures. And that concept of giving to
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.000]   others, even if you're the least consumer, is something that builds social cohesion in the
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.760]   group. So as you get to an adult level, either participate, and when you participate, participate
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:53.360]   in the way that I've described, or don't participate. And then finally, if the money
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:55:00.480]   is uncomfortable to you, don't walk away and isolate yourself because you don't have the money.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:07.200]   Rather, look for creative ways to connect with other people in a way that solves those
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   desires, solves those needs and those desires that we have for connection. So if you can't afford to
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:22.080]   go out to dinner, then don't go out to dinner. But be diligent about inviting people into your
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:26.400]   home or meeting up with people at the local park and arranging a picnic in the local park.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:32.240]   Be diligent about these things so that you can still build those relationships.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:40.480]   A couple of final stories, just to indicate to you what I'm talking about. Because on the whole,
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:48.080]   I really want to encourage you to be more social. All of the psychological data that we have
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.080]   collected across most of our societies indicates that loneliness is at an all-time high.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:02.400]   Many, many people are experiencing lots more loneliness. And this is one of those problems
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:09.840]   that is very solvable. And we can do it. And I think we should solve the problems that we can
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:16.800]   take, and loneliness is one of them. There are many reasons for loneliness. The fracturing of
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:24.240]   family relationships, splintering of societies, changes of lifestyle, social isolation due to
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.960]   fake connectedness. "Hey, I saw your Instagram photos. That's all the same as seeing you in
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.480]   person." But we can fix loneliness with a little bit of effort. And so that's what I want to inspire
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:38.880]   you to do. And I don't want money to stand in your way. So I just want to close with a couple of
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:51.680]   stories that come from my experience. First of all, just a brief story to people. In 2018, my
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.960]   family and I – to Christian people especially – in 2018, my family and I went RVing across
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:07.920]   the United States. And we – on that trip, we were visiting with some friends in some places,
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:14.720]   but much more the trip, we were just by ourselves. And I got very lonely in that experience just
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:19.600]   because I'm used and accustomed to more social interaction. And so one of the things that we
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:26.480]   would do while we travel is we would go each Sunday to a different church meeting. And I resolved not
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:36.000]   to follow my personal biases on doctrinal or distinctives or anything like that. What I did
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.200]   is I pulled out my phone, popped open a Maps app, and I just typed "church" and whatever was the
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.560]   closest church, we went there. And I didn't filter it based upon my own personal convictions and
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:53.680]   beliefs. And so we went to a different church meeting every week. And on that – in that
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:03.920]   experience, what I discovered was that most U.S. American Christians are socially incompetent
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:12.160]   for the actual needs and desires that people have. We would – not all. There were some places where
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.480]   we were extremely warmly received. But what would happen is we were a fairly obvious family. We'd
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.960]   walk in on a Sunday morning, and always there was a wonderful team of people to say, "Hi, welcome."
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.120]   And we would – "What are you doing?" And I would tell them our story, and I would make it clear
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.040]   that we're traveling, we've been on the road for a long time, we're at this campground just down the
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:35.120]   road, and here we are. And what I found is that so many people welcomed us to a church meeting,
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:43.520]   but nothing happened beyond that. And I discovered that I didn't really care about the church
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.240]   meeting, because it was all the same, but what I really wanted was somebody to talk to. I really
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.520]   wanted someone to spend time with. And you go to a church meeting, and great, we can sing some songs,
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.240]   and some preacher will preach a sermon, and hey, it's wonderful, it's fine, no problem.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.760]   But then at the end of it, everyone waved to each other and walk out, and nobody would engage with
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.360]   us. And I understand. Nobody would invite us to lunch, nobody would do anything. And I understand
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:14.480]   why that's the case. After all, our houses are a mess, we don't have any food in the refrigerator,
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:20.080]   it's uncomfortable to have hosts, to have people over, we don't want to show where we live,
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:27.360]   and all this stuff. But friend, this has to end. And so after months of this, I was desperate for
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.680]   fellowship, just desperate for relationship. And it was the first time in my life where I
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:36.720]   had ever experienced that loneliness, because I grew up in a strong community of people with strong
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.960]   family and social bonds. I was in the town where I lived. I never wanted for people to hang out
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:47.040]   with. And yet so many people live their lives in an experience like I lived on that trip that it
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:54.240]   really opened my eyes to what it was like to be lonely. And what's crazy is that I was never
[00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:02.160]   looking or expecting any kind of anything. I'm not expecting to be served steak and lobster,
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:08.000]   I just wanted to hang out. And so if anybody had said, "Hey, you know what? Our house is a mess,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.040]   and we have no food. But you guys are in town, you got three children, and tell you what,
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.200]   there's a park down the road. Why don't you guys go to the park, let the children get some wiggles
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.800]   out. We'll run down to the grocery store, grab a loaf of bread and a bottle of peanut butter and
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:28.160]   jelly, and we'll meet you there at the park in 20 minutes." I would have said, "Absolutely,
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:33.680]   let's do it. This is fantastic." And it would have been amazing to connect with people. But
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:40.320]   in the U.S. American context, that only happened in a few places. And so I want to describe to you
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.880]   that the reason I want us to be more conscious of these social graces is not only to save money,
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.520]   but we need to master these things and make it comfortable for people to spend time with us
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.320]   because people are lonely and we need to do that. So for any, you know, Christians in the audience,
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.680]   I beg you, it's much more important what you do after church than what you do in the church
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:08.960]   meeting itself. And we have to change this culture of weirdness around money and isolation in order
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.800]   to engage with people. And so I made a vow that I will never see a stranger in a church meeting
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:19.440]   again and not invite them to lunch just because of how meaningful it was to me. And for the most
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.000]   part, as far as I know, I have kept that vow. Now, there's been one or two times where I had
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.960]   to get the family home and I consciously didn't notice the stranger that I saw in the peripheral
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:33.680]   vision. It's not a perfect, I haven't done it perfectly, but it's something that we really
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:39.120]   need to do. We really need to engage with people and inviting people out is a really important
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.320]   thing that we can do. And it really engages with people. The second aspect of loneliness,
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.800]   and to be clear, I'm telling these stories because I can and I've experienced them. I'm not asking
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.320]   for pity in any way, shape, or form. I'm trying to explain just some stories that I've experienced
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.600]   in a way that will help you. The second thing that has happened is that when you have children,
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:07.360]   and especially when you have more than about two children, you wind up being extremely socially
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:15.680]   isolated as a family because most people don't know how to deal with children. And this has not
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:23.360]   always been that way, but it is something that now exists. And we need to work on it as a culture
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.440]   if we're going to properly replace ourselves, naive, and possibly expand our civilization,
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.840]   which is one thing that's really important. I never realized this when I was growing up. I was
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:41.360]   the youngest of seven children, and I never realized when I was growing up how few invitations
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:47.600]   we received. Today, I look at it and it's blindingly obvious that our home was open every
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.240]   single week. My parents would have an open night at least every week, and there was usually another,
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:58.320]   somebody else at our home for dinner every week. And that was because we had a lot of children,
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:05.600]   and so we could host. And we really very rarely got invitations to other people's houses.
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.920]   What's been interesting is that my own family has grown, the same thing has happened. And I
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   understand it. If you have one child, you don't even have enough chairs in your home for us.
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.000]   And I get it. And nobody is, I don't judge anybody, no one is being critical. But one of the
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.400]   things that we can do is we can work on solving some of this social isolation that we experience
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:35.360]   by implementing some of these techniques that I have described. And it makes a big difference.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.760]   That's why we don't always just have to go to a restaurant and pay money at the restaurant.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.920]   There are other ways, and we need to embrace those things. Today, I only have five children.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.000]   And while my children are young, they're fairly well-mannered. I work really hard on teaching
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.080]   them to sit at a table. We try not to destroy stuff, and there's exceptions, but we work really
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:01.760]   hard on that stuff. But the social isolation that happens is pretty intense. The first change that
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.600]   happens is once you, so when you're single, you go out with all your single friends, and that's
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.880]   totally normal. Once you're married, you go out with your single, and you're married, and you're
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.960]   coupled friends, and that's okay. Once you have children, however, then the schedule changes.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.040]   And so just simply because you can't go out to dinner at eight o'clock on Friday night,
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.400]   your invitations start to decrease. And so you start hanging out with other families with
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.840]   children. But that's really hard. It's hard, I'm sure, for single people who wish to still have
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:37.520]   their friends that are now on children's schedules, but it's also hard on married people's
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.040]   social lives. And right now, all across the United States, virtually all of my friends who have
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:53.280]   children, they find it very challenging to engage in social relationships because of the way that
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:00.320]   children are excluded from our society. And most of the things that we do are pretty uncomfortable
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.560]   for children. They're not really welcomed. They're, I'm not complaining, it sounds too
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.720]   complainy pants. That's not my goal. My point is to say that most people are pretty socially
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:18.400]   isolated. And it's very challenging for parents with two or three children to call a babysitter
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.160]   and go out to dinner with you. It's challenging. Not impossible, but it's challenging. And then
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:30.480]   because they're in an intense phase financially with lots of bills, and braces, and speech therapy,
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.840]   and private education, all the other things, that their budgets get squeezed. And so going out to
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.960]   dinner is challenging. So what can you do? Well, if you want to support people to have children,
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:48.880]   and you have money, then use your money to facilitate it. So first of all, you could be
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:56.320]   one who invites other people out and makes it clear and recognize that if this dad and mom over
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:03.440]   here have three children, that anytime they are going to go out to eat, they're going to go out
[01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:10.800]   to eat and they have to pay for five meals. For you, however, who is, say, a middle-aged or older
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   couple of two, you can easily pick up those five meals, but for them it's hard. So if necessary,
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.160]   just downgrade the class of restaurant you go to. Go to Olive Garden or wherever you think is kind
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:28.400]   of a low-class place and downgrade it. Or just throw them a, find out what would be really fun
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:35.600]   for them. And so you be the one to cater the picnic in the park and recognize that it may be totally
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:40.880]   normal for you to get together with your friends, but your friends that are parents, it's not normal
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:47.680]   for them. And as they have more children, they become more and more socially isolated.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:55.040]   I'm not intending to, yeah, I don't think any, this is not, in the last couple of years,
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:03.200]   I can count on a couple of fingers the number of dinner invitations that my family gets.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.920]   I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm not complaining. I understand it. It's totally understandable. And
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:12.160]   I make up for it. I invite people over to my house and that just, that's how I handle it.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:18.640]   But just recognize that your friends with children, they don't get invited over. And so if you do,
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.960]   it will make an enormous difference for them and they will love it because even though they have
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:28.320]   children, they're starving for adult conversations and you can facilitate that. That's something that
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:34.480]   you can do. And if we want to grow our society, we need to encourage and help parents. Parenting
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.840]   is something that takes a village in a very real sense. And you and I can be part of that village.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:47.120]   We can help others in a very real and practical way. When we do this, we don't have to give
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:54.240]   anything up. Just by way of example, recently this summer, or I guess it was last sometime,
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.560]   a few months ago, my wife and I and our children, we were visiting some friends in France and these
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:07.280]   particular friends have, I think, seven children. And so it's, what's totally normal is we have
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.560]   five, they have seven. It's totally normal and understandable where that we're not going to go
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:18.160]   to a expensive restaurant and try to sit everyone down and line them all up and order an entree for
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:25.040]   each one of us. So what's neat about it though is you can take a fifth of the money and provide a
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:30.640]   five times greater experience for everyone by planning a really great picnic. And so that's
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.280]   what we did is we went out for a really great picnic on the mountainside and we had all kinds
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.120]   of charcuterie, all kinds of cheeses, all kinds of fancy breads, wine, all the stuff. And we had a
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:50.320]   much more memorable experience. And the pictures that, my wife makes basically yearbooks for our
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:56.000]   children, and the pictures that are in the yearbooks for the children from that experience
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.280]   of the picnic out on the mountainside, those are the ones that are vivid. Those are the ones that
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:06.720]   are real, not just the ones in, "Hey, it's another restaurant with a tablecloth," because of the full
[01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:11.520]   orbed experience. And this is something that we can do so many times when we apply it,
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:18.400]   is we can get better experiences that are more memorable in our minds and include a good
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.800]   expenditure of money on relationships and on experiences. And the closing charge I want to make
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:32.000]   is, to repeat, one of the best things you can do is spend your money on buying friendships.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.960]   There's this very strange parable in the New Testament that Jesus relates. It's very strange
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:47.440]   because the application is very hard to understand. But paraphrasing it loosely,
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.080]   there's a steward that is taking care of the king, and the steward is an unfaithful steward;
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.280]   he's not doing his job properly for the king. And so, he realizes, "You know what? My stewardship,"
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.200]   meaning my job, my position, "is pretty quickly going to end. This king is going to punish me
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.760]   because I'm not doing a great job." So, he calls in all of the people that owe the king money,
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.120]   and he says, "Quick, listen, mark down your debts. You owe the king 10 units of money. Well,
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.000]   let's mark that down to two." And he starts canceling all these debts. So, the king finds
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.440]   out about it, and he says, "Well, you may not be a great steward, but you're very shrewd,
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.080]   and I respect that. After all," you know, what does the verse say? Something like,
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:36.080]   "If you use your unrighteous mammon," meaning money, "to buy friends for yourself on earth."
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:44.960]   And to me, that, while again, I can't elucidate all of the meanings of the parables, I just think
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.840]   that's one of the best mindsets to have around money. Use your unrighteous mammon, use the money
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.520]   that you have, and use it to buy friends for yourself on earth. And he is no fool who spends
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:11:01.440]   his money and is surrounded by friends in an appropriate way. That's a good use of money.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.240]   So, if you can be one, like my friend and mentor was for me for so many years, who is taking a
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:14.560]   young high school student and a young college student on experiences that I never would have
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.760]   been able to afford, those experiences are so valuable for me today. They were different from
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:24.160]   the experiences I could have in other parts of my life, and this is something that we need to
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:31.280]   encourage for young people. It's a diversity of experience. Be that guy, be that gal who
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:37.920]   takes your nieces and your nephews and your friends and acquaintances on different experiences.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.560]   Help their parents in that way by showing them the world or showing them a side of things that
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.000]   they wouldn't otherwise experience. Be that person who takes your money and invites the family out
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.600]   to dinner. And yes, you may have to save for a couple months to be able to feed all their children
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.240]   at the fancy restaurant, but they're going to be very grateful, and they're going to really
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:04.160]   appreciate that, and that's a really good use of money. Be that person who opens your home up to
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:11.360]   other people so that you can consistently entertain others and consistently help to facilitate human
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:18.720]   relationships. At its core, this is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and we have to
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.200]   work on it. We have to do better, and we can use our money to solve a significant amount of the
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.480]   social isolation. What's amazing is once you spend a little bit of money, spend a little bit of time
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:33.360]   with people, that's when the real problems come out, and that's when the real relationship starts.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.600]   That's when you can really get at the heart of the matter and really understand what's going on in
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:47.360]   someone's life, and quite literally, you can save a life. Somebody in your network right now is
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   thinking about committing suicide right now, and he's sitting there asking himself, "Does anybody
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:01.200]   even care?" and you can be the one who does it. I haven't touched on – just a quick brief
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.880]   suggestion in passing – I haven't touched on cocktail parties, things like that. There's a
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:13.120]   really great book that an acquaintance of mine named Nick Gray wrote recently that I have read,
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.240]   and I really like it. It's called The Two-Hour Cocktail Party, How to Build Big Relationships
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.480]   with Small Gatherings. This is on my required reading list for my children because while we
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.920]   certainly host a lot, and I think that my children will absorb that, I think that one of the best
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:36.480]   things that you can do when you are young, single, or just in that scenario is learn how to throw a
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.800]   great cocktail party. This is something that was very common in many cultures in the United States
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:48.960]   in times past, is still common to some degree today, but is not nearly as common as it once was.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.640]   And so this book by Nick Gray, again, is called The Two-Hour Cocktail Party, How to Build Big
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.200]   Relationships with Small Gatherings. If you will take half of your dining out budget that you spend
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:08.800]   on restaurants and invest it instead into hosting regular cocktail parties in your home, I think you
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.360]   will get a 10x return on the money spent. It's a really, really great way for you to connect with
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:21.840]   people. And so I recommend that book to you. It's wonderful. I've learned a lot about building
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:28.000]   relationships, making friends, using money and social occasions to do that, even in moving to
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.120]   a new city. But if I move to a new city, then today, the first thing I'm going to do is start
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:41.920]   hosting a regular cocktail party, probably monthly, but even if it's more occasional than that,
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.640]   it's a phenomenal way for you to build relationships and a really good use of money.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:51.840]   No matter where you are, people are doing it. And I want to reaffirm, this is so important,
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:58.320]   which is why I'm emphasizing it three times over. Nobody cares how fancy your house is.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:05.920]   Nobody cares how expensive your rent is. What people care about is relationship. So if you're
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:15.440]   someone who, like me, suffers from some kind of inferiority complex that you don't have a $10,000
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:24.320]   couch, get rid of that idea and start having people over with your side of the road couch,
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.320]   because all your friends are desperate for somebody to start creating opportunities for
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.600]   them. And so having a cocktail party is a really, really great way to approach it.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:41.520]   There are other books that I have appreciated in terms of how to host a great party. I think that
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:47.440]   as you host cocktail parties using the framework that Nick Gray teaches in his book,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.160]   I think you can move on to dinner parties in a really beautiful way. And I think that
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:58.880]   having dinner parties is a phenomenal way to spend your money. As I described, even if you need to
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:03.600]   bring in caterers or outside chefs, it's so easy in the United States with all the to-go food and
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.160]   all the catering food that we have. You don't even need a private chef. But go ahead and use your
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:13.120]   home regularly for those kinds of events. People really appreciate it. And learn how to have a
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:21.360]   multi-phased dinner party, because this mixing and mingling of people is a really phenomenal way to
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:26.320]   improve your events. You should have pre-dinner cocktails, and you'll have some guests that come
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.920]   for pre-dinner cocktails and then leave. Then you'll have your dinner party, and then you'll
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:34.560]   have your after-dinner drinks, your after-dinner cigars, whatever it is, however you like to fit
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.800]   that into your evening's events. And have people come in and out, and your friends will love you
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.440]   for it. And if you want to build a wide network of relationships, then develop the skills of
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:50.000]   becoming a super connector, and your friends will really value you. I'm getting beyond my script
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.760]   here, as is probably obvious, but becoming a super connector and a facilitator of relationships is
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:03.840]   really important. It's a really important component of your own life on many levels. You want to be
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.920]   the guy that if you need a job, you pick up the phone, you make three phone calls,
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.600]   and you've got a job. That should be your goal and your ambition. But in order for that to work,
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.600]   as we can take from the great book by Harvey McKay, you need to dig your well before you're
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.560]   thirsty. You always dig your well before you're thirsty. And so you need to invest in relationships
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:30.560]   much long before you ever need them, in order to have a robust set of connections. And so
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   start with the two-hour cocktail party and go from there. For anybody who is touched by what
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.560]   I said about American churches and American Christianity, I would urge you to read a book
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:49.600]   by Alexander Strauch, S-T-R-A-U-C-H, called The Hospitality Commands. This is a very theological...
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.400]   that was the wrong word. This is a very Christian book, and it doesn't give any specifics like how
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:01.040]   to host a cocktail party, but it is a very excellent book, and it shows why Christians
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.640]   should be the most hospitable people out there. And it brings me great shame to know that this
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.800]   is not the case right now, but we can change it. It just begins with us. So check out the book by
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:18.960]   Alexander Strauch called The Hospitality Commands, and I promise you that that's what we need more of.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.920]   We need much more of that in our culture. And the final comment I want to make is simply remember
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:31.680]   the podcast episode that I did on why purchasing a second home may be your best investment.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.720]   This week I've been with my family in Florida, and I'm just reminded at the moment my family,
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.720]   my large extended family, we don't have a great party house at the moment. And I don't see an
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.920]   alternative pathway, but I recognize the need for it. What I mean is that I don't think that
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.320]   my parents should have the party house right now, but I'm reminded that it would be really great if
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:01.040]   they did. So if you are wealthier, then do as I strongly encouraged both in this episode and
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:07.280]   also in that previous episode where I talked about it. Spend your money to buy a really great house.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.160]   And what you're looking for is you're looking for a house that is conducive to interaction and is
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:18.080]   conducive to activities. What you'll find is that, of course, if you are an adult, then you're
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.720]   perfectly happy to sit down and spend all your time just sitting and talking around a table.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:28.160]   Our children look at us and they're mystified by the way that we live our lives. But if you
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:33.520]   have children or teenagers, then choose a house that's going to be conducive to those activities.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.520]   Choose a house that has an appropriate venue for entertaining. Choose a house that has
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:43.120]   appropriate activities. Look for a lake house with a boat and set of skis and wakeboards,
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.160]   a couple of jet skis, some canoes, whatever it is. Look for a house that has a big field for
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:52.960]   sports activities and a volleyball game and physical things. Look for a beach house where
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.200]   you've got various beach activities and you can get out the surfboards or the kite boards or
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.760]   whatever is appropriate for where you are. Look for a house with a great game room or build a
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.480]   house with a great game room and lots of activities. Spend the money on this stuff and then fill your
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:12.000]   house up with love. Fill your house up with people. And this is a really good use of your money.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.800]   If you don't have the house, then just develop the equipment for it. And you can learn how to
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:24.720]   cook in the local park. You can host, be a great host, even if you don't have the infrastructure
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:30.480]   for this. I've proven it. Years ago, my wife and I sold our house, moved into a small apartment.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:35.280]   I realized we're going to have a harder time entertaining. And so I went and I bought one of
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:40.160]   the Camp Chef three-burner stoves, got a nice carrying bag for it. I bought a Camp Chef griddle,
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:45.040]   36-inch griddle that goes in that, super portable, but great griddle. I invested in just kind of a
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.840]   simple cooking infrastructure, a couple of totes with cooking stuff. And I hosted parties at the
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.040]   local park where I fed 50 to 100 people without too much difficulty. And that really works as
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.000]   well. There is something that you can do. There is some way that you can spend money to buy friends
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   for yourself here on earth. And as your official financial advisor, I hereby endorse that practice
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:12.160]   very highly. Anything you can do to spend money on people is going to be a great use of your money.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:14.240]   Thank you for listening. I'll be back with you very soon.
