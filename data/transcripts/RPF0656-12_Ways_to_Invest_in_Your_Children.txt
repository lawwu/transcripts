And I think that if you have a limited number of dollars to invest, that there are some other investments that could be far more productive than setting aside money in a college fund.

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:31.180]   Your, your, your child's education is that your child will know how to learn.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.320]   The basic life skill is knowing how to learn.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.560]   I don't think that's necessarily the most important thing you could do for your child.

[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.460]   would be to make sure that your child is a stable normal person who it doesn't experience the fears and the phobias and kind of the psychological unrest that many people experience. I think you can provide that through things like a stable home environment through a well-crafted world view by protecting them from outside risk and danger and the environment.

[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:09.540]   They've written down the mistakes and they've described why they were a mistake so that we can understand the

[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   But yet the man who knows how to read and does not read is as poor as the one who cannot read but you get the idea the knowledge can be there and yet it doesn't matter if it's sitting there if you haven't gone and looked for it the vast majority of libraries that I visit are largely
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:31:09.580]   empty.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:09.580]   Many of the bookstores that I visit don't have that many people in there and yet I can't think of a more productive use of money than the purchase and acquisition of books. Now back to knowing how to read. One of the skills that I've developed over the years and developing a love of reading in our children one of the skills that I've developed over the years is the ability to read quickly and broadly and this is where people who don't have a basic skill of reading that has been honed over the years

[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   really really suffer a good friend of mine very smart modestly successful a normal person and he possesses the basic skills of reading he can sit down with a paragraph of written English text and he can read it with decent proficiency he'll pronounce the words correctly he's not a stupid person he has a bachelor's degree but it's painful for him to pick up a book and do a survey of the book
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   and he can read it with decent proficiency he'll pronounce the words correctly he's not a stupid person he has a bachelor's degree but it's painful for him to pick up a book and do a survey of the book and do a survey of the book

[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:09.620]   and he can't read quickly he's never kind of crossed over from that basic I don't know all the words in the reading the proper lingo to use but he's never crossed over from the basic decoding of words and develop the ability to grasp paragraphs pages and chapters with minimal involvement and that's the skills that I think can be developed but it can only be developed if you help your child to cross over from knowing how to read
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:09.620]   and he can't read quickly he's never crossed over from the basic decoding of words and develop the ability to grasp paragraphs pages and chapters with minimal involvement and that's the skills that I think can be developed but it can only be developed if you help your child to cross over from knowing how to read
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   to loving to read for me it was simply because I crossed over from knowing how to read a love to read by reading a lot of fluffy things that I enjoyed lots of novels lots of stories lots of engaging things and so then the actual mechanics of reading became completely second nature it's just I don't even think about the mechanics of reading at least in English then once you have that you can then bring that skill to areas that actually make a difference in your life

Beyond that, you can decide and consider how to invest in reading and maybe tutoring for your children, maybe surrounding them with good books, maybe modeling reading yourself. At the end of the day, reading doesn't cost all that much, but purchasing books and having room to house books is, in my opinion, very important. I appreciate many things that Ms. Marie Kondo might say, but I don't appreciate what she has to say about books. You judge for yourself.

[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:14.380]   They need to have good academics. They need to have some some interests that are outside of academics, but there's a whole long amount of time that's available for learning skills and supervising skills and as long as I'm in a work situation where I can have the flexibility then one of the things I hope to be able to do when I'm at that stage is to help my child by the first rental house and make that the teenage project.
