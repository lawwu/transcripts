[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   The following is a conversation with Matt Walker,
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.840]   sleep scientist, professor of neuroscience
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.700]   and psychology at Berkeley, author of "Why We Sleep"
[00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.540]   and the host of a new podcast
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.240]   called the Matt Walker Podcast.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.140]   It's 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month,
[00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.760]   covering sleep and other health and science topics.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.560]   I love it and recommend it highly.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.420]   It's up there with the greats
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080]   like the Huberman Lab Podcast with Andrew Huberman
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.620]   and I think David Sinclair is putting out
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.340]   an audio series soon too.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.780]   I can't wait to listen to it.
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.820]   I'm really excited by the future of science
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.680]   in the podcasting world.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.660]   To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors,
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.300]   Stamps.com, Squarespace, Athletic Greens,

[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.840]   Their links are in the description.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.240]   As a side note, let me say that to me,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.120]   a healthy life is one in which you fall in love
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.640]   with the world around you, with ideas, with people,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.060]   with small goals and big goals, no matter how difficult,
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.840]   with dreams you hold onto and chase for years.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.920]   Life should be lived fully.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.980]   That to me is the priority.
[00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.060]   That to me is a healthy life.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.180]   Second to that is the understanding
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.900]   and the utilization of the best available science
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.540]   on diet, exercise, supplements, sleep
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.740]   and other lifestyle choices.
[00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.520]   To me, science in the realm of health is a guide
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.960]   for we should try, not the absolute truth
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.980]   of how to live life.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.040]   The goal is to learn to listen to your body
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.800]   and figure out what works best for you.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.480]   All that said, a good night's sleep can be a great tool
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.720]   in making life awesome and productive.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   And Matt is a great advocate of the how and the why of sleep.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.760]   We agree on some things and disagree on others,
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   but he's a great human being, a great scientist
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.500]   and as of recently, a friend with whom I enjoy
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.700]   having these wide ranging conversations.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.860]   This is the Lex Friedman podcast
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.200]   and here is my conversation with Matt Walker.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.020]   You should try these shades on and see what you look like.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.720]   - So they are now your shades.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.560]   And that's not a question.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.700]   - It's the same thing as Putin took the Superbowl ring
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.900]   and it's now his ring.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960]   (both laughing)
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.700]   - Yeah, one wonders if he was offered it,
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.280]   but they are yours.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.940]   - When did you first fall in love
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.900]   with the dream of understanding sleep?
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.400]   Like where did the fascination with sleep begin?
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.140]   - So back in the United Kingdom,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.140]   you can sort of start doing medicine at age 18
[00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.100]   and it's a five year program.
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.860]   And I was at the Queen's Medical Center in the UK.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.760]   And I remember just being fascinated
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.220]   by states of consciousness and particularly anesthesia.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.100]   I was thinking, isn't that incredible?
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880]   Within seconds, I can take a perfectly conscious
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.020]   human being and I can remove all existence
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.860]   of the mentality and their awareness within seconds.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.540]   And that stunned me.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.540]   So I started to get really interested in conscious states.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.980]   I even started to read a lot about hypnosis
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.340]   and all of these things, hypnosis,
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.380]   even sleep and dreams at the time,
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.980]   they were very esoteric.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.780]   It was sort of charlatan science at that stage.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.260]   And I think almost all of my colleagues
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.700]   and I are accidental sleep researchers.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.020]   No one, as I recall in the classroom
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.380]   when you're sort of five years old
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.380]   and the teacher says,
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.040]   "What would you like to be when you grow up?"
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.300]   No one's putting their hand up and saying,
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.540]   "I would love to be a sleep researcher."
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.500]   And so when I was doing my PhD,
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.060]   I was trying to identify different forms of dementia
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.500]   very early on in the course.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.660]   And I was using electrical brainwave recordings to do that.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.620]   And I was failing miserably.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.260]   It was a disaster, just no result after no result.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.220]   And I used to go home to the doctor's residence
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.260]   with this sort of a little igloo of journals
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.060]   that at the weekend I would sort of sit in and read.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.980]   And which I'm now thinking,
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.180]   do I really want to admit this?
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.800]   'Cause it sounds like I had no social life,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.900]   which I didn't, I was social leper.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.260]   But, and I started to realize that some parts of the brain
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.020]   were sleep related areas.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.540]   And some dementias were eating away
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.660]   those sleep related areas.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.780]   Other dementias would leave them untouched.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.060]   And I thought, well, I'm doing this all wrong.
[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.260]   I'm measuring my patients while they're awake.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.980]   Instead I should be measuring them while they're asleep.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.520]   Started doing that, got some amazing results.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.700]   And then I wanted to ask the question,
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.100]   is that sleep disruption that my patients are experiencing
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.680]   as they go into dementia,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.900]   maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.940]   I wonder if it's a cause of the dementia.
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.060]   And at that point, which was, cough, cough, 20 years ago,
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.060]   no one could answer a very simple fundamental question.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.020]   Why do we sleep?
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.020]   And I at the time didn't realize
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.700]   that some of the most brilliant minds
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.340]   in scientific history had tried to answer that question
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.580]   and failed.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.540]   And at that point, I just thought, well,
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.660]   I'm going to go and do a couple of years of sleep research
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.220]   and I'll figure out why we sleep.
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.700]   And then I'll come back to my patients
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.720]   in this question of dementia.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.420]   And as I said, that was 20 years ago.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.620]   And what I realized is that hard questions
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.460]   care very little about who asks them.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.040]   They will meter out their lessons of difficulty
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.200]   all the same.
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.880]   And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.540]   why do we sleep?
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.040]   But in truth, 20 years later,
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.320]   we've had to upend the question
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.260]   rather than saying, why do we sleep?
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.980]   And by the way, the answer then was
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.160]   that we sleep to cure sleepiness,
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.080]   which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.360]   That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.600]   of food, same with sleep.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.320]   Now we've actually have to ask the question,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.100]   is there any physiological system in the body
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.360]   or any major operation of the mind
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.400]   that isn't wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.560]   or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough?
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.880]   And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   - So far, the answer seems to be no.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   So why does the body and the mind crave sleep then?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.200]   Why do we sleep?
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.800]   How can we begin to answer that question then?
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   - So I think one of the ways that I think about this
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.080]   or one of the answers that came to me is the following.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.480]   The reason that we implode so quickly
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.680]   and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.840]   is because human beings seem to be one of the few species
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.060]   that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.740]   for no apparent good reason, biological.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   And what that led me then to was the following.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.280]   Mother nature as a consequence,
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.480]   so no other species does what we do in that context.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.600]   There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.120]   but for very obvious, clear biological reasons.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.240]   One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.520]   The second is when they're caring for their newborn.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.800]   So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.560]   The female will go away from the pod,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.400]   give birth and then bring the calf back.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.820]   And during that time,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.520]   the mother will undergo sleep deprivation.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.160]   And then the third one is during migration
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   when birds are flying trans oceanographic to 3000 miles.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.480]   But for the most part, it's never seen in the animal kingdom
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.680]   which brings me back to the point.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   Therefore, mother nature in the course of evolution
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.460]   has never had to face the challenge
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.580]   of this thing called sleep deprivation.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.000]   And therefore she has never created a safety net in place
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.880]   to circumnavigate this common influence.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.980]   And there is a good example where we have,
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.840]   which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.000]   Because during our evolutionary past,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.440]   we had famine and we had feast.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.680]   And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.480]   which is how can I store caloric credit
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   so that I can spend it when I go into debt?
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.620]   And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.040]   Where is the fat cell for sleep?
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.400]   Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.560]   And unfortunately we don't seem to have one
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.400]   because she's never had to face that challenge.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.680]   - So even if there's not some kind of physics
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.300]   fundamental need for sleep,
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.120]   that physiologically or psychologically,
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.640]   the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.040]   And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.560]   for sleep deprivation.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.160]   So it's interesting that why we sleep
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.620]   might not have a good answer,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.440]   but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.700]   - Yeah, and we have many answers right now.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.940]   In some ways, the question of why we sleep
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.960]   was the wrong question too.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.240]   It's what are the pluripotent many reasons we sleep?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.520]   We don't just sleep for one reason.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.800]   Because from an evolutionary perspective,
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.000]   it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   When you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.520]   you're not reproducing, you're not caring for your young,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.460]   you're not foraging for food,
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.640]   and worse still, you're vulnerable to predation.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.720]   So on any one of those grounds,
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.680]   especially as a collective,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.560]   sleep should have been strongly selected
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.800]   against in the course of evolution.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.920]   But in every species that we've studied carefully to date,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   sleep is present.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.040]   - So it is important.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.000]   So you're right.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.380]   I think I've heard arguments
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.240]   from an evolutionary biology perspective
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.780]   that sleep is actually advantageous.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.600]   Maybe like some kind of predator-prey relationships.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.320]   But you're saying, and it actually makes way more sense
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.400]   what you're saying, is it should have been selected against.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.280]   Why close your eyes?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.120]   - Yeah, why?
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.880]   Because, and there was an energy conservation hypothesis
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.000]   for a while, which is that we need to essentially
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200]   go into low battery mode,
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.860]   power down because it's unsustainable.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.880]   But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.660]   because sleep is an incredibly active process.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.900]   In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch,
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.380]   but remaining conscious,
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.040]   versus you lying on the couch and falling asleep,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.600]   it's only a savings of about 140, 150 calories.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.040]   In other words, you just go out and club another baby seal
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.360]   or whatever it was, and you wouldn't worry.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.020]   So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation,
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.760]   much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time,
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.600]   much more to it than simply predator-prey relationships.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.220]   If sleep really did, and looking back,
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.680]   even very old evolutionary organisms like earthworms,
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.120]   millions of years old,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.720]   they have periods where they're active
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.520]   and periods where they're passively asleep.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.720]   It's called lethargics.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.680]   (laughs)
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.200]   And so what that in some ways suggested to me
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.680]   was sleep evolved with life itself on this planet,
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.680]   and then it has fought its way through heroically
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.640]   every step along the evolutionary pathway,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.540]   which then leads to the sort of famous sleep statement
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.860]   from a researcher that if sleep doesn't serve
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.140]   an absolutely vital function or functions,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.160]   then it's the biggest mistake
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.640]   the evolutionary process has ever made.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.240]   And we've now realized mother nature
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.080]   didn't make a spectacular blunder with sleep.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.120]   - You've mentioned the idea of conscious states.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.080]   Do you think of sleep as a fundamentally
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   different conscious state than awake-ness?
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.280]   And how many conscious states are there?
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.640]   So when you're into it,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.320]   you're understanding of what the mind can do.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.480]   Do you think awake state, sleep state,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.680]   or is there some kind of continuum?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   There's a complicated state transition diagram.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.520]   Like how do you think about this whole space?
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.040]   - I think about it as a state-space diagram,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.080]   and I think it's probably more of a continuum
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.660]   than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.400]   So we used to think absent of anesthesia
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.520]   that there were already three main states of consciousness.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.960]   There was being awake,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   being in non-rapid eye movement sleep or non-dream sleep,
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.280]   and then being in rapid eye movement sleep or dream sleep.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.200]   And those were the three states
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.480]   within which your brain could percolate and be conscious.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.080]   Conscious during non-REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say,
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.480]   but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.440]   I don't believe that though anymore.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.020]   And the reason is because we can have daydreams,
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.140]   and we are in a very different wakeful state
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.520]   in those daydreams than we are when we are,
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.160]   as we are now together, present and extraceptively focused
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.920]   rather than intraceptively focused.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.820]   And then we also know that as you are sort of progressing
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.840]   into those different stages of sleep during non-REM sleep,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.320]   you can also still dream.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.360]   Depends on your definition of dreaming,
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.880]   but we seem to have some degree of dreaming
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.560]   in almost all stages of sleep.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.960]   We've also then found that when you are sleep deprived,
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.220]   there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.060]   Despite the animal being, you know,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.420]   behaviorally from best we can tell awake,
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.100]   individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.740]   will go into a sleep-like state.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.460]   And humans do this too.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.940]   When we are sleep deprived,
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.580]   we have what are called micro-sleeps
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.180]   where the eyelid will partially close
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.520]   and the brain essentially falls lapses
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.060]   into a state of sleep,
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.320]   but behaviorally you seem to be awake
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   and the danger here is road traffic accidents.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.180]   So these are the, what we call these sort of micro-sleep
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.780]   events at the wheel.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.080]   Now, if you're traveling at 65 miles an hour
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.720]   in a two ton vehicle, you know,
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.160]   it takes probably around one second to drift
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.360]   from one lane to the next.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.160]   And it takes two seconds to go completely off the road.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.660]   So if you have one of these micro-sleeps at the wheel,
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.580]   you know, it could be the last micro-sleep
[00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.540]   that you ever have.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.740]   But I don't now see it as a set of, you know,
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.300]   very binary distinct, you know, step function states.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.480]   It's not a one or a zero.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.060]   I see it more of a, as a continuum.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.060]   - Yeah, so I've for five, six years at MIT
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.740]   really focused on this human side of driving question.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   And one of the big concerns is the micro-sleeps,
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.340]   drowsiness, these kinds of ideas.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.060]   And one of the open questions was,
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.920]   is it possible through computer vision to detect,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.300]   or any kind of sensors?
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.860]   The nice thing about computer vision
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.860]   is you don't have to have direct contact to the person.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.700]   Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.100]   Is it possible to detect these kinds of micro-sleeps
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.080]   or actually just sleep in general?
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.220]   Among other things, like distraction.
[00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.020]   These are all words that have so many meanings
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.860]   and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.260]   Just because you're looking at something
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.140]   doesn't mean you're loading in the information.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.220]   Just because you're looking away
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.720]   doesn't mean your peripheral vision
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.740]   can't pick up the important information.
[00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.860]   There's so many complicated vision science things there.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.980]   So I wonder if you could say something to,
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.300]   they say the eyes are the windows to the soul.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   Do you think the eyes can reveal something about sleepiness
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.820]   through computer vision,
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.620]   through just looking at the video of the face?
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.220]   And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.180]   have talked about this.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.660]   I would love to work on this together.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.500]   - You should do.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.680]   - It's a fascinating problem.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.220]   But drowsiness is a tricky one.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.380]   So there's what kind of information?
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.740]   There's blinking and there's eye movement.
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.020]   And those are the ones that can be picked up
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:46.940]   with computer vision.
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.020]   Do you think those are signals that could be used
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.700]   to say something about where we are in this continuum?
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.580]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.620]   And I think there are a number of other features too.
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.500]   I think aperture of eye,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:03.160]   so in other words, partial closures, full closures,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.820]   duration of those closures,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.120]   duration of those partial closures of the eyelid.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.380]   I think there may be some information in the pupil as well,
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.420]   because as we're transitioning between those states,
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.900]   there are changes in what's called
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.300]   the automatic nervous system,
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.780]   or technically it's called the autonomic nervous system,
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.060]   part of which will control your pupillary size.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.820]   So I actually think that there is probably
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.280]   a wealth of information.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.680]   When you combine that probably with aspects
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.940]   of steering angle, steering maneuver,
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.480]   and if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.040]   my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   that creates a phenotype of you are starting to fall asleep.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.860]   And as the autonomous controls develop,
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.480]   it's time for them to kick in.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.800]   - Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.640]   sort of have something, beta version,
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.900]   or maybe an alpha version of this
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.400]   already starting to come online,
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.960]   where they have a little camera in the wheel
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.520]   that I think tries to look at some features.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.720]   - Almost everybody doing this, and it's very alpha.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.200]   So, you know, the thing that you currently have,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.400]   some people have that in their car,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.480]   there's a coffee cup or something that comes up
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.980]   that you might be sleepy.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.580]   The primary signal that they're comfortable using
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.380]   is a steering wheel reversals.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.460]   So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.700]   and how much you're interacting with it
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.900]   as a sign of sleepiness.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.620]   So if you have to constantly correct the car,
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.360]   that's a sign of you starting to drift into micro sleep.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.540]   I think that's a very, very crude signal.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.180]   It's probably a powerful one.
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.740]   There's a whole nother component to this,
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.740]   which is it seems like it's so driver and subject dependent.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.580]   How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:08.200]   seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.820]   where you can't just use one signal.
[00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.140]   It's kind of like what you're saying,
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.580]   there has to be a lot of different signals
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.440]   that you should then be able to combine.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.820]   The hope is there's the searches for like universal signals
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.600]   that are pretty damn good for like 90% of people.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.240]   But I don't think we need to take necessarily
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   quite that approach.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.100]   I think what we could do in some clever fashion
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.520]   is using the individual.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.620]   So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.440]   is that there is an array of features that we know
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.800]   provide information that is sensitive to whether or not
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.580]   you're falling asleep at the wheel.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.940]   Some of those, let's say that there are 10 of them.
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.860]   For me, seven of them are the cardinal features.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.560]   For you, however, six of them,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.060]   and they're not all the same sort of overlapping,
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.940]   are those for you.
[00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.880]   I think what we need is algorithms
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.460]   that can firstly understand when you are well slept.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.940]   So let's say that people have sleep trackers at night
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.260]   and then your car integrates that information.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.100]   - That would be amazing.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.620]   - And it understands when you are well slept.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.660]   And then you've got the data of the individual behavior
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.340]   unique to that individual, snowflake-like,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.900]   when they are well slept.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.520]   This is the signature of well-rested driving.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.220]   Then you can look at deviations from that
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.220]   and pattern match it with the sleep history
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.700]   of that individual.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.460]   And then I don't need to find the sort of, you know,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.060]   the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people.
[00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.380]   I can create a very bespoke, tailor-like set of features,
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.560]   a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.520]   You know, that would be my,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.540]   if you want to ask me about moonshots and crazy ideas,
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.380]   that's where I'd go.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.180]   But to start with, I think your approach is a great one.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.060]   Let's find something that covers 99% of the people.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.700]   Because the worrying thing about microsleeps, of course,
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.420]   unlike, you know, drugs or alcohol,
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.300]   which, you know, certainly is a terrible thing
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.920]   to be behind the wheel,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   with those, often you react too late.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.160]   And that's the reason you get into an accident.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.820]   When you fall asleep behind the wheel,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.240]   you don't react at all.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.220]   You know, at that point,
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.580]   there is a two-ton missile driving down the street
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.920]   and no one's in control.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.380]   That's why those accidents can often be more dangerous.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.320]   - Yeah, and the fascinating thing is,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.380]   in the case of semi-autonomous vehicles,
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.920]   like Tesla Autopilot,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.700]   this is where I've had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk,
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:50.020]   and the human factors community,
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.420]   which is this community that one of the big things
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.780]   they study is human supervision over automation.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.220]   So you have like pilots, you know,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.760]   supervising an airplane that's mostly flying autonomously.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.740]   The question is, when we're actually doing the driving,
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.900]   how do microsleeps or general,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.140]   how does drowsiness progress
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.060]   and how does it affect our driving?
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.500]   That question becomes more fascinating, more complicated,
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.580]   when your task is not driving,
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.680]   but supervising the driving.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.820]   So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong.
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.200]   And that is complicated,
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.300]   but the basic conclusions from many decades
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.340]   is that humans are really crappy at supervising
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.780]   because they get drowsy
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.540]   and lose vigilance much, much faster.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.260]   The really surprising thing with Tesla Autopilot,
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:43.660]   it was surprising to me,
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.060]   surprising to the human factors community,
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.380]   and in fact, they still argue with me about it,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.380]   is it seems that humans in Teslas with Autopilot
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.740]   and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant,
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.580]   at least with the studies we've done.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.300]   So there's something about the urgency of driving.
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.220]   I can't, I'm not sure why,
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.880]   but there's something about the risk,
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.780]   I think the fact that you might die
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.440]   is still keeping people awake.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.500]   The question is, as Tesla Autopilot
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.420]   or similar systems get better and better and better,
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.700]   how does that affect increasing drowsiness?
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.220]   And that's when you need to have,
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.380]   that's where the big disagreement was.
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.340]   You need to have driver sensing,
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.140]   meaning driver facing camera
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.660]   that tracks some kind of information about the face
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.060]   that can tell you drowsiness.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.980]   So you can tell the car if you're drowsy
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.220]   so that the car can be like,
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.900]   you should be probably driving or pull to the side.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.460]   - Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.700]   - Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.660]   of a human and machine.
[00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.820]   But currently it's mostly steering wheel based.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   So this idea that your hands should be on the steering wheel
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.300]   that's a sign that you're paying attention
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.460]   is an outdated and a very crude metric.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.220]   - I agree, yeah.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.340]   I think there are far more sophisticated ways
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.400]   that we can solve that problem if we invest.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.620]   - Can I ask you a big philosophical question
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.980]   before we get into fun details?
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.560]   On the topic of conscious states,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.220]   how fundamental do you think is consciousness
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.340]   to the human mind?
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.420]   I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.060]   So in your study of sleep,
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.100]   do you think the hard question of consciousness,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.380]   that it feels like something to be us,
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:46.860]   is that like a nice little feature,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.220]   like a quirk of our mind,
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.980]   or is it somehow fundamental?
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.820]   Because sleep feels like we take a step out
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.820]   of that consciousness a little bit.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.540]   So from all your study of sleep,
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.300]   do you think consciousness is like deeply part of who we are
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.820]   or is it just a nice trick?
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.620]   - I think it's a deeply embedded feature
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.340]   that I can imagine has a whole panoply
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.100]   of biological benefits.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.700]   But to your point about sleep,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.900]   what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.020]   and we've done some,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.140]   it's very, very rare at all, in fact,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.540]   for you to end up becoming someone other
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:33.420]   than who you are in your dreams.
[00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.940]   Now, you can have third-person perspective dreams
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.760]   where you can see yourself in the dream
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.760]   as if you've risen above your physical being.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.220]   But for the most part,
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.220]   it's very rare that we lose our sense of conscious self.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.700]   And maybe I'm sort of doing a sleight of hand
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.860]   because it's really what I'm saying
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.620]   is it's very rare that we lose our sense
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.700]   of who we are in dreams.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.980]   We never do.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.380]   Now, that's not to suggest that dreams aren't utterly bizarre
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.820]   and I mean, when you slept last night,
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.100]   which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me,
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.740]   but when you went into dreaming,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.180]   you became flagrantly psychotic.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.420]   And there are five essentially good reasons.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.460]   Firstly, you started to see things which were not there,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.180]   so you were hallucinating.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.280]   Second, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true,
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.180]   so you were delusional.
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   Third, you became confused about time and place and person,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.140]   so you're suffering
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.580]   from what we would call disorientation.
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.660]   Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions,
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.660]   something that psychiatrists
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.460]   will call being affectively labile.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.580]   And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.140]   and you forgot most, if not all of that dream experience,
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:52.820]   so you're suffering from amnesia.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.900]   If you had to experience any one of those five things
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.060]   while you're awake,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.840]   you would probably be seeking psychological help.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.940]   So I place that as a backdrop
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.140]   against your astute question,
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.220]   because despite all of that psychosis,
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:16.060]   there is still a present self nested at the heart of it,
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.780]   meaning that I think it's very difficult for us
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.100]   to abandon our conscious sense of self.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.900]   And if it's that hard,
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.260]   the old adage in some ways that you can't outrun your shadow,
[00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.400]   but here it's more of a philosophical question,
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.660]   which is about the conscious mind
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.220]   and what the state of consciousness actually means
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.240]   in a human being.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.700]   So I think that that to me,
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.700]   you become so dislocated
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.860]   from so many other rational ways of waking consciousness,
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.500]   but one thing that won't go away,
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.500]   that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know,
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.180]   manacled is this your sense of conscious self.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.380]   - Yeah, there's a strong sign
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.380]   that consciousness is fundamental to the human mind.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.900]   - Or we're just creatures of habit.
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.860]   We've gotten used to having consciousness.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.060]   Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.960]   or a lot of like mental work to escape that.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.340]   I mean, it's like trying to launch a rocket.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.060]   You know, the energy that has to be put in
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.140]   to create escape velocity from the gravitational pull
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.060]   of this thing called planet earth is immense.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.260]   Well, the same thing is true for us
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.700]   to abandon our sense of conscious self.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.360]   The amount of biological, the amount of substances,
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.020]   the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.420]   to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.380]   What does that tell us about then
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.220]   the fundamental state of our conscious self?
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.540]   - Yeah, it also probably says that it's quite useful
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.700]   to have consciousness for survival
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.420]   and for just operation in this world.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.780]   And perhaps for intelligence.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.020]   I'm one of the, on the AI side,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.020]   people that think that intelligence requires consciousness.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.960]   So like high levels of general intelligence
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.460]   requires consciousness.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.700]   Most people in the AI field think like consciousness
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.580]   and intelligence are fundamentally different.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.100]   You can build a computer that's super intelligent.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.840]   It doesn't have to be conscious.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.660]   I think that if you define super intelligence
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.580]   by being good at chess, yes.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.820]   But if you define super intelligence
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:35.020]   as being able to operate in this living world of humans
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.540]   and be able to perform all kinds of different tasks,
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.020]   consciousness, it seems to be somehow fundamental
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.800]   to richly integrate yourself into the human experience,
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.320]   into society.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.960]   It feels like you have to be a conscious being.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.460]   But then we don't even know what consciousness is
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.640]   and we certainly don't know how to engineer it
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.680]   in our machines.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.120]   - I love the fact that there are still questions
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.260]   that are so embryonic because, you know,
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.640]   I suspect it's the same with you.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:09.820]   Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions.
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.160]   You know, it's questions where, you know,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.040]   questions turn me on, answers less so.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.840]   And I love the fact that we are still embryonic
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.200]   in our sense of arguing about even what the definition
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.800]   of consciousness is.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.360]   But I also find it fascinating,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.540]   I think it's thoroughly delightful to absorb yourself
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.120]   in the thought.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.760]   Think about the brain and we can move back
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.520]   across the complexity of phylogeny from, you know,
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.360]   humans to mammals to sort of birds to reptiles,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.900]   amphibians, fish, and you can, bacteria, whatever you want.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.680]   And you can go through this and say, okay,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.680]   where is the hard line of, you know,
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.240]   what we would define as consciousness?
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.400]   And I'm sure it's got something to do with the complexity
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.600]   of the neural system, of that I'm fairly certain.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.400]   But to me, it's always been fascinating.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.520]   So what is it then?
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.680]   You know, is it that I just keep adding neurons
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.200]   to a Petri dish and I just keep adding them
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   and adding them and adding them.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   At some point when I hit a critical mass
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.240]   of interconnected neurons, that is the mass of the,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.320]   you know, the interconnected human brain, then bingo.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.840]   All of a sudden it kicks into gear
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.360]   and we have consciousness.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.600]   - Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.520]   - Correct, yeah.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.320]   But there is something about the complexity
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.720]   of the nervous system that I think is fundamental
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.560]   to consciousness.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.040]   And the reason I bring that up is because when we're trying
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.280]   to then think about creating it in an artificial way,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.760]   does that inform us as to the complexity
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.340]   that we should be looking at in terms of development?
[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.480]   I also think that it's a missed opportunity
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.020]   in the sort of digital space for us to try
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.400]   to recreate human consciousness.
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.720]   We've already got human consciousness.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.520]   What if we were to think about creating some other form
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.360]   of consciousness?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.560]   Why do we have to think that the ultimate in the creation
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:07.400]   of, you know, an artificial intelligence is the replication,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.920]   you know, of a human state of consciousness?
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.680]   Can we not think outside of our own consciousness
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.840]   and believe that there is something even more
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.420]   incredible or more complementary, more orthogonal?
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:28.820]   So I'm sometimes perplexed that people are trying
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.260]   to mimic human consciousness rather than think
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.020]   about creating something that's different.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.780]   - I think of human consciousness or consciousness in general
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   as this magic superpower that allows us
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.780]   to deeply experience the world.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.300]   And just as you're saying, I don't think that superpower
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.800]   has to take the exact flavor as humans have.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.880]   That's my love for robots.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.200]   I would love to add the ability to robots
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   that can experience the world and other humans deeply.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.880]   I'm humbled by the fact that that idea does not necessarily
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.360]   need to look anything like how humans experience the world.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   But there's a dance of human to robot connection,
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.560]   the same way human to dog or human to cat connection.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.760]   There's a magic there to that interaction.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.640]   And I'm not sure how to create that magic,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.160]   but it's a worthy effort.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.000]   I also love, just exactly as you said,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.480]   on the question of consciousness
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.140]   or engineering consciousness,
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:36.640]   the fun thing about this problem is it seems obvious to me
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.480]   that 100 years from now, no matter what we do today,
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.340]   people, if we're still here,
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.320]   will laugh at how silly our notions were.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.900]   So it's almost impossible for me to imagine
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.900]   that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:00.100]   And more than that, everything we'll do
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.620]   will be silly 100 years from now.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.660]   But it's still, that makes it fun to me
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.940]   because it's like you have the full freedom
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.260]   to not even be right, just to try,
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.900]   just to try is freedom.
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.300]   And that's how I see--
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.020]   - Get me that T-shirt, please.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.860]   (laughing)
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.700]   I love that.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.100]   - So, and human robot interaction is fascinating
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.260]   because it's like watching dancing.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.340]   I've been dancing tango recently.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:31.100]   And just, it's like, there is no goal.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.820]   The goal is to create something magical.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.620]   And whether consciousness or emotion
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.460]   or elegance of movement, all of those things,
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.380]   aid in the creation of the magic.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.060]   And it's a free, it's an art form to explore
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.900]   how to make that, how to create that
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.260]   in a way that's compelling.
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.480]   - Yeah, I love the line in "Sense of a Woman"
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.980]   with Al Pacino where he's speaking about the tango.
[00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.660]   And he said, "Really, it's just freedom
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:01.900]   "that if you get tangled up, you just keep tangoing on."
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.340]   - I still to this day, I think, well,
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.880]   first or second time I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.460]   I said, "We got into this heated argument
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.880]   "about whether 'Sense of a Woman'
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.700]   "is a better movie than 'John Wick'."
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.300]   Because it's one of my favorite movies for many reasons.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.940]   One is-- - "Sense of a Woman."
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.980]   - "Sense of a Woman."
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.260]   - Partially, I didn't know that, by the way.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.100]   I was just gonna--
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:26.940]   - You just--
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.240]   - Yeah, I didn't know if you would actually know
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.540]   of the movie. - Awesome, awesome.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.840]   No, yeah, I said, "I love the tango scene.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.600]   "I love Al Pacino's performance.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.880]   "It's a wonderful movie."
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.380]   Then Joe was saying, "John Wick is better."
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.460]   So we, to this day, argue about this.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.980]   - I think it depends on what conscious state you're in
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.980]   that you would be ready and receptive to.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.480]   But "Sense of a Woman," I think it has one of the best
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.900]   monologues at the end of the movie
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.060]   that has ever been written or at least performed.
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.980]   - When Al Pacino defends the younger.
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.940]   Yeah, I often think about that.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.000]   There's been times in my life, I don't know about you,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.600]   where I wish I had an Al Pacino in my life,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   where integrity is really important in this life.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.140]   - It is.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.820]   - And sometimes you find yourself in places
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.600]   where there's pressure to sacrifice that integrity.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.200]   And you want, what is it, Lieutenant Colonel
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.040]   or whatever he was--
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.620]   - (laughs) Slade.
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.800]   - Yeah, to come in on your side
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.340]   and scream at everyone and say,
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.520]   "What the hell are we doing here?"
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.280]   - Being, unfortunately, British
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.360]   and sort of having that slightly awkward
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.240]   sort of Hugh Grant gene, it's very, very,
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.800]   very at the opposite end of the spectrum
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.840]   of the remarkable feat of Al Pacino
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.080]   at the end of that scene.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   But, and yeah, integrity is, it's a challenging thing
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.300]   and I value it much.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:04.860]   And I think it can take 20 years to build a reputation
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.540]   and two minutes to lose it.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.380]   And there is nothing more that I value than integrity.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.540]   And if I'm ever wrong about anything,
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.980]   I truly don't want to be wrong
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:17.920]   for any longer than I have to be.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.660]   That's what being in some ways a scientist is.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.420]   You're just driven by truth.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.140]   And the irony relative to something like mathematics
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.860]   is that in science, you never find truth.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.420]   What all you do in science is you discount the things
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.980]   that are likely to be untrue,
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.180]   leaving only the possibility of what could be true.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   But in math, when you create a proof, it's a proof for,
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:54.260]   from that point forward, there is truth in mathematics.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.940]   And I think there's a beauty in that.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.180]   But I kind of like the messiness of science,
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.580]   because again, to me, it's less about the truth
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.220]   of the answer and it is more about the pursuit of questions.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:10.060]   - But their integrity becomes more and more important
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.780]   and it becomes more difficult.
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.900]   There's a lot of pressure,
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.060]   just like in the rest of the world,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.140]   but there's a lot of pressures on a scientist.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.420]   One is like funding sources.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.060]   I've noticed this, that money affects everyone's mind,
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.540]   I think.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.340]   I've been always somebody that I believe money can't,
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.500]   you can't buy my opinion.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.060]   I don't care how much money, billions or trillions.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.020]   But that pressure is there
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.740]   and you have to be very cognizant of it
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.660]   and make sure that your opinion is not defined
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.380]   by the funding sources.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:48.260]   And then the other is just your own success of,
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.740]   for a couple of decades, publishing an idea
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.460]   and then realizing at some point
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.900]   that that idea was wrong all along.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.820]   And that's a tough thing for people to do,
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.220]   but that's also integrity is to walk away,
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.820]   is to say that you were wrong.
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.900]   That doesn't have to be in some big dramatic way.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.940]   It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:17.700]   Like reconfigure your intuition about a particular problem.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.540]   And all of that is integrity.
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.500]   When everybody in the room believes a certain thing,
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.460]   everybody in the community believes a certain thing
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.020]   to be able to still be open-minded in the face of that.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.820]   - Yeah, and I think it comes down in some ways
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.340]   to the issue of ego,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.980]   that you bond your correctness or your rightness,
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.980]   your scientific theory with your sense of ego.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.780]   I've never found it that difficult to let go
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.780]   of theories in the face of counter evidence,
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.380]   in part because I have such low self-esteem.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.900]   - Well, I kind of like that.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.020]   I've always liked that combination.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.020]   I have the same.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.460]   I'm like very self-critical, imposter syndrome,
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.740]   all those things, putting yourself below the podium,
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.140]   but at the same time, having the ego
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:11.060]   that drives the ambition to work your ass off.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.860]   Like some kind of weird drive, maybe,
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.740]   like drive to be better.
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.940]   Like thinking yourself is not that great
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   and always driving to be better.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.020]   And at the same time,
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.940]   because that can be paralyzing and exhausting and so on,
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.340]   at the same time, just being grateful to be alive.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.340]   But in the sciences, in the actual effort,
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.940]   never be satisfied, never think of yourself highly.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.860]   It seems to be a nice combination.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.700]   - I very much hope that that is part of who I am,
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.420]   and I remain very quietly motivated and driven,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.980]   and I, like you, love the idea of perfection,
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.740]   and I know I will never achieve it,
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.380]   but I will never stop trying to.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.540]   - So similar to you, which sounds weird
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.420]   because there's all these videos of me on the internet.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   So I think I just naturally lean into the things
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.060]   I'm afraid of and I'm uncomfortable doing.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.180]   Like I'm very afraid of talking to people,
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.740]   and just even before talking to you today,
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.140]   just a lot of anxiety and all those kinds of things.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.580]   - About talking to me?
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:18.420]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.240]   - Oh, I like.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.080]   - Nervousness.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.580]   Fear in some cases, self-doubt and all those kinds of things
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.020]   but I do it anyway.
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:27.820]   So the reason I bring that up is
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.140]   you've launched a podcast.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:32.980]   - I have.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.440]   - Allow me to say,
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.420]   I think you're a great science communicator.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.220]   So this challenge of being
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:46.300]   afraid or cautious of being in the public eye
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.420]   and yet having a longing to communicate
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.620]   some of the things you're excited about
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.900]   in the space of sleep and beyond.
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.800]   What's your vision with this project?
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.780]   - I think firstly to that question,
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   like you, I am always more afraid of not trying than trying.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.820]   - Yeah.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.040]   - That to me frightens me more.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.980]   But with the podcast, I think really,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.640]   I have two very simple goals.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.000]   I want to try and democratize the science of sleep.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.020]   And in doing so, my goal would be to try
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.060]   and reunite humanity with the sleep
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.200]   that it is so desperately bereft of.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.820]   And if I can do that through a number of different means,
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:38.500]   the podcast is a little bit different than this format.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.500]   It's going to be short form monologues from yours, Julie,
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.820]   that will last usually less than just 10 minutes.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.460]   And I see it as simply a little slice of sleep goodness
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.980]   that can accompany your waking day.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.420]   - It's hard to know what is the right way
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.480]   to do science communication.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.660]   Like your friend, mine, Andrew Huberman,
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:05.500]   he's an incredible human being.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:06.340]   - Oh gosh.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.460]   - He does like two hours of,
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.060]   I wonder how many takes he does, I don't know.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.860]   But it looks like he doesn't do any.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:16.340]   - Yeah, I suspect he's that magnificent of a human being.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.980]   - When I talk to him in person,
[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.620]   he always generates intelligent words,
[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.260]   well cited nonstop for hours.
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.740]   So I don't.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.060]   - He's a Gatlin gun of information and it's pristine.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.700]   - And passion and all those kinds of things.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.420]   So that's an interesting medium.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.780]   It's funny 'cause I wouldn't have done it
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.060]   the way he's doing it.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.380]   I wouldn't advise him to do it the way he's doing it
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.380]   'cause I thought there's no way
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.860]   you could do what you're doing.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.580]   'Cause it's a lot of work,
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.460]   but he is like doing an incredible job of it.
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.100]   I just think it's the same with like Dan Carlin
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.300]   in hardcore history.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.740]   I thought that the way Andrew's doing it
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.900]   would crush him the way it crushes Dan Carlin.
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.720]   So Dan has so much pressure on him to do a good job
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.180]   that he ends up publishing like two episodes a year.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.140]   So that pressure can be paralyzing.
[00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:12.660]   The pressure of like putting out
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.180]   like strong scientific statements,
[00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.860]   that can be overwhelming.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.580]   Now, Andrew seems to be just plowing through anyway.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:22.860]   If there's mistakes,
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.260]   he'll say there's corrections and so on.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:26.280]   I just, I wonder,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.940]   actually I haven't talked to him too much about it.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.980]   Like psychologically,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.040]   how difficult is it to put yourself out there
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   for an hour to a week of just nonstop dropping knowledge?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.180]   Any one sentence of which could be totally wrong.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.020]   It could be a mistake.
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.580]   - And there will be mistakes.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.500]   And I, in the first edition of my book,
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.060]   there were errors that we corrected
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.540]   in the second edition too.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.900]   But there will be probabilistically,
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.140]   if you've got 10 facts per page of a book
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.520]   and you've got 350 pages,
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.320]   odds are it's probably not going to be
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.460]   utter perfection out the gate.
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.860]   And it will be the same way for Andrew too.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.800]   But having the reverence of a humble mind
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:22.000]   and simply accepting the things that are wrong
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.920]   and correcting them and doing the right thing,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.640]   I know that that's his mentality.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.260]   - I do want to say that I'm just kind of honored to be,
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.780]   it's a cool group of like scientific people
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.820]   that I'm fortunate enough to now be interacting with.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.180]   It's you and Andrew and David Sinclair
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.100]   has been thinking about throwing his hat in the ring.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:43.940]   - Oh, I hope so.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.740]   David is another one of those very special people
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.580]   in the world.
[00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.100]   - So it's cool because podcasts are, it's cool.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.460]   It's such a powerful medium of communication.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.540]   It's much freer than more constrained.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.400]   Like publications and so on,
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.260]   or it's much more accessible and inspiring
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.240]   than like, I don't know,
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.020]   conference presentations or lectures.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:06.900]   And so it's a really exciting medium to me.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:08.860]   And it's cool that there's this group of people
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:12.700]   that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.660]   and supporting each other.
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.800]   So it's fun to also watch
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.940]   how that's going to evolve in your case.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.860]   'Cause I wonder, it'll be two a month.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.980]   - Or devolve is the answer to that.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.700]   - Well, I mean, some of it is persistence
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.220]   through the challenges that we've been talking about,
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.060]   which is like-
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.460]   - I think I've got a lot to learn.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.300]   - Yeah.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.120]   - But I will persist.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.480]   - Luke, can I ask you some detailed stuff?
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:38.320]   You mentioned that one.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.600]   - Oh my goodness, go anywhere you wish with sleep.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.300]   - So I'm a big fan of coffee and caffeine.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.820]   And I've been, especially in the last few days,
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.140]   consuming a very large amount.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.340]   And I'm cognizant of the fact that
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.300]   my body is affected by caffeine
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.060]   different than the anecdotal information
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.780]   that other people tell me.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.940]   I seem to be not at all affected by it.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.780]   It's almost,
[00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:09.300]   it feels more like a ritual
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.180]   than it is a chemical boost to my performance.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.420]   Like I can drink several cups of coffee right before bed
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.780]   and just knock out anyway.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.260]   I'm not sure if it's a biological chemical
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.580]   or it has to do with just the fact
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:24.380]   that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.720]   All that to say,
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.580]   what do you think is the relationship
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.940]   between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.420]   If there's an interesting distinction there.
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:35.680]   - There is a distinction.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.620]   So I think the first thing to say,
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.220]   which is going to sound strange coming from me,
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.660]   is drink coffee.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:46.500]   The health benefits associated with drinking coffee
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.840]   are really quite well-established now.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.220]   But I think that the counterpoint to that,
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.860]   well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison,
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:01.260]   and I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second.
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.580]   So a lot of people have asked me
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.120]   about this rightful paradox between the fact
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.560]   that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.340]   and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.020]   on your sleep, has a whole collection of health benefits,
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.420]   many of them, Venn diagram overlapping
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.340]   with those that sleep provides.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.220]   How on earth can you reconcile those two?
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.780]   And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.740]   It's called antioxidants.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.860]   That it turns out that for most people
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.500]   in Western civilization, because of diet not being
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.580]   quite what it should be, the major source
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.160]   through which they obtain antioxidants
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.260]   is the coffee bean.
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.520]   So the humble coffee bean has now been asked
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.460]   to carry the astronomical weight of serving up
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:02.820]   the large majority of people's antioxidant needs.
[00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.500]   And you can see this if, for example,
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.100]   you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee.
[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.940]   It has a whole constellation
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.860]   of really great health benefits too.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.100]   So it's not the caffeine, and that's why I liked
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.460]   what you said, this sort of separation of church and state
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.660]   between coffee and caffeine.
[00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:24.100]   It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.600]   that provides those health benefits.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.320]   But coming back to how it impacts sleep,
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.100]   it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.580]   The first is that for most people,
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.960]   caffeine can make it obviously a little harder
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.700]   to fall asleep.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.580]   Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.620]   But let's say that you are one of those individuals,
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.540]   and I think you are, and you can say,
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.220]   "Look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner,
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.820]   and I fall asleep just fine,
[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.020]   and I stay asleep soundly across the night,
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.740]   so there's no problem."
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:00.320]   The downside there is that even if that is true,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.820]   the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.300]   And so you will actually lose somewhere between 10 to 30%
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   of your deep sleep if you drink caffeine in the evening.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.860]   So to give you some context, to drop your deep sleep
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.260]   by let's say 20%, I'd probably have to age you by 15 years,
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.540]   or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee.
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.380]   I think the fourth component that is perhaps
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.860]   less well understood about coffee is its timing,
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.100]   and that's why I was saying the timing
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.580]   and the dose make the poison.
[00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:34.540]   The dose, by the way, once you get past about three cups
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.700]   of coffee a day, the health benefits actually start
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.220]   to turn down in the opposite direction.
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.960]   So there is a U-shaped function.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.240]   It's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome,
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.060]   not too little, not too much, just the right amount.
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.720]   The second component is the timing, though.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.280]   Caffeine has half-life of about five to six hours,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.000]   meaning that after five to six hours, 50% of that,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.520]   on average, for the average adult, is still in the system,
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.080]   which means that it has a quarter-life of 10 to 12 hours.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.320]   So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon,
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.600]   a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.640]   in your brain at midnight.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   So having a cup of coffee at noon, one could argue,
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.080]   is the equivalent of tucking yourself into bed at midnight,
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.600]   and before you turn the light out,
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.200]   you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.320]   But that doesn't still answer your question
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.240]   as to why are you so immune?
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.200]   So I'm someone who is actually, unfortunately,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   very sensitive to caffeine, and if I have, you know,
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.120]   even two cups of coffee in the morning,
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.280]   I don't sleep as well that night,
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.680]   and I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee,
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.560]   I love the routine, I love the ritual,
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.240]   I think I would love to be invested in it.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.440]   It's just terrible for my sleep, so I switch to decaf.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:52.640]   There is a difference from one individual to the next,
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.640]   and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.720]   called cytochrome P450 enzymes,
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.040]   and there is a particular gene
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.640]   that if you have a different sort of version of this gene,
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.600]   it's called CYP1A2,
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.720]   that gene will determine the speed
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:18.080]   of the clearance of caffeine from your system.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.280]   Some people will have a version of that gene
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.040]   that is very effective and efficient
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.680]   at clearing that caffeine,
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.440]   and so their half-life could be as short as two hours
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.920]   rather than five to six hours.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.080]   Other people, hands up, Matt Walker,
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.760]   have a version of that gene that is not very effective
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.360]   at clearing out the caffeine,
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.680]   and therefore their half-life sort of sensitivity
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.120]   could be somewhere between eight to nine hours.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.760]   So we understand that there are individual differences,
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.440]   and understand that it's not the caffeine,
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:00.080]   it's the coffee that's the benefit,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.320]   and the dose makes the poison.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.920]   - Is there some aspect to it
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.320]   that's it's like a muscle in terms of the,
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.200]   all the combination of letters and numbers
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.080]   that you just said,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.880]   is there some aspect that if I can improve
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.720]   the quarter-life, the half-life,
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:19.040]   could decrease that number if I just practice?
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.360]   Like drink a lot of coffee,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.840]   is this like habit,
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.160]   alters how your body's able to get rid of the caffeine?
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   - Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:34.520]   but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.720]   And it's not at the level of the enzyme
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.800]   degrading the caffeine,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.520]   it's at the level of the receptors
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.120]   that caffeine will act upon.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.000]   Now, it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors,
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.120]   and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.200]   and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:55.280]   But as you start to drink more and more coffee,
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.000]   the body tries to fight back,
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.120]   and it happens with many different drugs, by the way,
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.160]   and it's called tolerance.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.680]   And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:10.160]   to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.400]   these sort of welcome sites,
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.320]   these sort of picture myths, as it were,
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   that receive the drug,
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:25.120]   And it's what we call receptor internalization.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.680]   So the cell starts to think,
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:30.120]   gee whiz, there's a lot of stimulation going on,
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.480]   this is too much.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.040]   So I'm just going to,
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.240]   when normally I would coat my cell with,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.680]   let's just say five of these receptors for argument's sake,
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.320]   things are going a little bit too ballistic right now.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.120]   I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   and downscale it to just having three of those.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.880]   And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.560]   that one cup of coffee got you before.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:00.560]   And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee,
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:05.400]   all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.560]   to expecting X amount of stimulation.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.160]   And now all of that stimulation is gone.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.960]   So it's now got too few receptors
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.680]   and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.520]   And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse,
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:22.600]   things like heroin, when people go into abstinence,
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.720]   as they're sort of moving into their addiction,
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.640]   they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:34.160]   So they need to take more of it to get the same high.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.160]   But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time,
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.640]   the system goes back to being more sensitive again.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.400]   It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.680]   with these receptors.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.680]   But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon,
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.360]   if they go back to the same dose that they were using
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:54.760]   before 10 weeks ago or three months ago,
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.560]   that dose can kill them.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:58.160]   They can have an overdose.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.360]   Even though they were using the same amount
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.280]   at those two different times,
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.820]   the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug,
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.160]   it's the sensitivity of the system.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.000]   And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.480]   In terms of training the muscle, as it were,
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.600]   is the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   - Is there a time, the number of hours before bed,
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:26.600]   that's a safe bet to most people to recommend
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.240]   you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.480]   Like, is there an average half-life
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.520]   that you should be aiming at?
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.080]   Or is this advice kind of impossible
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.640]   because there's so much variability?
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.300]   - There is huge variability.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.340]   And I think everyone themselves, to a degree, knows it.
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.020]   Although I'll put a caveat on that too,
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.460]   because it's a slightly dangerous point.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.220]   So the recommendation for the average adult,
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.700]   and where is the average adult in society?
[00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.580]   There is no such thing.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:58.500]   But for the average adult,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.380]   it would be probably cutting yourself off
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.900]   maybe 10 hours before.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.260]   So assuming a normative bedtime in society,
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:10.900]   I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m.
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.140]   and just keep an eye out.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.500]   And if you're struggling with sleep,
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:18.060]   dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:22.500]   - Can I ask you about sleep and learning?
[00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.420]   So how does sleep affect learning?
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   Sleep before learning, sleep after learning,
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.140]   which are both fascinating kind of dynamics
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.600]   of the mind's interaction with this extra-conscious state.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:42.300]   - Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.720]   to your memory systems and your informational systems.
[00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.820]   The first, as you just mentioned,
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.740]   is that sleep before learning
[00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.420]   will essentially prepare your brain
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.860]   almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of,
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.180]   you know, initially soak up new information.
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.220]   In other words, you need sleep before learning
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.940]   to effectively imprint information into the brain,
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.940]   to lay down fresh memory traces.
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.020]   And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain,
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.980]   and we know we've studied these memory circuits,
[00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.060]   will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.500]   as it were for the sponge analogy,
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:22.400]   and you can't absorb the information as effectively.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:26.340]   So you need sleep before learning,
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.220]   but you also need sleep, unfortunately, after learning too,
[00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.620]   to then take those freshly minted memories
[00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.260]   and effectively hit the save button on them.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:38.740]   But it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system.
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.140]   It takes hours because it's a physical biological change
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.060]   that happens at the level of brain cells.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:49.540]   But sleep after learning will cement and solidify
[00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.340]   that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain,
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:56.960]   therefore making it less likely to be forgotten.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:01.340]   So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as,
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:04.620]   it's almost sort of future-proofing information.
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:06.980]   - In what way?
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:10.340]   - Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:15.060]   of assurance to be remembered in the future
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:19.380]   rather than go through the sort of degradation
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.260]   that we think of as forgetting.
[00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:27.180]   So the brain has, in some ways by default, you know,
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.860]   there is forget, and actually I would love to,
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.900]   I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.700]   in three different ways, but I'm going to amend that
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.820]   and say there's four different ways
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:41.820]   which is learning, maintaining, memorizing,
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.580]   abstraction, assimilation, association,
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:50.420]   then forgetting, which the last one sounds oxymoronic
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.460]   based on the former three, but I'll see if I can explain.
[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.120]   So sleep after learning then sort of, you know,
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:02.140]   sets that information like amber in, you know,
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.980]   in solidification.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.460]   The third benefit, however, is that sleep,
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.260]   we've learned more recently is much more intelligent
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:12.340]   than we ever gave it credit for.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.980]   Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.580]   and strengthen them.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:21.900]   Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross-link
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.840]   and associate that information together.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.940]   And it's almost like informational alchemy
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.780]   so that you wake up the next morning
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.900]   with a revised mind wide web of associations.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.380]   And that's probably the reason that, you know,
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.920]   you've never been told to stay awake on a problem.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.860]   You know, and in every language
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.540]   that I've inquired about that phrase
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:49.580]   or something very similar seems to exist,
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.220]   which means to me that this creative associative benefit
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.740]   of sleep transcends cultural boundaries.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.740]   It is a common experience across humanity.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:05.180]   Now I should note that I think the French translation
[01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.420]   of that is much closer to,
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.060]   I think you sleep with a problem,
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.380]   whereas the British, you sleep on a problem.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.940]   The French, you sleep with a problem.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.100]   I think it says so much about the romantic difference
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.180]   between the British and the French,
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.740]   but let's not go there.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.500]   - That's brilliant.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.460]   So such a subtle, but such a fundamental difference.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.140]   - Oh, goodness.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.960]   Yeah, goodness me.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.340]   - Sleep with the problem.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.420]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.980]   - That's how I love the French.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:33.620]   So, and we can just sort of double click
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.420]   on any one of these and go into detail,
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.300]   but the fourth I became really enchanted
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.900]   by about eight years ago in our research,
[01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.920]   which was this idea of forgetting.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.940]   And I started to think that forgetting may be the price
[01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.620]   that we pay for remembering.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.500]   And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.560]   to letting go.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.460]   And you may be thinking that sounds ridiculous.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.780]   I don't want to forget.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.300]   In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things,
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.940]   but the brain has a, well, we believe,
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.540]   has a finite storage capacity.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:21.700]   We can't prove it yet,
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.480]   but my suspicion is that that's probably true.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.580]   It doesn't have an infinite storage capacity.
[01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.900]   It has constraints.
[01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:31.580]   If that's the case, we can't simply go through life
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:36.520]   being constantly informational aggregators,
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:41.340]   unless we are programmed to say we've got a hard drive space
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:44.820]   of about 85 to 90 years and we're good and we can do that.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.980]   Maybe that's true.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.960]   I don't think that's true.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.620]   I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.220]   So for example, it's not beneficial
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.140]   from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.380]   where I parked my car three years ago.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.780]   So it's important that I can remember today's parking spot,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.140]   but I don't want to have the junk kind of DNA
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:12.980]   from a memory perspective of where I parked my car
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.020]   two years ago.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.680]   Now, I actually have, in some ways,
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.740]   a problem with forgetting.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.520]   And again, I'm not trying to sort of be laudatory,
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:24.960]   but I tend not to forget too many things.
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.200]   And I don't think that that's a good thing.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.520]   And there's a wonderful neurologist, Luria,
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.400]   who wrote a book called "The Mind of the Mnemonicist."
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.920]   And it was a brilliant book,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.680]   both because it was written exquisitely,
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.840]   but he was studying these sort of memory savants
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.520]   who basically could remember everything that he gave them.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.640]   And he tried to find a chink in their armor.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.960]   And the first half of the book is essentially about him
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   seeing how far he can push them before they fail.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.840]   And he never found that place.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.840]   He could never find a place where they stopped remembering.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   And then in his brilliance,
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.160]   he turned the question on its head.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.480]   He said, "Not what is the benefit
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.680]   "of constantly remembering,
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.280]   "but instead what is the detriment to never forgetting?"
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.760]   And when you start to realize his descriptions
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.120]   of those individuals,
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.360]   it's probably a life that you would not want.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.960]   - But it's as fascinating, both from a human perspective,
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.560]   but also AI perspective.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:38.360]   There's a big challenge in the machine learning community
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.700]   of how to build systems that are able to remember
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.680]   for prolonged periods of time,
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.960]   lifelong continuous learning.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.160]   So where you build up information over time.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.240]   So memory is one of the biggest open problems
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:54.640]   in AI and machine learning.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.880]   But at the same time,
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.200]   the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.520]   because you have to be exceptionally selective
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.640]   at which kind of stuff you remember.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.480]   And that's where the step of assimilation,
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.000]   integration that you're referring to is really important.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.760]   I mean, we forget most of the things.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:16.720]   And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.440]   at the very edge of stuff that could be important
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.200]   or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.440]   Like for example, I've, you know, doing a podcast,
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.440]   I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.200]   that's been problematic,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:39.200]   which is I forget names and titles of books and so on.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.420]   So when I read, I remember ideas, I remember quotes,
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:48.900]   I remember statements and like that's the space
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.440]   in which I'm thinking.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.140]   But when you communicate to others,
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.740]   you have to say this person in this book said that.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.380]   So it's the same thing with like Andrew Huberman
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.200]   is masterful at this.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.580]   It's this important academia,
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.360]   remembering the authors of a paper
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.900]   and the title of the paper
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.140]   as part of remembering the idea.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:13.020]   And I've been feeling the cost of not being able
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.580]   to naturally remember those things.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.020]   And so that's something I need to sort of work on.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:20.140]   But that's an example. - Are you good with faces?
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.620]   - Yes, very good at faces.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.140]   - But not good with names.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.220]   So I'm exactly like you.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.520]   And there is, you know, an understanding of that
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.940]   in the brain too.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.660]   We understand that there is partitioning of those
[01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:33.340]   in terms of the territory of the brain
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.140]   that takes care of faces and facts and places
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.020]   and they can be separate.
[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.580]   So I will never forget a face,
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.020]   but, you know, and as I said,
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.540]   I usually forget very little,
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.660]   but for some reason names are a struggle.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.220]   I think in some ways because I'm probably
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.980]   just a slightly anxious person.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.220]   So when you first meet someone,
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.420]   which is usually the time when a name is introduced,
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.260]   you know, you were saying you were sort of anxious
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.780]   maybe about sort of sitting down with me,
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:04.420]   but I find that a little bit, you know, activating.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.860]   And so it's not as though there's anything wrong
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.700]   with my memory.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.500]   It's just the emotional state I'm in
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.340]   when I'm first meeting someone,
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.780]   you know, it's a little bit perturbing,
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.300]   but I will never forget that face.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.540]   - I completely relate to that
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.140]   because I almost don't hear people's names
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.420]   when they tell me because I'm so anxious.
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.900]   - Yeah.
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.300]   - But I think there's certain quirks of social interaction
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.460]   that show that you care about the person,
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.860]   that you remember that person,
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:33.580]   that they matter to you,
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.580]   that they had an impact on you.
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.980]   And one of the ways to show that
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.020]   is you remember their name.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.060]   But that's a quirk to me
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.460]   because there's a lot of people I meet
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.140]   have a deep impact on me,
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.700]   but I can't communicate that unless I know their name,
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:55.020]   unless I know some of the details
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.740]   that we humans seem to use to communicate
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.180]   that we remember each other.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.980]   What I remember well is the feeling we shared,
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.420]   is the experience we shared.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.700]   What I don't remember well
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:12.100]   is the detailed labels of those experiences.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.060]   And I need to certainly work on that.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:15.060]   - I don't know.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.220]   I think it's, you know,
[01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.300]   just allowing yourself to be innate
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.700]   and who you are is also a beautiful thing too.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.580]   I'm not suggesting it's not important
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.900]   to try and better oneself,
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.780]   but I also sometimes worry about the misery
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:31.060]   that that puts us in.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.860]   But like you, I will.
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.980]   I do struggle with it.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.940]   But I know the first time when we met in the lobby,
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:43.700]   I know exactly what you look like.
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.260]   I know that you were wearing headphones.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.620]   I know the shape and the size of those headphones.
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:49.060]   You didn't have your black jacket on.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.660]   I know exactly what the weave of your shirt looked like.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.700]   I know what your shoes look like.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.060]   And I knew exactly the height of your,
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.580]   the end of your pants from the top of your shoes.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.420]   And so those things I don't forget, you know,
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.780]   and I can remember when people,
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.980]   I met people, you know, two years ago and I'll say,
[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:08.340]   oh yes, we met there.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:12.340]   And I remember you had those fantastic, you know, boots on.
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.740]   I thought they were a bloody great pair of boots,
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.940]   you know, and they're like, how do you,
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:18.620]   I didn't even remember what I was wearing that day.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.780]   - It's fascinating.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.100]   Yeah, I'm the exact the same way,
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.580]   but you can't until we have Neuralink
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.420]   or something like that,
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.380]   we can't communicate that you remember all those things.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.980]   - I know, that's what I want.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.860]   - So you have to be able to use tricks
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.460]   of human communication for that.
[01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.780]   But so that, I mean, that's the,
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.740]   it's ultimately is a trick of like,
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.420]   which to remember, which to forget.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.260]   - Right.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.620]   - And the forgetting is so,
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:41.060]   it's so fascinating you say this.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:44.500]   I mean, it seems to be deeply connected
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.660]   to that assimilation process.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:50.620]   So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:55.020]   into this big web of the old stuff
[01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:58.260]   and the things that don't fit, you throw out.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.020]   - I think the assimilation,
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.100]   the way I've been thinking about it with sleep
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.700]   and it's particularly sort of dream sleep
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.140]   that we think can help with this assimilation
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.620]   is that during wake,
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.540]   we have one version of associative processing.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.380]   And what I mean by that
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:17.180]   is we see the most obvious connections.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:22.180]   So I think of wakefulness as a Google search gone right.
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:26.620]   Whereas I see dream sleep
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:29.580]   as doing something very different.
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.180]   I think dream sleep is a little bit
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:33.660]   like group therapy for memories,
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.020]   that everyone gets a name badge
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:39.340]   and sleep gathers in all of the individual pieces
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.180]   of the day.
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.620]   And it sort of starts to get you to,
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.660]   forces you in fact, to speak to the people,
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.700]   not at the front of the room
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.180]   that you think you've got the most obvious connection with,
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.700]   but to speak with the people all the way
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.580]   at the back of the room,
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:53.180]   that at first you think I've got no obvious connection
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.460]   with them at all.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.620]   But once you get chatting with them,
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.900]   you learn that you do have
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.940]   a very distant non-obvious connection,
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.700]   but it's still a connection on the same.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.300]   And it's almost as though you're doing a Google search
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.660]   where I input Lex Friedman
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:12.140]   and it doesn't take me to the first page of your home site.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.980]   - Page 20.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:13.860]   - It takes me to page 20,
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.940]   which is about some like field hockey game in Utah.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:17.780]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.580]   - It turns out that there actually is a link
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:22.340]   if I look at it, it's a distant non-obvious one.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.180]   And to me, I find that exciting
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.860]   because when you fuse things together
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:27.760]   that shouldn't normally go together,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.100]   but when they do, they cause marked advances
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.600]   in evolutionary fitness.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.940]   It sounds like the biological basis of creativity.
[01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:37.500]   And that's exactly what I think DreamSleep
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.460]   and the algorithm of DreamSleep is designed to do.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.580]   You know, it's not a Boolean like system
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.060]   where you have, you know,
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:49.020]   the sort of assumptions of true and false,
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.020]   you know, maybe it's more fuzzy logic system.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:55.140]   And I think REM sleep is a perfect environment
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.820]   within which we do, you know,
[01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.940]   it's almost like memory pinball.
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.260]   You know, you get the information
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:02.100]   that you've learned during the day,
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.420]   and then you pull the lever back
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.000]   and you shoot it up into the attic of your brain.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.700]   You know, this cortex filled
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.300]   with all of your past historical knowledge,
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.680]   and you start to bounce it around
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.540]   and see where one of those things lights up
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.780]   and you build a new connection there
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.500]   and you build another one there too.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.780]   You're developing schemas.
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.340]   And so in that way, I think you could argue,
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:25.540]   you know, we dream, therefore we are.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:27.100]   (laughing)
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.140]   - Yeah, so in terms of this line between learning
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.020]   and thinking through a new thing
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.460]   that seems to be deeply connected,
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.980]   there's this legendary engineer named Jim Keller
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.820]   who keeps yelling at me about this.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.900]   He says it's very effective.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:49.340]   He likes to, for difficult problems before bed,
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:51.100]   think about that difficult problem.
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.880]   We're not talking about like drama at work
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.020]   or all that kind of stuff.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.900]   No, like a scientific, for him, engineering problem.
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.220]   He likes to intensely think about it
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:05.740]   and to prime his mind before sleep and then go to sleep.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.860]   And then he finds that the next day,
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.020]   he's able to think much clearer
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.380]   and there's new ideas that come,
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.820]   but also just, I guess it's more well-integrated.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.200]   And sometimes during the process of,
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   like he's able to like wake up and like see new insights.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.820]   - That's right.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.220]   - If he's deeply sort of aggressively
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:30.420]   thinking through a problem.
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:33.480]   - So there's many scientific, you know,
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.260]   demonstrations of this, you know,
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.260]   the Mendeleev with the periodic table of elements,
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:42.260]   you know, he was trying for months to understand.
[01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.840]   I mean, talk about an ecumenical problem
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.900]   of epic proportions.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.980]   Here's your question today.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.920]   You have to understand how all of the known elements
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.640]   in the universe fit together in a logical way.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.120]   Good luck, take care.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.860]   It was non-trivial at the time.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.680]   And he would try and try, he was so obsessed with it.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.940]   He created playing cards
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.600]   with all of the different elements on.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.280]   And then he would go on these long train journeys
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.760]   around Europe and he would just sort of deal these cards
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.200]   in front of them and he would shuffle them,
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.180]   shuffling and shuffling.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.680]   And he would just try to see if he could find
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.400]   what the answer was.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.640]   And then, so the story goes, you know,
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.120]   he fell asleep and he had a dream.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:28.480]   And in that dream, you know, all of these elements
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.420]   started to dance and play around
[01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.120]   and they snapped into a logical grid, you know,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.680]   atomic weights, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   And it wasn't his waking brain that solved the problem.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.120]   It was his sleeping brain that solved
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.960]   the impenetrable problem that his waking brain could not.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.920]   And there's been count, you know, even in the arts
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:52.720]   and in music, some wonderful dreams, you know,
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.080]   Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's epic Gothic novel
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.180]   came to her in a dream at Lord Byron's home.
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.500]   And then we've got, you know, Paul McCartney.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:08.520]   Yesterday, the song came to him in a dream.
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.760]   He was filming, gosh, what was the movie?
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.840]   I don't recall it.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.360]   I should be shot because I'm from Liverpool myself.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.360]   And, but he was on Wimpole Street in London and filming.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.560]   And they, he came up with that song,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.680]   the melody in his sleep, not to be outdone by the Beatles.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.360]   And by the way, "Let It Be" also came from a dream
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.480]   that McCartney had.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.000]   People usually give it, you know, religious overtones.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   You know, mother Mary comes to me
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.440]   If you've ever asked who mother Mary is,
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   it's not the, you know, the biblical content.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.280]   It's his mother.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.360]   It's Mary McCartney.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.960]   And she came to him in a dream and gifted him the song.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.120]   But the best story I've heard is not to be outdone
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   by the Beatles, the Stones, Keith Richards,
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.840]   who I think once was suggested, who was it?
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.160]   It was a comedian who was saying that in an interview
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.920]   with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards suggested or inferred
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.800]   that young kids should not do drugs.
[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:25.800]   And they said, well, look, young kids can't do drugs
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.640]   because you've done all of them.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.480]   - All of them, yeah.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.040]   - And I always thought that, but Keith Richards described,
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.880]   he would always go to bed with his guitar
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.600]   and a tape recorder.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.640]   And then probably he would have a whole set
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:43.960]   of other things in the bed with him.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.480]   And who knows how many other people, but anyway.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.800]   And then he said in his autobiography,
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.120]   and I'm paraphrasing here, but one morning I woke up
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.200]   and I realized that the tape had recorded
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.640]   all the way to the end.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.800]   So I rewound the tape and I hit play.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:06.000]   And there in some kind of ghostly form
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.880]   were the opening chords to "Satisfaction,"
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.280]   the most famous successful Rolling Stone song
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.520]   of all time.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.240]   Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.960]   - That's awesome.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.520]   - But that riff came to him,
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.920]   one of the most famous riffs in all of rock and roll
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.480]   came to him by way of a dream inspired insight.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.320]   So I think there is too many of those anecdotes
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.440]   and we've now got the science,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.960]   I don't rely on anecdotes as science.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.840]   We've now done the studies in the laboratory
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.600]   and we can reliably demonstrate
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.360]   that sleep inspires creativity,
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.840]   inspires problem solving capacity.
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.120]   - Well, the interesting thing is,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.800]   is it possible to some of the ideas that you talk about
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.320]   to turn them into a protocol
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.960]   that could be practiced rigorously?
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.400]   So what Jim Keller espouses is saying,
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:56.880]   not just the fact that sleep helps you
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.440]   increase the creativity, but turn it into a process.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.880]   Like literally, like don't do it accidentally.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.680]   You know, like an athlete does certain things
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.160]   to optimize their performance.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.720]   They have a training routine, they have a regimen
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   of like cycling and sprints and long distance stuff.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:22.320]   In the same way, thinking about your job
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.280]   as an idea generator in the engineering space
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:27.600]   is like, this is good for my performance.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.880]   So like for an hour before bed,
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.200]   think through a problem like every night
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.680]   and then use sleep to work through that problem.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.200]   I mean, he's the first person that I heard
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.680]   like of the people I really respect that do like what I do,
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.240]   which is like programming engineering type work,
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.200]   like using sleep, not accidentally,
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.720]   but with a purpose, like using sleep.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.880]   You know, that's just basically the difference between,
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.520]   as you said, a passive approach to it
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.840]   versus an active deterministic
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.000]   or hope for a deterministic approach to it.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.440]   In other words, that you are actually trying to harness
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.360]   the power of sleep in a deliberate way
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.960]   rather than an unthoughtful way.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:17.240]   I still think that, you know, mother nature through it,
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.240]   you know, 3.6 million years of evolution
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.560]   has probably got it mostly figured out
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.960]   in terms of what information should be uploaded at night
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.080]   and worked through.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:31.280]   I think her algorithm is probably pretty good at this stage.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.080]   It's not to suggest though that, you know,
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.640]   we can't try to tweak it and nudge it.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.520]   You know, it's a very light hand on the tiller
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.000]   is what he's doing.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.560]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.480]   - You know, just like, for example, for me,
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.400]   fasting has improved my ability to focus deeply
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.680]   and productivity significantly.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.560]   And in that same way, you know,
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.480]   it's possible that playing with these ideas
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.920]   of thinking before bed or some hours before bed,
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.280]   or some playing with different protocols
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.000]   will have a significant leap
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.280]   over what mother nature naturally does.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.640]   So if you let your body do what it naturally does,
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.320]   you may not achieve the same level of performance
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:12.920]   'cause mother nature has not designed us
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.480]   to think deeply about chip design
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.560]   or programming artificial intelligence systems.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:23.160]   - Well, she's gifted us the architecture
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.600]   and the capacity to do that.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.080]   What we do with that is, you know,
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.520]   is what life's experience dictates.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.480]   She gives us the blueprint to do many, you know.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.400]   - Well, if I were to sort of introspect
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.960]   and self-analyze what mother nature wants me to do,
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.840]   I think given my current lifestyle
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.240]   that I have food in the fridge and a bed to sleep on,
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.240]   I think what mother nature wants me to do is to be lazy.
[01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:51.320]   (both laughing)
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.760]   And so I think I'm actually resisting mother nature
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:59.680]   because so many of my needs are satisfied.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.320]   And so I have to resist some of the natural forces
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:07.920]   of the body and the mind when I do some of the things I do.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.520]   So there's that dance.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.880]   You know, like I've been thinking about doing a startup
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.280]   and that's obviously going against everything
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.080]   that my body and mind are telling me to do
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:21.240]   because it's going to be basically suffering.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.720]   But the only reason I want--
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.680]   - As you know it, we'll be over.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.320]   (both laughing)
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.160]   - Yes.
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.120]   But nevertheless, there's some kind of inner drive
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.000]   that wants me to do it.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.760]   And then you start to ask the question,
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.520]   well, how do you optimize the things you can optimize
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.120]   like sleep, like diet,
[01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.360]   like the people that you surround yourself with
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.520]   in order to maximize happiness and performance
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.040]   and all those kinds of things without also over-optimizing.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.040]   And that's such an interesting idea from an engineer.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.480]   So as you may know,
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.580]   you don't often get those kinds of ideas from engineers.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:04.060]   Engineers usually just don't read books about sleeping.
[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:09.060]   They're usually like, they're not the healthiest of people.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:13.100]   I think that's changing over time,
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.100]   especially with Silicon Valley,
[01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.500]   especially with the tech sector,
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.700]   people are starting to understand
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.300]   what's a healthy lifestyle.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.020]   But usually they're kind of on the insane side,
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.700]   especially programmers.
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:27.460]   But it's nice to hear somebody like that use sleep
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.420]   and use some of the things you talk about,
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.940]   strategically, on purpose.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:36.820]   - You know, to that idea of not just trying to use
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.980]   what mother nature gave,
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.980]   but seeing if you can do something more or different.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:47.940]   In a conservative mindset,
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:52.500]   I would then pose the question at what cost?
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.720]   Because when you do something perhaps that deviates
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.340]   from the typical pre-programmed, you know,
[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.460]   mother nature's program,
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:07.940]   I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:12.500]   So maybe he is able to direct and focus
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:16.620]   his sleeping cognition on those particular topics
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:20.380]   that will gain him better problematic resolution
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:22.300]   the next day when he wakes up.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.900]   The question is though, at what cost of the other things
[01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:28.480]   that didn't make it onto the menu
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.000]   of the finger buffet of sleep that night?
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.360]   And is it that you don't process
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.560]   the emotional difficulties or events,
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.280]   and therefore you are less emotionally resolved
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.120]   the next day, but you are more problem resolved
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.360]   the following day?
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.960]   And so I always try to think,
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.680]   and I truly don't want to sound puritanical
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:52.760]   either about sleep.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.100]   And I think I've come off that way many a time,
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:58.600]   especially when I started out in the public.
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.340]   The tone of the book in some ways, you know,
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.340]   I look back and think, could I have been a little softer?
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.500]   And the reason was I was that way back in,
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.700]   but when I started writing the book,
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.400]   which was probably something like 2014 or '15,
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:18.660]   sleep was the neglected step-sister
[01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:21.500]   in the health conversation of the day.
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.360]   And I was just so sad to see the amount of suffering
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.480]   and disease and sickness that was caused
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:29.640]   by insufficient sleep.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:33.080]   And for years before I'd been doing public speaking
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.000]   and I'd tell people about the great things
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.320]   that happen when you get sleep,
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.940]   people would say, that's fascinating.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.000]   And then they would go back and keep doing the same thing
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.800]   about not sleeping enough.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.720]   And then I realized you can't really speak
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.840]   about the good things that happen.
[01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.040]   It's like the news, what bleeds leads.
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.340]   And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.000]   that happen, people tend to have a behavioral change.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.400]   And so the book as a consequence,
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.880]   I think probably came out a little bit on the strong side
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.640]   of trying to convince people.
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.120]   - You were trying to help a lot of people
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.760]   and that's a powerful way to help a lot of people.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.520]   - I was genuinely trying to help people,
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.160]   but certainly for some people for whom sleep
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.680]   does not come easy, then it was probably
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.520]   a tricky book to read too.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.660]   And I think I feel more sensitive to those people now
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.600]   and empathetically connected to them.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.660]   So I think the, again, the point was simply
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:32.580]   that I don't mean to sound too puritanical in all of this.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.900]   And the same way with caffeine and coffee,
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.780]   I am just a scientist and I am not here to tell anyone
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.980]   how to live their life.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:44.020]   That is not my job at all.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.180]   And life is to be lived to a degree.
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:50.160]   And life is to be lived if you want to do a startup.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.700]   All I want to do is empower people with the understanding
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.500]   of the science of sleep.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.360]   And then you can make an informed choice
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.020]   as to how you want to live your life.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:03.620]   And I offer no judgment on how anyone
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.540]   wishes to live their life.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.620]   I just want to try and see if the information
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:12.060]   that I have about sleep would alternatively change
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.740]   how you would think about your life decisions.
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:15.460]   And if it doesn't, no problem.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.300]   And if it does, I hope it's been of use.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:21.300]   Well, maybe this is me trying to justify
[01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.900]   my lifestyle to you.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:27.420]   But Dr. Seuss said, "You know you're in love
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.580]   "when you can't fall asleep because reality
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.900]   "is finally better than your dreams."
[01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.580]   - I love that quote too.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:35.420]   - Okay.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:42.000]   My sleeping schedule is complicated.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.020]   And it has to do primarily with the fact
[01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.620]   that I love basically everything that I do.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:53.560]   And that love takes a form that may not appear
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.700]   to be love from the external observer perspective.
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.820]   'Cause it often includes struggle.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.200]   It often includes something that looks like stress,
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.820]   even though it's not stress.
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.980]   It's like this excitement, it's this turmoil
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:11.220]   and chaos of passion, of struggling with a problem,
[01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.980]   of being sad and down to the point even depressed
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.660]   of how difficult the problem is, the disappointment
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:22.100]   that the last few weeks and months have been a failure
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:25.340]   and self-doubt, all that mix.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.180]   But I love it.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.380]   And a part of that is sometimes staying up all night
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.260]   working on a thing I'm really passionate about.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.500]   And that means sleep schedules that are just like,
[01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.860]   sometimes sleeping during the day,
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:43.260]   sometimes very often sleeping very little,
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:45.780]   but taking naps that are like an hour or two hours
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.620]   or so on, that kind of weird chaos.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:54.260]   Now, I'll also try to give myself backup.
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:56.220]   I was trying to like research yesterday,
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:59.700]   is anybody else productive while like this?
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:02.180]   And there's of course a lot of anecdotal evidence
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:05.860]   and some of it could be just narratives
[01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.820]   that people have told to the public
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:09.900]   when in reality they sleep way more,
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.980]   but there's a bunch of people that are famous
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:16.380]   for not sleeping much.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:21.380]   So on the topic of naps, I read this a long time ago
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:26.340]   and I checked this, Churchill was big on big naps
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:30.100]   and is actually just reading more about Winston Churchill's
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.060]   sleep schedule is very much like mine.
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.940]   So I basically wanna give myself the opportunity
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:40.780]   to at night, to stay up all night if I want to.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:44.820]   And a good nap is a big part of that in the late evening.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.100]   Like I'll often, that just destroys social life completely,
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:52.020]   but I'll often take a nap in the late afternoon
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.060]   or the evening and that sets me
[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:56.580]   if I want to stay up all night.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:00.700]   And things like that, like I read that Nikola Tesla
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:05.180]   slept only two hours a night, Edison the same three hours,
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.700]   but he actually did the polyphasic sleep
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:10.260]   like where it's just a bunch of naps.
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   What can you say about this madness of love and passion,
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:18.940]   of loving everything you do
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:22.260]   and the chaos of sleep that might result in?
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.140]   - I love the Seuss quote.
[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:30.220]   And I've had that experience too, like you,
[01:29:30.220 --> 01:29:33.140]   I adore what I do.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:37.700]   If someone gave you enough money
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:40.260]   to live the rest of your life,
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.260]   got a roof above my head, rice and beans on the table,
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.260]   and they said, "You don't have to work anymore,"
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.900]   I would do nothing different.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:48.780]   I would do exactly, you know,
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.940]   this sounds a little crass
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:53.820]   and I hope it doesn't sound this way,
[01:29:53.820 --> 01:29:58.820]   but being a scientist is not what I do, it's who I am.
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:01.660]   It's not what I do, it's who I am.
[01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.620]   And when that's the case,
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:11.180]   sleep, working out, showering and eating
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:16.180]   are the things that I do in between my love affair with sleep.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.380]   I fell for sleep like a blind roofer.
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:28.340]   And it was a love affair that started 20 years ago
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:33.140]   and I remain utterly besotted today.
[01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:37.460]   It's the most beguiling thing in the world to me.
[01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.420]   And I could easily, and I have, you know,
[01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:41.580]   it's kept me up at night.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.180]   When my mind is fizzing with experimental ideas
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:47.420]   or I think I've got a new hypothesis or theory,
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.140]   I will struggle with sleep, I really will.
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:52.380]   It doesn't come easy to me
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:56.580]   because my mind is just so on fire with those ideas.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.940]   So I understand the struggle,
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:06.220]   but I couldn't advocate from a scientific perspective
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:09.740]   the schedule because the science just doesn't,
[01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:14.860]   I would feel as though I'm doing you a disservice
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:19.860]   to say it's okay, that won't come with some blast radius,
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:23.060]   some health consequences.
[01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:25.540]   You can add Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:26.700]   to that list too.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.900]   Both of them were very, you know, proud chess beaters
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.300]   of how little sleep that they get.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:35.300]   Thatcher said four hours, Reagan, something similar,
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.180]   you know, and I, knowing the links that we now know
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:39.860]   between sleep and Alzheimer's disease,
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:42.940]   I've often wondered whether it was coincidental then
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:46.380]   that both of them died of the terrible disease of Alzheimer's
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.420]   meaning, you know, maybe it doesn't get you
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.140]   by way of, you know, being popped out of the gene pool
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.420]   in a car accident 'cause you had a microsleep at the wheel
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:58.420]   at age 32, or it doesn't get you at 42 with, you know,
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:03.820]   heart attack or even 52 with cancer or a stroke,
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.700]   maybe it gets you in your 70s.
[01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.780]   I think the elastic band of sleep deprivation
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:10.780]   can stretch only so far before it snaps
[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:12.980]   and it ultimately seems to snap.
[01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:16.640]   You know, Nikola Tesla, I think he,
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:21.740]   Nikola Tesla, he, I think died of a coronary thrombosis,
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.420]   I believe, and there was a wonderful study
[01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:26.580]   done out of Harvard where they took a group of people
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:30.260]   who had no signs of cardiovascular disease.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:33.020]   And what they found is that when they track them
[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:36.420]   for years afterwards, they were completely healthy
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:38.380]   to begin with, those people who were getting
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:40.900]   less than six hours of sleep ended up having
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:44.980]   a 300% increased risk of developing calcification
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:48.420]   of the coronary artery, which is the major
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.460]   sort of corridor of life for your heart
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:54.820]   when someone says, you know, he died of a massive coronary,
[01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:58.140]   it's because of a blockade of the coronary artery,
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.340]   you know, and Tesla, you know, passed away
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.540]   from a coronary thrombosis.
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.140]   We also know that insufficient sleep
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.400]   is linked to numerous mental health issues.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.380]   We know that Churchill had a wicked battle with depression.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:13.260]   Gosh, my goodness, he used to call it black dog
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:15.100]   that would come and visit him.
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:18.300]   And I think many of his paintings, he was exquisite painter,
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.820]   but some of them would depict his darkness
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:22.840]   with depression as well.
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.140]   You know, Edison is interesting.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.620]   People have argued that he would short sleep
[01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:30.300]   and he didn't put much value in sleep,
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.780]   whether or not that's true, we don't know,
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:33.540]   but he was a habitual napper, you're right,
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.340]   during the day, I've got some great pictures of him
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.340]   on his inventor's bench taking a nap.
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.100]   And in fact, I believe he set up nap cots around his house
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.740]   so he could nap.
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.740]   But what we also know is that he, again,
[01:33:44.740 --> 01:33:47.860]   coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago,
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.580]   demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:52.980]   is associated with worse physical outcomes,
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.460]   worse cognitive outcomes, and especially worse mood outcomes.
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.900]   So from that sense, you know,
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.660]   sleeping like a baby is not perfect for adults.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:05.700]   - There's a fascinating dance here
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.100]   of the mean and the extreme,
[01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:13.180]   like the average and the high performers.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:14.020]   So I,
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.420]   this gets to like the meaning of life kind of discussion,
[01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:24.140]   but let's go there.
[01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.900]   So, well, and also happiness.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:29.500]   So when studying sleep and when studying anything
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.700]   like diet and exercise,
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:35.900]   I think you have to really get a lot more data
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:40.900]   about individuals to make a conclusive statement.
[01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:44.380]   When people talk about like, is meat,
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:47.060]   red meat good for you or bad for you, right?
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:50.660]   It's just so often correlated with other life decisions
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.060]   when you choose to eat meat or not.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:58.060]   My sense is that whatever life decisions you make,
[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:03.500]   if they reduce stress and lead to happiness,
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:06.300]   that's also going to be a big boost
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.020]   that needs to be integrated into the plots in the science.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:09.860]   Right?
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.300]   So I'll give you an example of somebody
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:15.300]   who is unarguably seen as unhealthy.
[01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.940]   My friend, Mr. David Goggins.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:22.980]   So he's clearly, obviously,
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.240]   almost on purpose destroying his body.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:30.700]   And to say that he's doing the wrong thing
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:35.700]   or the unhealthy thing feels wrong.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:41.580]   But I'm not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong.
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.700]   One of the things I'm bothered by,
[01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:47.100]   and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions,
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:53.420]   a framework of this, but I'm bothered by the fact
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:58.140]   that a lot of people tell me or David
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:35:59.740]   that they're doing things wrong.
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:05.260]   A lot of people in my life, when they see me not sleep,
[01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.260]   they'll tell me to sleep more.
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.620]   Now they're correct.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:15.540]   But one fundamental aspect that I'd like to complain about
[01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:20.180]   is not enough people, almost nobody,
[01:36:20.180 --> 01:36:22.460]   especially people that care for me,
[01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:24.240]   will come to me and say,
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:29.540]   "You have a dream, work harder."
[01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:39.700]   It's like the healthy thing should be a component
[01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.340]   of a life well-lived.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.180]   - Right.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.420]   - But not everything.
[01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:45.820]   And I don't know what to do with that
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:48.540]   because you certainly don't want to espouse it.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:51.380]   And just like you said, when you were working in your book,
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.900]   there is a belief, sleep was a secondary citizen
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:59.100]   in the full spectrum of what's a healthy life.
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:02.340]   But at the same time, I'm bothered by in Silicon Valley
[01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:05.580]   and all these kinds of work environments
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.460]   that I get to work with with engineers
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.060]   is there's, to me, too much focus on work-life balance.
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:16.100]   What that usually starts meaning is like,
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.460]   yeah, yeah, of course, it's good to have a social life,
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.540]   it's good to have a family,
[01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.320]   it's good to eat well and sleep well,
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.460]   but we should also discover our passion.
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:30.140]   We should also give ourself a chance
[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.860]   to work our ass off towards a dream
[01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.940]   and make mistakes and take big risks
[01:37:36.940 --> 01:37:40.060]   that in the short term seem to sacrifice health.
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.860]   - And I think, to come back to how you started
[01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:45.340]   about David Goggins, who I've never met,
[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.180]   but who I admire incredibly
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.900]   and have an immense reverence for the man,
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.740]   you said two things.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:58.740]   Is it wrong to do those things to yourself?
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.700]   And is it unhealthy to do those things to yourself?
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:07.700]   - I disagree with the former and I agree with the latter.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:10.900]   So from a health biological medicine perspective,
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:14.740]   sleeping in the way that you've described
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.340]   or that other people may be sleeping
[01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:18.140]   in terms of insufficient amounts,
[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:24.340]   now, to your point, too, about inter-individual differences,
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:27.140]   usually when I see a bar graph and a mean,
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.380]   I usually say, show me your variance.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:32.140]   I want to see your variance.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.420]   In other words, show me the distribution of that effect.
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.940]   How many people were below the mean?
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.980]   How many, is it all tightly clustered around this one thing?
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.620]   So it's a very robust effect.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:44.540]   Or was this huge fan of effect where for some people,
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:46.260]   there was no effect at all and other people,
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.020]   there was a whopping effect and everything in between.
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.700]   So I don't discount inter-individual variability.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.820]   But, and I will come back to those two points
[01:38:56.820 --> 01:38:59.600]   about is it wrong and is it unhealthy in just a second.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.440]   When it comes to sleep, we have found huge amounts
[01:39:02.440 --> 01:39:04.680]   of inter-individual differences
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.240]   in your response to a lack of sleep.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.480]   But one of the fascinating things,
[01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:10.920]   so let's say that I take you
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.280]   and we're going to measure your attention,
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.960]   your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure,
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.200]   your blood sugar glucose regulation,
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.660]   your autonomic nervous system,
[01:39:20.660 --> 01:39:22.400]   and your different gene expression.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.760]   Let's say I'm just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   of different outcomes, brain and body.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.180]   And I find that on our measure of cognition,
[01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.640]   on your attentional ability to focus,
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:35.220]   you are very resilient.
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:37.120]   You just don't show any impairments at all,
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.040]   even after being awake for 36 hours straight.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.560]   Does that mean that you are resilient
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.600]   in all of those other domains as well?
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.420]   The answer is no, you're not.
[01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:48.840]   So you can be resilient in one,
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.600]   but very vulnerable in another.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:56.160]   And we've not found anyone who isn't at least vulnerable
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.360]   in one of those domains.
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.320]   Meaning that it's somewhat safe to say
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.480]   that not getting sufficient sleep
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.360]   will lead to some kind of impairment
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.040]   in anyone given individual.
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:10.560]   It may not be the same impairment,
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:12.680]   but it's likely to be an impairment.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.500]   But to come back to the question,
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.800]   I think it's wrong to tell anyone
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.320]   that it's wrong to do what they're doing,
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.760]   even if they are compromising their sleep,
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.840]   even if they're compromising their mental health.
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.620]   As long as they're not hurting anyone else,
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:33.020]   then I think the answer is that's that person's choice.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.220]   - Yeah, but that's that person's life.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.620]   - I'd like to push back further.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:38.060]   So see the way you kind of said it,
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:41.740]   yes, you're absolutely right.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:45.460]   But I would like to say a stronger statement,
[01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:49.420]   which is you should let go of that judgment
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:53.220]   of somebody is wrong and allow yourself to be inspired
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.900]   by the great heights they have reached.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:59.980]   So take yourself out of the seat of being a judger
[01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:01.420]   of what is healthy or not,
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.260]   and appreciate the greatness of a particular human.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:07.020]   You watch the Olympics,
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:09.100]   the kind of things that some athletes do
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.780]   to reach the very heights.
[01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:15.020]   The Olympics are taking years off their life.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:18.540]   They suffer depression after the Olympics often.
[01:41:18.540 --> 01:41:21.100]   - Their physiology is disastrous.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.620]   - Everything, their personal life,
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:27.900]   their psychology, their physiology, everything.
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:29.060]   It's a giant mess.
[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:31.600]   So the question is about life.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:37.860]   Healthy now means longevity,
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:42.060]   quality of life over a prolonged period of time,
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:46.300]   optimal performance over a prolonged period of time.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.300]   But to me, beauty is reaching great heights.
[01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:54.100]   And there's a dance there
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:56.220]   that sometimes reaching great heights
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.300]   requires sacrifice of health
[01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:01.420]   and not like a calculation
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.100]   where you sat down on a sheet of paper and say,
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:05.700]   I'm going to take seven years off my life
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.540]   for an Olympic gold medal.
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:11.020]   No, it requires more chaotic journey
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:13.300]   that doesn't do that kind of calculus.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:15.820]   And I just want to kind of speak to the,
[01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:19.420]   in the culture that struggles of what is healthy and not,
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.820]   we want to be able to speak to what is healthy
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:26.460]   and at the same time be inspired by the great heights
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:29.900]   that humans reach no matter how healthy
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.700]   or unhealthy they live.
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:34.140]   - Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.500]   I think if that's a flag you're hoisting,
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.380]   I will definitely salute it because it really depends,
[01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:41.660]   what are you trying to optimize for in your life?
[01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:45.500]   And if you are, I think the only danger potentially
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.900]   with that mindset is that
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.460]   if you look at many of the studies of old age
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:53.340]   and end of life,
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.220]   most people say, I never look back on my life
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:43:01.260]   and wish I worked harder.
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:06.260]   I wish instead I'd spent more time with family, friends
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:08.380]   and engaged in that aspect.
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.320]   Now I'm not saying though, coming back to your point,
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:13.820]   that that is the standard rubric for everyone.
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.860]   I don't believe it is too.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:17.660]   And there are many things that you and I
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.620]   are both benefiting from today,
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.300]   even in the field of medicine,
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:26.460]   where people have sacrificed their own longevity
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:30.180]   for the quest of solving a particular medical problem
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:36.220]   and they died quicker because of their commitment,
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:40.400]   because they wished to try and solve that problem
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.100]   in their pursuit of greatness scientifically.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:44.820]   And I now benefit.
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.580]   Am I grateful that they did that?
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.100]   Incredibly grateful.
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:51.700]   A simpler demonstration is this,
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:54.540]   if tonight at 4 a.m. in the morning,
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:59.540]   I have a ruptured appendix, I have an appendicitis,
[01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:04.580]   I am incredibly grateful that there is an emergency team
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:07.700]   that will take me to the hospital at 4 a.m. in the morning.
[01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:11.200]   They are awake, they're not sleeping and they save my life.
[01:44:12.380 --> 01:44:17.380]   And that's part of what their life's mission and quest is.
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:21.500]   And they saved another's life by, in some ways,
[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.740]   shaving a little of their own off.
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:27.980]   So I don't take, I have no umbrage
[01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:30.220]   with that mentality at all.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.780]   I think you just have to be very clear
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:34.980]   about what you're optimizing for.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:39.740]   And my worry is that most people fall into the rat race
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.180]   and they never actually ask the question,
[01:44:42.180 --> 01:44:43.620]   why am I doing this?
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:46.300]   - If you're just working nine to five,
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.700]   and you allow that nine to five to stretch into much longer,
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:54.180]   but it's nevertheless a job that's kind of like,
[01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:56.500]   wears you down, that's one thing.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:59.280]   Another thing is when it is a lot like,
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.220]   it's a dream.
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.420]   - Your life mission is to accomplish.
[01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:08.300]   And for that, I think as long as you know
[01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:11.060]   what it is that you could be doing to yourself
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.600]   and you are comfortable and A-okay with that,
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.820]   I have no problem with that at all.
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:20.220]   Again, as I said, as a scientist,
[01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:23.060]   I cannot, should not, and will not tell anyone
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.860]   what they should do with their life.
[01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:27.340]   All I want you to be able to do is say,
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:31.660]   okay, now I understand more about the,
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.820]   previously these were the known unknowns
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:38.220]   and these were the unknown unknowns.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:41.400]   And now I am slightly more cognizant,
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.400]   I have more knowns than I had before
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:48.420]   regarding my sleep and my health,
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.900]   knowing that information,
[01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:53.860]   do I still choose to make this decision?
[01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:56.960]   And if that's what I offered,
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:59.520]   then I think I've done my job.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.380]   That's all I want to offer is just added information
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.860]   into the decision algorithm
[01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:09.260]   and what you end up choosing as an output of that algorithm
[01:46:09.260 --> 01:46:11.220]   has nothing to do with me.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:14.700]   It's not my business and I will never judge anyone for it.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.260]   And as I said, I'm immensely grateful
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:19.580]   for people who have sacrificed much in their lives
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.380]   to give me what I have.
[01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:23.180]   - So you're saying as long as the sacrifice,
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:27.540]   sort of grounded in knowledge of what the sacrifice is,
[01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.020]   that sleep is important, all those kinds of things.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.260]   - And that you're comfortable with it,
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.140]   that it is your conscious choice
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:34.500]   rather than feeling as though you're trapped
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:38.020]   or that you are just, you haven't thought about it.
[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:41.260]   And you start that job at age 32
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:44.100]   and then you wake up the next morning and you're 65
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:45.620]   and you think, where did my life go?
[01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:46.940]   What was I doing?
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:49.500]   That to me, I would feel, I would want to hug you
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:52.940]   and I would say, I'm just, and I'm not sounding,
[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:56.420]   I don't mean to sound belittling here at all.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.940]   I would just not wish that for you.
[01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:03.940]   I would wish that you could have thought about
[01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.580]   what it was that you're doing and not have that regret.
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:10.060]   - Yeah, so I guess I'm, this is for you, the listener.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.020]   I'm coming out of the closet here a little bit.
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:14.660]   The fact that I enjoy the madness I live in.
[01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:17.460]   So please do not criticize me, embrace me.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:20.860]   I understand the sacrifices I'm making.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:22.580]   I enjoy sleeping on the floor
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:25.060]   when I'm passionately programming all night
[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:28.700]   and just pass out on the carpet.
[01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:30.500]   I love this life, okay?
[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.900]   So it's, but it's definitely something I think about
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:38.060]   that there's a balance to strike where--
[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.380]   - I just want you to have as much of it though.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.260]   - Of life.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:47.940]   See, quality of life is important.
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:51.020]   - I should have said, I want you to have
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:53.060]   as much high quality life.
[01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.940]   And if high quality of life means
[01:47:55.940 --> 01:48:00.420]   I spend five decades on this planet,
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:04.660]   but yet in that time, I am thrilled every day.
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:07.900]   I'm turned on every day by what I do.
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:12.900]   And I reveled in this thing called my life's work.
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.260]   I think that that is a 50 year journey
[01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:21.960]   of absolute delight and fulfillment that you should take.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.740]   - I think about my death all the time.
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.000]   I meditate on death.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.900]   I'm okay to die today.
[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:36.580]   So to me, longevity is not a significant goal.
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.140]   I'm so happy to be alive.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:43.620]   I don't even think it would suck to die today.
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:47.500]   I'm as afraid of it today as I will be in 50 years.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.940]   I don't wanna die as much today as I will in 50 years.
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:55.060]   There's of course all these experiences
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:59.900]   I would like to have, but everything's already amazing.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.020]   It's like that Lego movie.
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.900]   So I don't know.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.540]   So to me, I just wanna keep doing this.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:11.540]   And there's of course things that could affect,
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.880]   like you mentioned dementia and these deterioration
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.140]   of the mind or the body that can significantly affect
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:23.580]   the quality of life.
[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:24.420]   And so you want to-
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.260]   - As long as you're aware of that.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.540]   And that's the price you pay for the entry
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:32.900]   of into this magical kingdom that you are experiencing,
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.340]   which is a lovely thing.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:37.060]   I feel privileged too.
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.940]   I can't believe the life that I live.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.620]   It's incredible.
[01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:46.620]   And just like you, I think about mortality a great deal.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:51.140]   I think a lot about death, but I don't worry about death.
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:56.060]   I probably, with the exception of the potential pain
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:58.420]   that comes before it, that some people,
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:02.140]   many people can suffer, that maybe concerns me.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:06.640]   But I actually think about mortality as a tool,
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.640]   as I use it as a lens through which I can then retrospect.
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.940]   And by placing myself at the point of future mortality,
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:21.580]   I can then use it as a retrospective lens to focus
[01:50:21.580 --> 01:50:23.460]   and ask the following question,
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.920]   is there anything I feel I would regret
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.620]   and therefore change in the life that I currently have now?
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:36.220]   That's the way I meditate and use mortality as a question,
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:39.580]   is to try and course correct and focus my life.
[01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.740]   I worry not about dying,
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.980]   but I like to think about death
[01:50:44.980 --> 01:50:48.260]   as a way to prioritize my life, if that makes sense.
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.540]   I don't know if that makes sense.
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:52.740]   - No, it makes total sense to decide
[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:57.740]   how do you want to live today so that in the future,
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:51:00.100]   you do not regret the way you've lived today.
[01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:02.340]   - Right, and to place yourself in the future
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:06.220]   at your point of mortality is one way to, I think,
[01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:10.460]   as an exercise to retrospectively look back
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:13.020]   and not lose out on informed choices
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:15.420]   that you could otherwise lose out on
[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.060]   if you weren't thinking about mortality.
[01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:21.020]   - Yeah, it clarifies your thinking.
[01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.900]   Is there, so I mentioned I sleep on the floor,
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:28.620]   take naps and power naps, and it's just kind of madness.
[01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:31.860]   Is there weirdnesses to your own sleep schedule
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:35.300]   as a scientist that does incredible work,
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:37.100]   has a lot of things going on,
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:41.820]   has to lead research, has to write research,
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:44.580]   has to be a science communicator,
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:46.780]   also have a social life, all those kinds of things.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:49.940]   Is there certain patterns to your own sleep
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:54.940]   that you regret or you participate in
[01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.420]   that you find you enjoy?
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:03.140]   Is there some personal stuff, quirks,
[01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:05.020]   or things you're proud of that you do
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:07.340]   in terms of your sleep schedule?
[01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:10.620]   - The funny thing about being a sleep researcher
[01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:13.020]   is that it doesn't make you immune
[01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:16.300]   to the ravages of a difficult night of sleep,
[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:21.300]   and I have battled my own periods of insomnia in my life too.
[01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:26.900]   And I think I've been fortunate in ways
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:28.460]   because I know how sleep works
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:30.300]   and I know how to combat insomnia.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.660]   I know how to get it under control
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:36.940]   because insomnia in many ways is a condition
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:40.500]   where all of a sudden your sleep controls you
[01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:42.500]   rather than you control your sleep.
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.460]   - Wow, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it, yeah.
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:51.460]   - And I know when I'm starting to lose control
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:54.860]   and it's starting to take control,
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.860]   I understand how to regain,
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:01.420]   but it doesn't happen overnight.
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.620]   It takes a long time.
[01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:06.780]   - So you've struggled with insomnia in your life?
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:08.340]   - I have, not all of my life.
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:09.740]   I would say I've probably had three
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:12.420]   or four really severe bouts,
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:14.860]   and all of them usually triggered
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:17.740]   by emotional circumstances, by stress.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:22.180]   - Stress that's connected to actual events in life
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:24.380]   or stress that's unexplainable?
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:27.260]   - Well, externally triggered, yeah.
[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:30.020]   It's sort of what we would call reactive stress.
[01:53:30.020 --> 01:53:36.460]   And so that's sort of point number one
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:38.620]   about the idiosyncrasies.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.180]   The point number two is that when you are having
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:45.020]   a difficult night of sleep, as a sleep researcher,
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:47.820]   you basically have become the Woody Allen neurotic
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:48.860]   of the sleep world.
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.020]   Because at that moment, I'm trying to fall asleep
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.020]   and I'm not, and I'm starting to think,
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.940]   okay, my dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is not shutting down,
[01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:59.860]   my noradrenaline is not ramping down,
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.180]   my sympathetic nervous system
[01:54:01.180 --> 01:54:02.940]   is not giving way to my parasympathetic.
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:05.380]   At that point, you are dead in the water
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:08.140]   for the next two hours and nothing is bringing you back.
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:11.460]   So there is some irony in that too.
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.460]   I would say for myself though,
[01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.940]   if there is something I'm not proud of,
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:21.940]   it has been at times railing against my chronotype.
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:25.540]   So your chronotype is essentially,
[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:27.380]   are you a morning type, evening type,
[01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:28.580]   or somewhere in between?
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:29.420]   - Yeah.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:32.580]   - And there were times because society
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:37.100]   is desperately biased towards the morning types.
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.540]   This notion of the early bird catches the worm.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.660]   Maybe that's true, but I'll also tell you
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:44.540]   that the second mouse gets the cheese.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:47.060]   - Yeah.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.540]   - So I think one of the issues--
[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.500]   - That's a good line.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:55.300]   - Around, firstly, people don't really understand chronotype
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:56.580]   because I'll have some people
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:58.100]   when I'm sort of out in the public,
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:00.180]   they'll say, look, I struggle with terrible insomnia
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:02.380]   and I'll ask them, is it problems falling asleep
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.220]   or staying asleep?
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:05.140]   And they'll say falling asleep.
[01:55:05.140 --> 01:55:07.900]   And then I'll say, look, if you are on a desert island
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:11.660]   with nothing to wake up for, no responsibilities,
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.140]   what time would you normally go to bed
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:14.300]   and what time would you wake up?
[01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:15.820]   And they would say, I'd probably like to go to bed
[01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:18.660]   about midnight and wake up maybe eight in the morning.
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:20.900]   And then I'd say, so what time do you now go to bed?
[01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:22.940]   And they'd say, well, I've got to be up for work early,
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:25.340]   so I get into bed at 10.
[01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:26.780]   I'd say, well, you don't have insomnia,
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:29.860]   you have a mismatch between your biological chronotype
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:31.780]   and your current sleep schedule.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:33.620]   And when you align those two,
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:35.900]   and I was fighting that for some time too,
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:40.780]   I'm probably mostly right in the middle.
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:43.700]   I am desperately vanilla, unfortunately,
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:47.060]   in many aspects of life, but this included,
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:48.420]   I'm neither a strong morning type
[01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.940]   nor a strong evening type.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:53.500]   So ideally, I'd probably like to go to bed around 11,
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.900]   10.30, 11, probably somewhere between 10.30 and 11
[01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:00.220]   and wake up, I naturally wake up usually most days
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.340]   before my alarm at 7.04.
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:08.540]   And it's 7.04 because why not be idiosyncratic
[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:09.380]   in terms of setting an alarm?
[01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.980]   - I love it.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.180]   - And so I--
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:15.060]   - That's kind of awesome, I've never heard about that.
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:17.300]   That's amazing, I'm gonna start doing that now,
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:19.380]   setting alarms like a little bit off the--
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:20.340]   (laughing)
[01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:22.380]   - Yeah, I'm never quite sure why we all--
[01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.780]   - It's a celebration of uniqueness.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:28.820]   - Yeah, and I am quite the odd snowflake in that sense too.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:31.500]   So I would usually then try to force myself
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.940]   because I had that same mentality that if I wasn't up
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:39.060]   at 6.30 and in the gym by seven,
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:41.820]   that there was something wrong with me.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:44.540]   And I quickly abandoned that.
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:46.620]   But if I look back, if there was a shameful act
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:49.180]   that I have around my sleep, I think it would be that
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.860]   for some years until I really started
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:53.140]   to get more detailed into sleep.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:56.620]   And now I have no shame in telling people
[01:56:56.620 --> 01:57:01.620]   that I will probably usually wake up around 6.45 naturally,
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:06.100]   sometimes seven, when people are looking at me thinking,
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.940]   you're a sloth, you're lazy.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:13.780]   And I don't finish my daily workout until,
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:17.860]   I'm not working until probably nine o'clock in the morning.
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:19.500]   They're thinking, what are you doing?
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.940]   Now I will work late into the day.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:25.500]   If I could, I would work 16 hours.
[01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.300]   It's my passion just like yours.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.980]   So I don't feel shame around that,
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:34.460]   but I have changed my mentality around that.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:40.540]   - It's complicated because I'm probably happiest
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:45.940]   going to bed, if I'm being honest, like at 5 a.m.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:48.180]   - That's fine, you're just an extreme evening type.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:53.180]   - But the problem is, it's not that I'm ashamed for it.
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:56.540]   I actually kind of enjoy it 'cause I get to sleep
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:59.660]   through all the nonsense of the morning.
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:01.180]   - Isn't that a beautiful thing?
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:03.260]   - Like people are busy with their emails
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:06.340]   and I just am happy as a cow.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:09.540]   And I wake up, after all the drama has been resolved.
[01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:12.260]   - Yeah, and cows are happy and the drama has been resolved.
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:15.580]   - Exactly, but in society you do,
[01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:18.080]   especially, I mean, this is what I think about is,
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:22.340]   when you work on a larger team, especially with companies,
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:26.780]   you are, everybody's awake at the same time.
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:31.100]   So that's definitely been a struggle to try to figure out,
[01:58:31.100 --> 01:58:34.140]   just like you said, how to balance that,
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.540]   how to fit into society and yet be optimal
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.580]   for your chronotype.
[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:42.980]   - Yeah, you have to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony.
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:47.540]   Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology,
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.940]   you'll normally lose.
[01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:50.620]   And the way you know you've lost is
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.020]   through disease and sickness.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:56.540]   - You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia.
[01:58:56.540 --> 01:59:02.460]   Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype,
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.900]   is there advice you can give how to overcome insomnia
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:07.780]   from your own experience?
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.660]   - Right now, the best method that we have
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.780]   is something called cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:15.020]   for insomnia or CBTI for short.
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:18.720]   And you work with, for people who don't know what it is,
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:21.380]   you work with a therapist for maybe six weeks
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:22.740]   and you can do it online, by the way,
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:25.820]   I recommend probably jumping online, it's just the easiest.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:31.100]   And it will change your beliefs, your habits,
[01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.060]   your behaviors and your general stress
[01:59:33.060 --> 01:59:34.780]   around this thing called sleep.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:36.700]   And it is just as effective as sleeping pills
[01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.060]   in the short term.
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.500]   But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills,
[01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.100]   when you stop working with your therapist,
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.780]   those benefits last for years later.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:47.300]   Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills,
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:49.460]   you typically have what's called rebound insomnia
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.820]   where your sleep not only goes back
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.340]   to being as bad as it was before, it's usually even worse.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:59.580]   For me, I think I found a number of things effective.
[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:02.580]   The first is that I had to really address
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:07.580]   what was stressful and try to come up with some degree
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:11.580]   of meaningful rationality around it.
[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:13.620]   Because I think one of the things that happens,
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:15.860]   there's something very, talking about conscious states
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:19.540]   to come all the way back to, gosh, I don't know,
[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:21.740]   I feel like we've only been chatting for like 20 minutes,
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:23.340]   but you're gonna tell me it's been a while.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:24.380]   - Yeah, it's been a while.
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:27.980]   - Okay, I'm desperately, I feel terribly sorry.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:29.500]   But let's come back to conscious states
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.320]   which is where we started.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.380]   There is something very strange about the night
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:41.300]   that thoughts and anxieties are not the same
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:43.380]   as they are in the waking day.
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:45.780]   They are worse, they are bigger.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:50.300]   And I at least find that I am far more likely
[02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:58.140]   to catastrophize and ruminate at night about things
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:01.340]   that when I wake up the next day in the broad light of day,
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:03.980]   I think it's no one near that bad man.
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:04.900]   What were you doing?
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:06.900]   It's not that bad at all.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:10.420]   So to gain firstly, some rational understanding
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:14.260]   of my emotional state that's causing that insomnia
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:15.660]   was very helpful.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:18.900]   The second thing was to keep regularity,
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:21.260]   just going to bed at the same time waking up.
[02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:25.340]   And here's an unconventional piece of sleep advice.
[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:30.340]   After a bad night of sleep, do nothing.
[02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:36.800]   Don't wake up any later, don't go to bed any earlier,
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:40.980]   don't nap during the day, and don't drink any more coffee
[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.480]   than you would otherwise.
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:47.120]   Because if you end up sleeping later into the morning,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.440]   you're then not going to be tired
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:51.040]   at your normal time at night.
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.200]   So then you're gonna get into bed thinking,
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:55.040]   well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night.
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.780]   And yes, I slept in this morning to try and compensate,
[02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:00.900]   but I'm still gonna get to bed at my normal time.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:03.600]   But now you get into bed and you haven't been awake
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.360]   for as long as you normally would.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.640]   So you're not as sleepy as you normally would be.
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:10.240]   And so now you sit there lying in bed
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:12.120]   and it's another bad night.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:15.960]   And the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier,
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:20.040]   so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time,
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:21.560]   don't go to bed any earlier,
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.800]   because then you're just probably, your chronotype,
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:26.560]   your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.960]   And you think, well, terrible night,
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:31.040]   I'm gonna get into bed at 9 p.m.
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.560]   rather than my standard 10.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.260]   You're just gonna be lying in bed awake for that hour.
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.320]   Naps will take our double-edged sword.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.640]   They can have wonderful benefits.
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.440]   And we've done lots of studies on naps
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:42.240]   for both the brain and the body,
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.560]   but they are a double-edged sword in the sense that
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.080]   napping will just take the edge off your sleepiness.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:52.240]   It's a little bit like a valve on a pressure cooker.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.280]   When you nap during the day,
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.840]   you can take some of that healthy sleepiness
[02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:59.120]   that you've been building up during the day.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.900]   And for some people, not all people,
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.820]   but for some people, that can then make it harder
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:04.200]   for them to fall asleep at night
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.320]   and then stay asleep soundly across the night.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:08.440]   So the advice would be,
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.240]   if you're struggling with sleep at night,
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.080]   don't nap during the day.
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.560]   But if you are not struggling with sleep
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.680]   and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.200]   And we can play around with optimal durations
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:21.600]   depending on what you want.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:23.720]   Just try not to nap too late into the day
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.240]   because napping late into the day
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:27.380]   is like snacking before your main meal.
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:30.360]   It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger, as it were.
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.360]   But that would be,
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.320]   so that's my unconventional second piece of advice
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.160]   regarding insomnia.
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:39.020]   The third is meditation.
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:41.280]   I found meditation to be incredibly powerful.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.940]   I started reading about meditation
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:48.940]   as I was researching that aspect of the book many years ago.
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:51.060]   And as a hard-nosed scientist,
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:53.720]   I thought this sounds very woo-woo.
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:57.360]   This is sort of, we all hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"
[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.420]   and everything's going to be fine with sleep.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:02.680]   I read the data and it was compelling.
[02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:04.280]   I couldn't ignore it.
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.040]   And I started meditating.
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:09.640]   And that was six years ago and I haven't stopped.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.280]   And I find meditation before bed incredibly powerful.
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.160]   The meditation app companies
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.500]   were perplexed at this at first.
[02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:19.440]   They want people to meditate during the day.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:21.700]   But when they looked at their usage statistics,
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:23.500]   they found that they would have people
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:24.960]   in the morning meditating.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.900]   And then there's a huge number of people
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.940]   using the meditation app in the evening.
[02:04:28.940 --> 02:04:32.300]   What they were doing was self-medicating their insomnia.
[02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.960]   And they finally, rather than railing against it,
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:39.720]   they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.840]   So I found meditation to be helpful.
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:43.400]   Having a wind down routine
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.840]   is the other thing that's critical for me.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.200]   I can't just go from, because when my mind is switched on,
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.560]   and I think you may be like this too,
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:55.720]   if I get into bed, that rolodex of thoughts
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:00.000]   and information and excitement and anxiety and worry
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.680]   is just whirling away.
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:05.320]   And it's not gonna be a good night for me.
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.640]   So I have to find a wind down routine.
[02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:10.640]   And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:12.360]   Sleep is not like a light switch.
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:17.320]   Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:20.600]   It takes time to descend down onto the terra firma
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.360]   that we call sound sleep at night.
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.240]   And we have this for kids.
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.540]   I don't have children, but a lot of parents will say,
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:35.120]   we have to have the bedroom, sorry, the bedtime routine.
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:37.560]   You bathe the kid, you put them in bed,
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:38.880]   you read them a story.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.560]   You have to go through this routine,
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.400]   this wind down routine for them.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.520]   And then they fall asleep wonderfully.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.800]   Why do we abandon that as adults?
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:51.440]   We need that same wind down routine.
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.240]   So that's been the other thing
[02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.680]   that's been very helpful to me.
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:57.200]   So don't do anything different.
[02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:01.000]   If you have a bad night of sleep, keep doing the same thing.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.120]   Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it.
[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:07.520]   Then meditation.
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:09.600]   And then finally having some kind
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:12.020]   of disengagement wind down routine.
[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:15.640]   Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me.
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:16.480]   - That's brilliant.
[02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:20.600]   So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia.
[02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:28.800]   Is it possible to have a healthy sleep life
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.460]   without the regularities?
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:34.820]   - I say that because I'm all over the place
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:37.220]   and I've gotten good at being all over the place.
[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:40.780]   So I'll often, like what happens,
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:42.140]   I'll go stretches of time.
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:46.260]   There'll be some times a month where my days are like,
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:49.180]   this is embarrassing to admit, but they're like-
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.140]   - It's just you and I here.
[02:06:51.140 --> 02:06:51.980]   Just you and I.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:54.420]   - It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days.
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:59.980]   I'll just go all the way around comfortably and happily.
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:00.820]   I love it.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.420]   And then there'll be a nap.
[02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:05.340]   I mean, if you add up the hours,
[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:09.020]   when I'm just sleeping as much as I want,
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:12.500]   it'll probably be like six hour average per 24 hours.
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:16.700]   So it works out nicely.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.460]   Maybe even seven hours, I don't know.
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:21.500]   But it's obviously irregular
[02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.100]   and there's chaos in the whole thing.
[02:07:24.100 --> 02:07:26.740]   So sometimes it's shorter sleep, sometimes it's longer.
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:31.260]   Is that totally not a good thing, do you think?
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:34.100]   - The best evidence that we have to speak to this question
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:36.380]   is people who are doing rotating shifts.
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:42.100]   And unfortunately, the news is not good.
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:45.820]   They usually have a higher instance of many diseases
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:50.820]   such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:55.100]   obesity, stroke, and
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.260]   (silence)
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:08:04.100]   And again, that's just me communicating the data
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:06.540]   that we have and I'm not telling you
[02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:08.820]   that you should do anything different.
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:13.260]   The other thing is that there's nothing in your biology
[02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:16.540]   that suggests that that's how your body was designed
[02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:17.380]   to sleep.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:22.140]   It is a system that loves habit.
[02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.940]   If your circadian clock in your brain,
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:30.900]   it's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,
[02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:33.900]   sits in the middle of your brain, had a personality trait,
[02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:36.540]   it would be a creature of habit.
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.420]   It loves habit.
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:42.180]   That's how your biology is designed to work
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:47.180]   is through very archetypal, prototypical, expected cycles.
[02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:52.540]   And when we do something different to that,
[02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:55.860]   then you start to see some of the pressure,
[02:08:55.860 --> 02:08:58.820]   stress, fractures in the system.
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:01.580]   But again, to your point,
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:04.100]   if that's something that you don't mind,
[02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:07.100]   adopting and understanding,
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:12.340]   then I think you should keep doing what you're doing.
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:13.580]   - It's complicated.
[02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:15.380]   Of course, you have to be a student of your own body
[02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.260]   and explore it.
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:18.500]   One of the reasons I wanna have kids
[02:09:19.980 --> 02:09:22.580]   is kids enforce a stricter schedule.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:23.620]   (laughing)
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:25.060]   I think I definitely--
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:26.460]   - So I've heard.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:31.460]   - I definitely feel that I'm not living the sort of data-wise,
[02:09:31.460 --> 02:09:35.060]   scientifically speaking, the optimal life.
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:38.060]   And me just living the way I wanna live day-to-day
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:40.140]   is perhaps not the optimal way.
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:42.020]   And there's certain things that I've seen,
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:45.740]   very successful people that I know in my life,
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:48.540]   when they have kids,
[02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.500]   they actually, their productivity goes up,
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:51.700]   they get their shit together.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.100]   There's a lot of aspects that--
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:54.300]   - Regularity, yeah.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:55.460]   - Yeah, the regularity.
[02:09:55.460 --> 02:09:56.900]   I mean, that creatures a habit.
[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:58.940]   That's the thing, that's power.
[02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:01.580]   And then you start to optimally use the hours
[02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:02.780]   you have in the day.
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:03.620]   Let me ask you about--
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:06.820]   - Well, actually, I just have one quick point on that too.
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:11.820]   We often think about sleep as a cost,
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:17.300]   but instead I think of sleep as an investment.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.700]   And the reason is because your effectiveness
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:23.140]   and your efficiency when you're well-slept
[02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:27.060]   typically exceeds that when you're not.
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:28.700]   And to me, it's the idea of,
[02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:31.460]   if I'm going to boil a pot of water,
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:35.380]   why would I boil it on medium
[02:10:35.380 --> 02:10:37.900]   when I could boil it in half the time on high?
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:40.380]   - Yeah.
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:43.620]   - And I sometimes worry that when I speak
[02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:45.180]   to Fortune 500 companies,
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:49.580]   and they're of this mentality of long hours,
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:51.700]   getting people to rise and grind.
[02:10:51.700 --> 02:10:56.180]   The first point is that after about 20 hours of being awake,
[02:10:56.180 --> 02:10:58.740]   a human being is as cognitively as impaired
[02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:01.700]   as they would be if they were legally drunk.
[02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.980]   And the reason I bring that point up
[02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.980]   is because I don't know any company or CEO who would say,
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:12.380]   I've got this great team, they're drunk all the time.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:16.340]   But we often lord the airport warrior
[02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:19.340]   who's flown through three different time zones
[02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.980]   in the past two days is on email at 2 a.m.
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:24.740]   and then is in the office at six.
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:28.980]   And I think there is some aspect, not in all people,
[02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:30.380]   but there is sort of some aspect
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.060]   of that slight sleep machismo.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:36.940]   And that's not what, you are very different.
[02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:40.460]   You are driven by a purity of passion
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:44.180]   and a very authentic, incredibly genuine goal
[02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:48.180]   of wanting to do something remarkable with your life.
[02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:51.620]   That's not the issue I think I'm speaking about.
[02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:55.660]   It's just simply that I think the,
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:02.900]   this notion of wanting to be awake for longer
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:06.820]   to try and get more done can sometimes be at odds
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:11.260]   with the fact that you can actually get so much more done
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:12.620]   if you're well slept.
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:14.460]   And it's this trade off.
[02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:17.660]   - I actually admire people that take the big risk
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:20.260]   and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night,
[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:21.900]   all those kinds of things,
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:25.020]   but it cannot be in the framework, in the context,
[02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:26.140]   like what Edison said,
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:28.740]   which is sleep feels like a waste of time.
[02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:32.620]   So like, if you're not sleeping
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:36.540]   because you think sleep is stupid, that's totally wrong.
[02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:37.820]   But if you're not sleeping
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:39.860]   because you're deeply passionate about something,
[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:43.420]   that to me, it's a gray area, of course,
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:45.260]   but that to me is much more admirable.
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:48.300]   And everything you're espousing is saying like,
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:49.660]   whatever the hell you're doing,
[02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:51.700]   you better be aware that sleep,
[02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:54.700]   long-term and short-term is really good for you.
[02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:57.260]   So if you're not sleeping, you're sacrificing,
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:00.100]   just make sure you're sacrificing for the right thing.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:04.060]   I see vodka and getting drunk the same way.
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:05.540]   I know it's not good for me.
[02:13:05.540 --> 02:13:08.500]   I know I'm not gonna feel good days after.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:10.620]   I know it's gonna decrease my performance.
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.820]   There's nothing positive about it,
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:17.540]   except it introduces chaos in my life
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:20.340]   that introduces beautiful experiences
[02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:22.140]   that I would not otherwise have.
[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:27.140]   It creates like this turmoil of social interaction
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.820]   that ultimately makes me happy
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:31.940]   that I've experienced them in the moment.
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:34.620]   And later the stories, you get to meet new people.
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:36.620]   So like alcohol in this society
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:40.380]   is an incredible facilitator of that.
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:44.020]   So like, that's a good example of like not sleeping
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:46.420]   and drinking way too much vodka.
[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:49.580]   - Again, it's this notion of life is to be lived
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:54.460]   to a degree, but if you do have children,
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:56.780]   I think one of the other things
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:58.660]   that then maybe comes into the picture
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:03.380]   is the fact that now there are other people
[02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:06.740]   that you have to live for than yourself.
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:10.740]   - Yeah, but come on, like once they're old enough,
[02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:13.580]   like if you can't defend for yourself,
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:15.620]   you're too weak, get stronger.
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:17.740]   - It's gonna be that kind of fatherhood.
[02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:18.580]   I got it.
[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:22.580]   I'm understanding so much more about like screaming
[02:14:22.580 --> 02:14:23.780]   than I did before.
[02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:25.260]   - That's why you have to have,
[02:14:25.260 --> 02:14:29.500]   for me that'd be, my wife would be probably softer.
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:30.620]   It's good cop, bad cop.
[02:14:30.620 --> 02:14:31.700]   'Cause I think I'm...
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:35.540]   But of course, actually, 'cause I don't have kids,
[02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:39.740]   I've seen some tough dudes when they have kids
[02:14:39.740 --> 02:14:44.340]   become like the softies.
[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:47.260]   They become like, they do everything for their kids.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:50.660]   It becomes like, it totally transforms their life.
[02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:53.180]   I mean, Joe Rogan is an example of that.
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:57.380]   I've just seen so many tough guys completely become changed
[02:14:57.380 --> 02:15:00.420]   by having kids, which is fascinating to watch
[02:15:00.420 --> 02:15:03.500]   'cause it just shows you how meaningful having kids is
[02:15:03.500 --> 02:15:04.380]   for a lot of people.
[02:15:04.380 --> 02:15:06.180]   - Although I would say having,
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:11.340]   chatted with Joe for some time,
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:13.740]   I think he is a delightful sweetheart,
[02:15:13.740 --> 02:15:15.020]   independent of children.
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:17.220]   I think, don't get me wrong,
[02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:19.740]   I don't wanna be in a ring with him.
[02:15:19.740 --> 02:15:22.260]   He would face me five ways till Tuesday,
[02:15:22.260 --> 02:15:24.780]   but I think he's a desperately sweet man
[02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:26.740]   and a very, very smart individual.
[02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:29.460]   - Yeah, I mean, but he talks about the compassion
[02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:32.980]   he's gained from realizing, just watching kids grow up,
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:35.100]   that we were all kids at some point.
[02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.140]   You get a new perspective.
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.460]   I think just like me, I still get this with him.
[02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:41.820]   He's super competitive
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:45.420]   and there's a certain way to approach life.
[02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:47.740]   Like you're striving to do great things
[02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:49.740]   and you're competitive against others
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:52.260]   and that intensity or that aggression,
[02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:56.660]   that can lack compassion sometimes and empathy.
[02:15:56.660 --> 02:15:59.020]   And when you have children, you get a sense like,
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:00.940]   oh, everybody was a child at some point.
[02:16:00.940 --> 02:16:02.420]   Everybody was a kid.
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:04.780]   And you see that whole development process.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.300]   It can definitely enrich,
[02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:12.300]   expand your ability to be empathetic.
[02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:15.020]   Let me ask about diet.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:19.580]   So what's the connection between diet and sleep?
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:21.220]   So I do intermittent fasting,
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:24.740]   sometimes only one meal a day, sometimes no meals a day.
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:26.700]   Is there a good science on the interaction
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:29.860]   between fasting and sleep?
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:31.500]   - We have some data.
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:33.060]   I would prefer more,
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:36.980]   but we have data both on time-restricted eating
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:43.620]   and then we have some data on fasting to a degree.
[02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:47.860]   On time-restricted eating,
[02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:51.340]   I think that it has some benefits,
[02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:53.060]   although the human replication studies
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:56.660]   have actually not borne out quite the same health benefit
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:16:59.060]   to the extent that the animal studies have.
[02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:01.820]   There've been some disappointing studies,
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:05.820]   one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently.
[02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:09.940]   So I think time-restricted eating can be a good thing.
[02:17:09.940 --> 02:17:13.140]   And there are many benefits of time-restricted eating.
[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:14.260]   Is sleep one of them?
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:15.940]   No, it doesn't seem to be
[02:17:15.940 --> 02:17:17.780]   because there are probably at the time
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:18.740]   that we're recording this,
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:21.580]   three pretty decent studies that I'm aware of.
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:25.740]   Two out of the three were in obese individuals.
[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:29.340]   One out of the three were in healthy weight individuals.
[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:31.580]   And what they found was that time-restricted eating
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:33.500]   in all three of those studies
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:36.380]   didn't have any advantageous benefit to sleep.
[02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:38.700]   It didn't necessarily harm sleep,
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:41.820]   but it didn't seem to improve it.
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.220]   When it comes to fasting though,
[02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.980]   which is a different state,
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:47.500]   we don't have too many studies,
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:49.500]   experimental studies with long-term fasting.
[02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:50.780]   The best data that we have
[02:17:50.780 --> 02:17:53.020]   is probably from religious practices.
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:56.980]   And probably the most data we have is during Ramadan
[02:17:56.980 --> 02:18:01.100]   where people will fast for 29 to 30 days
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:03.140]   from sunrise to sunset.
[02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:07.220]   And under those conditions,
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:12.220]   there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:16.260]   None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep.
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:18.420]   The first is that the amount of melatonin
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:20.740]   that you release, and melatonin is a hormone.
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:23.420]   It's often called the hormone of darkness
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.300]   or the vampire hormone,
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:27.100]   not because it makes you look longingly
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:28.300]   at people's necklines,
[02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:31.260]   but it's just because it comes out at night.
[02:18:31.260 --> 02:18:33.820]   Melatonin signals to your brain and your body
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:37.180]   that it's dark, it's nighttime, and it's time to sleep.
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:39.300]   Those individuals, when they were undergoing
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:40.780]   that regimen to fasting,
[02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:44.700]   the amount of melatonin that was released
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:46.020]   and when it was released,
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:48.220]   the amount of melatonin decreased
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:51.060]   and when it was released came later.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:52.260]   That was the first thing.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:55.460]   The second thing was that they ended up
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.820]   finding it harder to fall asleep
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:00.580]   as quickly as they normally would otherwise.
[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.780]   The third thing was that the total amount of sleep
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:05.260]   that they were getting decreased.
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:07.460]   The fourth fascinating thing was that
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:12.260]   a wake-promoting chemical called orexin increased.
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:14.020]   And this is why a lot of people will say,
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.100]   when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer.
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:21.700]   And I'm more alert, I'm more active.
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:24.020]   And I'll come back to, from an evolutionary perspective,
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:26.660]   why we understand that to be the case.
[02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:28.460]   And then the fourth factor is that
[02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.580]   fasting didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:33.300]   that seemed to be unaffected.
[02:19:33.300 --> 02:19:36.340]   It did, however, decrease the amount of REM sleep
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:37.460]   or dream sleep.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:39.500]   And we know that REM sleep dreaming is essential
[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:42.460]   for emotional first aid, mental health,
[02:19:42.460 --> 02:19:45.340]   it's critical for memory, creativity.
[02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:47.460]   It's also critical for several hormone functions.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.700]   It's when, you know, if you,
[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:52.220]   there's direct correlations between testosterone,
[02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:54.380]   you know, testosterone release peaks
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:58.100]   just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too.
[02:19:58.100 --> 02:20:00.260]   So REM sleep is critical.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:02.820]   But, so those are the five changes that we've seen.
[02:20:02.820 --> 02:20:06.140]   None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep.
[02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.540]   But the fourth point that I mentioned, which was orexin,
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:12.340]   which is this wake-promoting chemical,
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:15.300]   and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration
[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:18.940]   of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain
[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:21.820]   and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy,
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:25.540]   where, you know, you're just unpredictable
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:28.080]   with your sleep and you, so,
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:33.140]   so orexin when it's in high concentrations
[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:35.140]   keeps you awake when you lose it,
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:37.820]   it can, you know, it can put you very much
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:40.100]   into a state of narcolepsy where you're sleeping
[02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:43.460]   a lot of the time in unpredictable sleep.
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:46.580]   Why on earth, when you are fasting,
[02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:51.580]   would the brain release a wake-promoting chemical?
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:54.620]   And our answer is right now is the following.
[02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:56.940]   The, one of the few times that I mentioned before
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:00.580]   that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep
[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:03.660]   or prolonged sleep deprivation
[02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:05.660]   is under conditions of starvation.
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:11.020]   And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure.
[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:14.020]   And at that point, the brain will forego some,
[02:21:14.020 --> 02:21:18.460]   it won't forego all, but it will forego some of its sleep.
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:21.240]   And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer
[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:24.460]   because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain,
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:27.900]   you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter,
[02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:29.500]   you need to stay awake for longer
[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:31.700]   so you can travel outside of your perimeter
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:33.980]   for a further distance,
[02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:37.300]   and maybe you will find food and save the organism.
[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.660]   So in other words, when we fast,
[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:43.620]   it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal
[02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:46.380]   that you are under conditions of starvation.
[02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:49.020]   So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness,
[02:21:49.020 --> 02:21:50.300]   I need to release the chemical
[02:21:50.300 --> 02:21:52.900]   that helps the organism stay awake for longer,
[02:21:52.900 --> 02:21:57.420]   which is a rexin, so that they can forage for more food.
[02:21:57.420 --> 02:21:59.940]   Now, of course, your brain from evolutionary perspective
[02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:02.340]   doesn't know about this thing called Safeway
[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:05.780]   that you could easily go to and break the fast.
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:08.300]   But that's how we understand fasting.
[02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:11.140]   And I think, my dear friend, Peter Atiyah
[02:22:11.140 --> 02:22:14.060]   has done a lot of work in this area too.
[02:22:14.060 --> 02:22:17.340]   I think fasting and David Sinclair's brilliant work,
[02:22:17.340 --> 02:22:20.140]   goodness me, what an individual too.
[02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:21.900]   The work is pretty clear there
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:25.100]   that time-restricted eating and fasting
[02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:28.540]   have wonderful health benefits.
[02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:32.700]   Fasting creates this thing called hermesis,
[02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:37.460]   just like exercise and low-level stress and sauna,
[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:41.580]   heat, shock, and hermesis is a biological process,
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:43.700]   I think, as David Sinclair has once said,
[02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:45.500]   in simple layman's terms is,
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:47.540]   what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:53.340]   And I think there is certainly good data
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:56.260]   that fasting and time-restricted eating has many benefits.
[02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:57.780]   Is sleep one of them?
[02:22:57.780 --> 02:23:00.700]   It doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to enhance sleep.
[02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:04.500]   - But it's interesting to understand its effects on sleep.
[02:23:04.780 --> 02:23:09.100]   I've, like, I've fasted,
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:12.460]   it's a study of NF2,
[02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:16.900]   I've once fasted 72 hours and another time, 48 hours.
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:20.380]   And I found that I got much less sleep
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:22.660]   and was very restful though.
[02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:24.780]   I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt,
[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:27.020]   which is I needed less sleep.
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.900]   I wonder if my brain is deceiving me
[02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:31.100]   because it feels like I'm getting
[02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:34.620]   a whole extra amount of focus for free.
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:39.740]   And I wonder if there's long-term impacts of that.
[02:23:39.740 --> 02:23:41.780]   Because if I fast 24 hours,
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:45.940]   get the same amount of calories, one meal a day,
[02:23:45.940 --> 02:23:47.340]   there's a little bit of discomfort,
[02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:50.580]   like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder,
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:54.620]   maybe there's just, I mean, hunger,
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:58.780]   but the amount of focus is crazy.
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:00.700]   And so I wonder, it's like,
[02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:02.140]   I'm a little suspicious of that.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:04.340]   I feel like I'm getting something for free.
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:07.820]   I'm the same way with sweetener, like Splendor or something.
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:10.380]   It's like, it's gotta be really bad for you, right?
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:12.820]   'Cause why is it so tasty, right?
[02:24:12.820 --> 02:24:17.820]   - And I think, yeah, as we said before, with biology,
[02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:20.580]   you don't get, if there's a gain,
[02:24:20.580 --> 02:24:23.460]   there's, yeah, there's often a cost too.
[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:28.420]   So, but we at least understand the biological basis
[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.260]   of what you're describing.
[02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:33.100]   It's not that you actually don't need less sleep.
[02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:36.300]   It's that this chemical is present
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:39.220]   that forces you more awake.
[02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:42.020]   And so subjectively you feel as though,
[02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:45.220]   I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake.
[02:24:45.220 --> 02:24:47.860]   And those two things are quite different.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:51.780]   It's not as though your sleep need has decreased.
[02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:54.300]   It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch,
[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:57.540]   the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:59.660]   because food is in short supply.
[02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:03.380]   - So you mentioned during sleep, there's assimilation,
[02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:05.420]   all those kinds of things for learning purposes,
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:08.180]   but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways
[02:25:08.180 --> 02:25:11.340]   in which we become psychotic in dreams.
[02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:14.460]   What do you think dreams are about?
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:17.780]   Why do you think we dream?
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:21.100]   What place do we go to when we dream?
[02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:22.380]   And why are they useful?
[02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:25.820]   Not just the assimilation aspect,
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:29.460]   but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams.
[02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:33.340]   Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?
[02:25:33.340 --> 02:25:38.340]   Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:43.260]   - So one of the camps in the sleep field
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:46.420]   is that dreams are meaningless,
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:49.580]   that they are an epiphenomenal by-product
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:51.420]   of this thing called REM sleep
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.420]   from which dreams come from as a physiological state.
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:26:00.340]   So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb,
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:02.900]   that the reason that you create the apparatus
[02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:06.340]   of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:08.700]   in the same way that we've evolved
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:10.340]   to this thing called REM sleep
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:13.740]   to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves.
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:17.100]   But it turns out that when you create light in that way,
[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:19.860]   you also produce something called heat.
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:22.820]   It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb,
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:26.180]   it's just what happens when you create light in that way.
[02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:29.180]   And the belief so too was that dreaming
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:32.140]   was essentially the heat of the light bulb.
[02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:34.860]   That REM sleep is critical,
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:38.380]   but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours,
[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:42.180]   you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon
[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:43.660]   called dreaming.
[02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:46.280]   I don't believe that for a second.
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:47.860]   (laughs)
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:50.740]   And from a simple perspective is that I suspect
[02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:54.460]   that dreaming is more metabolically costly
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.860]   as a conscious experience than not dreaming.
[02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:58.640]   So you could still have REM sleep,
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:01.900]   but absent the conscious experience of dreaming
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:05.580]   was probably less metabolically costly.
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:10.420]   And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit called ATP,
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:12.340]   which is the most valuable thing,
[02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.260]   there's usually a reason for it.
[02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:20.260]   So if it's more energetically demanding,
[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:23.020]   then I suspect that there is a function to it.
[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:26.620]   And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function.
[02:27:26.620 --> 02:27:29.180]   The first, as we mentioned, creativity.
[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:32.340]   The second is that dreams provide a form
[02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:35.140]   of overnight therapy.
[02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:38.860]   Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid.
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:40.580]   And it's during dream sleep at night
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:43.900]   that we take these difficult, painful experiences
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:47.000]   that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic,
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.360]   and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:53.480]   And it sort of just takes the sharp edges
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:56.340]   off those difficult, painful experiences
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:58.640]   so that you come back the next day
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:01.560]   and you feel better about them.
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.000]   And so I think in that sense, dreaming,
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.320]   it's not time that heals all wounds.
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:09.380]   It's time during dream sleep
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:11.780]   that provides emotional convalescence.
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:15.720]   So dreaming is almost a form of, you know,
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:17.720]   emotional windscreen wipers.
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:19.900]   (both laughing)
[02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:24.900]   And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream,
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:30.060]   it's what you dream about that also matters.
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:32.100]   So for example, scientists have done studies
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:33.060]   with learning and memory
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:36.080]   where they have people learn a virtual maze.
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.500]   And what they discovered was that those people
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:45.220]   who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze,
[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:47.840]   were the only ones who, when they woke up,
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:50.760]   ended up being better at navigating the maze.
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:53.400]   Whereas those people who dreamed,
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:55.860]   but didn't dream about the maze itself,
[02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.980]   they were no better at navigating the maze.
[02:28:57.980 --> 02:28:59.900]   So it's not just that you, it's not,
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:02.420]   it's sort of necessary, but not sufficient.
[02:29:02.420 --> 02:29:04.300]   It's necessary that you dream,
[02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.820]   but it's not sufficient to produce the benefit.
[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:09.900]   You have to be dreaming about certain things itself.
[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:13.340]   And the same is true for mental health.
[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.420]   What we've discovered is that people who are going through
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:18.100]   a very difficult experience, a trauma, for example,
[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:23.060]   a very painful divorce, those people who are dreaming,
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:26.360]   but dreaming of that difficult event itself,
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.580]   they go on to gain resolution
[02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:31.140]   to their clinical depression one year later.
[02:29:31.140 --> 02:29:34.620]   Whereas people who were dreaming just as much,
[02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:37.380]   but not dreaming about the trauma itself,
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:40.740]   did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution
[02:29:40.740 --> 02:29:42.340]   to their depression.
[02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:46.940]   So it's, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence
[02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:50.340]   that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal.
[02:29:50.340 --> 02:29:53.900]   And it's not just about the act of dreaming.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.220]   It's about the content of the dreams,
[02:29:57.220 --> 02:30:00.500]   not just the fact of a dream itself.
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:01.820]   - It's, first of all, it's fascinating.
[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:02.980]   It makes a lot of sense,
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:05.660]   but then immediately takes my mind to,
[02:30:05.660 --> 02:30:07.180]   from an engineering perspective,
[02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:10.480]   how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems.
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:16.860]   If you think about dreaming as an important part
[02:30:16.860 --> 02:30:19.100]   about learning and cognition
[02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:23.580]   and filtering previous memories of what's important,
[02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:27.100]   integrating them, maybe you can correct me,
[02:30:27.100 --> 02:30:31.480]   but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:34.620]   that are not constrained by physics.
[02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:37.860]   So you get a chance to take some of your memories,
[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:40.340]   some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties,
[02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:42.380]   and play with them,
[02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:46.380]   construct virtual worlds and see how it evolves,
[02:30:46.380 --> 02:30:48.900]   to play with those worlds
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:51.100]   in a safe environment of your mind,
[02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:53.020]   safe in quotes, 'cause you could probably get
[02:30:53.020 --> 02:30:56.980]   into a lot of trouble with the places your mind will go.
[02:30:56.980 --> 02:31:01.980]   But this definitely is applied in much cruder ways
[02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:05.860]   in artificial intelligence.
[02:31:05.860 --> 02:31:08.740]   So one context in which this is applied
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:12.780]   is the process called self-play,
[02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.420]   which is reinforcement learning,
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:19.420]   where agents play against itself or versions of itself.
[02:31:19.420 --> 02:31:23.380]   And it's all simulated of trying different versions
[02:31:23.380 --> 02:31:25.300]   of themselves and playing against each other
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:29.100]   to see what ends up being a good.
[02:31:29.100 --> 02:31:32.620]   The ultimate goal is to learn a function
[02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:33.900]   that represents what is good
[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:35.900]   and what is not good in terms of how you should act
[02:31:35.900 --> 02:31:37.100]   in the world. - Right, you create a set
[02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:39.460]   of decision weights based on experience,
[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:41.500]   and you constantly update those weights
[02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:43.060]   based on ongoing learning.
[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.980]   - But the experience is artificially created
[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:48.620]   versus actual real data. - That's right.
[02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:51.620]   - So it's a crude approximation of what dreams are,
[02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:54.420]   which is you're hallucinating a lot of things
[02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.460]   to see which things are actually--
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.300]   - No, I think it's been a theory that's been put forward,
[02:31:59.300 --> 02:32:04.300]   which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space
[02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:06.700]   that is largely consequence-free.
[02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:11.140]   What an incredible gift to give a conscious mind
[02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:12.260]   each and every night.
[02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:15.900]   - Now, the conscious mind, the human mind,
[02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:17.780]   is very good at constructing dreams
[02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:20.660]   that are nevertheless useful for you.
[02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:22.540]   Like, they're wild and crazy,
[02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:27.420]   but they're such that they are still grounded in reality
[02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:29.940]   to a degree where anything you learn in dreams
[02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:32.100]   might be useful in reality.
[02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:34.380]   This is a very difficult thing to do
[02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:36.540]   'cause it requires a lot of intelligence,
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:38.000]   it requires consciousness.
[02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:41.700]   This has been effectively recently been used
[02:32:41.700 --> 02:32:45.980]   in self-supervised learning for computer vision
[02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:50.060]   with the process of what's called data augmentation.
[02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:53.260]   That's a very crude version of dreams,
[02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:55.500]   which is you take data and you mess with it
[02:32:56.700 --> 02:33:01.220]   and you start to learn how a picture of a cat
[02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:06.980]   truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways.
[02:33:06.980 --> 02:33:09.060]   Now, the crude methods currently are cropping,
[02:33:09.060 --> 02:33:11.500]   rotating, distorting, all that kind of stuff,
[02:33:11.500 --> 02:33:14.100]   but you can imagine much more complicated
[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:18.180]   generative processes that start hallucinating
[02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:21.460]   different cats in order for you to understand deeply
[02:33:21.460 --> 02:33:25.020]   of what it means for something to look like a cat.
[02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:27.660]   - What is the prototype of a archetype of a cat?
[02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:28.940]   - Yeah, the archetype.
[02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:31.540]   That's a very difficult process for computer vision
[02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:36.060]   to go from what are the pixels
[02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:38.500]   that are usually associated with a cat
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:42.860]   to what is a cat in the visual space?
[02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:44.740]   In the three-dimensional visual space
[02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:46.500]   that is projected on an image,
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:50.260]   on a two-dimensional image, what is a cat?
[02:33:50.260 --> 02:33:52.860]   Those are fundamentally philosophical questions
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:56.500]   that we humans don't know the answer to,
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.060]   like linguistically, but when we look at a picture
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:03.180]   of a cat and a dog, we can usually tell pretty damn well
[02:34:03.180 --> 02:34:04.300]   what's the difference.
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:05.900]   And I don't know what that is
[02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:08.380]   because you can't reduce that to pointy ears
[02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:11.500]   or non-pointy ears, furry or not furry,
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:12.340]   something about the eyes.
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:14.860]   - It's been a longstanding issue in cognitive neuroscience,
[02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:16.660]   cognitive neuroscience too,
[02:34:16.660 --> 02:34:20.220]   is how does the brain create an archetype?
[02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:22.340]   How does it create schemas
[02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:24.980]   that have general applicability
[02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:29.740]   but yet still obtain specificity?
[02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:31.700]   That's a very difficult challenge.
[02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:32.700]   I mean, we can do it.
[02:34:32.700 --> 02:34:33.540]   We do it.
[02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:35.660]   It's rather bloody amazing.
[02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:37.740]   - It seems like part of the toolbox
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:41.140]   is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams.
[02:34:41.140 --> 02:34:45.860]   - Well, it's a relaxing of the rigid constraints.
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.780]   I often think of dreaming as,
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:52.740]   it's from an information processing standpoint,
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:54.700]   the prison guards are away
[02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:59.060]   and the prisoners are running amok in a delightful way.
[02:34:59.060 --> 02:35:00.260]   And part of the reason is because
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:01.940]   when you go into dream sleep,
[02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:03.660]   the rational part of your brain
[02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:05.940]   called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part,
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:07.700]   it's like the CEO of the brain.
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:09.580]   It's very good at making high level, rational,
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:12.580]   top-down decisions and controlled actions.
[02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:17.340]   That part of the brain is shut down during REM sleep.
[02:35:17.340 --> 02:35:20.660]   But then emotional centers, memory centers,
[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:24.220]   visual centers, motoric centers,
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:27.260]   all of those centers actually become more active.
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:29.580]   In fact, some of them are more active
[02:35:29.580 --> 02:35:32.900]   than when we're awake in the dream state.
[02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:33.740]   - That's fascinating.
[02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:37.340]   - So your brain from a neural architecture perspective
[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:39.580]   is radically different.
[02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:44.540]   Its network feature is not the same as wakefulness.
[02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:48.140]   And I think this is an immensely beneficial thing
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:51.780]   that we have at least two different rational
[02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:54.300]   and irrational conscious states
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:56.460]   that we do information processing in.
[02:35:56.460 --> 02:35:58.220]   The rational, the veritical,
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:01.460]   the page one of the Google search is wakefulness.
[02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:06.020]   The more irrational, illogical, hyper-associative,
[02:36:06.020 --> 02:36:08.700]   Google page 20 is the REM sleep.
[02:36:08.700 --> 02:36:11.980]   Both I think are critical, both are necessary.
[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:12.860]   - That's fascinating.
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:15.660]   And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:18.700]   in the machines to help them learn better
[02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:21.660]   and to reason better.
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:23.580]   - And in some ways,
[02:36:23.580 --> 02:36:25.900]   we also know it from a chemical perspective too.
[02:36:25.900 --> 02:36:27.820]   When you go into dream sleep,
[02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:31.900]   it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other that we see
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:34.900]   in the rest of the 24-hour state.
[02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:37.700]   There is a chemical called noradrenaline
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:40.380]   or norepinephrine in the brain.
[02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:42.620]   And you know if it's sister chemical in the body
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:45.700]   called adrenaline, but upstairs in the brain,
[02:36:45.700 --> 02:36:48.220]   noradrenaline is very good at creating
[02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:52.260]   a very hyper-focused, attentive, narrow,
[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:57.260]   it's sort of very convergent way of thinking
[02:36:57.260 --> 02:37:01.220]   to a point, sharp, focus, that's the only thing.
[02:37:01.220 --> 02:37:04.140]   The spotlight of consciousness is very narrow.
[02:37:04.140 --> 02:37:05.860]   That's noradrenaline.
[02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:08.820]   When you remove noradrenaline,
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:13.820]   then you go from a high SNR, high signal to noise ratio,
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:16.900]   where it's just you and I in this moment.
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:18.940]   I don't even know what's going on elsewhere.
[02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:21.700]   I am with you, noradrenaline is present.
[02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:24.940]   But when you go into REM sleep,
[02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.220]   it is the only time during the 24-hour period
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:30.060]   where your brain is devoid of any noradrenaline.
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:31.740]   It is completely shut off.
[02:37:31.740 --> 02:37:34.940]   And so the signal to noise ratio is very different.
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:36.660]   It's almost as though we're injecting
[02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:40.220]   a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture
[02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:42.460]   of the brain during dream sleep,
[02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:45.780]   as if it's chemically brute-forced
[02:37:45.780 --> 02:37:50.780]   into this relaxed associative memory processing state.
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:53.180]   And then from an anatomical perspective,
[02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:56.220]   just as I described, the prefrontal cortex goes down
[02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:58.620]   and other regions light up.
[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:01.700]   So it is a state that seems to be very,
[02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:06.460]   I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep
[02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:08.820]   and tell me that it's not REM sleep,
[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:10.660]   just say, "Look, based on the pattern
[02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:12.540]   of this brain activity, what would you say
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:14.460]   is going on in this person's mind?"
[02:38:14.460 --> 02:38:16.500]   I would say, "Well, they're probably not rational.
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:18.140]   They're probably not having logical thought
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:19.940]   because their prefrontal cortex is down.
[02:38:19.940 --> 02:38:21.460]   They're probably feeling very emotional
[02:38:21.460 --> 02:38:23.580]   because their amygdala is active,
[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:25.420]   which is an emotional center of the brain.
[02:38:25.420 --> 02:38:27.340]   They're definitely going to be thinking visually
[02:38:27.340 --> 02:38:30.620]   'cause the back of the brain is lit up, the visual cortex.
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:33.900]   It's probably going to be filled with past experience
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:35.940]   and autobiographical memories
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:39.540]   because their memory centers are lighting up.
[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:40.860]   And there's probably going to be movement
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:43.060]   because their motor cortex is very active."
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:45.980]   That to me sounds very much like a dream.
[02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:48.060]   And that's exactly what we see in brain scanners
[02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:50.420]   when we've put people inside of them.
[02:38:50.420 --> 02:38:54.340]   - One of the things I notice sleep affects
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:59.340]   is my ability to see the beauty in the world.
[02:38:59.340 --> 02:39:00.460]   - Yeah.
[02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:03.740]   - So what do you think is the connection
[02:39:03.740 --> 02:39:06.020]   between sleep and your emotional life?
[02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:10.620]   Your ability to love other human beings and love life?
[02:39:10.620 --> 02:39:15.460]   - Yeah.
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:19.780]   I think it's very powerful and strong.
[02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:22.860]   So we've done a lot of work in the field of sleep
[02:39:22.860 --> 02:39:25.020]   and emotion and sleep and moods.
[02:39:25.020 --> 02:39:29.780]   And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets,
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:31.980]   you know, positive and negative.
[02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:35.380]   And what's interesting is that when you are sleep deprived
[02:39:35.380 --> 02:39:38.980]   and the more hours that you go into being awake
[02:39:38.980 --> 02:39:41.220]   and the fewer hours that you've had to sleep,
[02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:47.220]   your negative mood starts to increase.
[02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:52.220]   And we know which individual types of emotions are changing.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:55.060]   I've got a wonderful postdoc in my lab
[02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:58.020]   called Etty Ben-Simon, who's doing some incredible work
[02:39:58.020 --> 02:40:01.140]   on trying to understand the emotional,
[02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:06.140]   individual emotional tapestry of affective meltdown
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:12.060]   when you're not getting sufficient sleep.
[02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:14.180]   But let's just keep with two dimensions,
[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:15.140]   positive and negative.
[02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:15.980]   - Yes.
[02:40:15.980 --> 02:40:17.620]   - The negative, most people would think,
[02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:19.660]   well, it's the negative that takes the biggest hit
[02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:20.780]   when I'm sleep deprived.
[02:40:20.780 --> 02:40:22.340]   It's not.
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.060]   By probably a log order magnitude larger
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:29.020]   is a hit on your positive emotions.
[02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.380]   In other words, you stop gaining pleasure
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:35.180]   from normally pleasurable things.
[02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:38.420]   And it's a state that we call anhedonia.
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:43.420]   And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression.
[02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:46.420]   So depression to most people's surprise
[02:40:46.420 --> 02:40:50.100]   isn't necessarily that you're always feeling
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:52.060]   negative emotions.
[02:40:52.060 --> 02:40:55.580]   It's often more about the fact that you lose
[02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:58.700]   the pleasure in the good things in life.
[02:40:58.700 --> 02:41:00.620]   That's what we call anhedonia.
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:03.740]   That's what we see in sleep and insufficient sleep.
[02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.540]   And it happens quite quickly.
[02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:07.180]   - Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.
[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:10.660]   I think I do, it's not depression,
[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:15.180]   but like it's a stroll into that direction,
[02:41:15.180 --> 02:41:17.340]   which is when I'm sleep deprived,
[02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:20.400]   I stop being able to see the meaning in life.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.980]   The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning.
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:28.380]   Like stupid, it makes me realize how enjoyable
[02:41:28.380 --> 02:41:29.940]   everything is in my life.
[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:31.420]   Because when I start to lose it,
[02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:33.620]   when I'm severely sleep deprived,
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:36.060]   you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it.
[02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:38.740]   But that said, I'm just cognizant enough
[02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:40.780]   that like sleep fixes all of that.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:44.140]   So I use those states for what they're worth.
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:48.020]   In fact, I personally like to pay attention
[02:41:48.020 --> 02:41:52.780]   to the things that bother me in doing that time.
[02:41:52.780 --> 02:41:56.800]   'Cause they also reveal important information to me.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.500]   - That's an interesting method to use like a Rorschach.
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:04.260]   - Yeah, I mean, there's, so I find this
[02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:06.900]   when I fast combine with sleep deprivation,
[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:10.700]   am clear to see with people,
[02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:12.940]   clear in identifying the things
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:15.740]   that are not going right in my life,
[02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:18.540]   or people that I'm working with
[02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:21.240]   are not doing as good of a job as they could be doing.
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:25.940]   Like people that are negative in my life,
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:28.180]   I'm more able to identify them.
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:30.020]   So I don't act on that.
[02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:32.340]   It's a very bad time to act on those decisions.
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:36.860]   But I'm like recording that information
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:40.060]   because I usually when I'm well rested and happy,
[02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:42.060]   I see the beauty in everybody,
[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:44.020]   which can get you into trouble.
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.020]   So you have to balance those two things.
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:47.340]   But yes, it's fascinating.
[02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:48.740]   - But there's irony there too,
[02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:51.380]   which is the fact that when you're well rested
[02:42:51.380 --> 02:42:53.020]   and well slept, as you said,
[02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:56.820]   you see the beauty in life and it sort of enlivens you
[02:42:56.820 --> 02:43:01.580]   and sort of gives you a quality of life
[02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:03.760]   that's emotionally very different.
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:09.900]   Yet then we are contrasting that against the need
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:15.580]   for not getting enough sleep
[02:43:15.580 --> 02:43:17.620]   because of the beautiful things
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:19.980]   that you want to accomplish in life.
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:23.820]   And I don't actually see them as,
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:30.340]   sort of completely counterintuitive or paradoxical
[02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:32.740]   because I still think that you can strive
[02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:35.580]   for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for
[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:38.020]   to have the monumental goals,
[02:43:38.020 --> 02:43:42.160]   the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve.
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.140]   They can still enthrall you and excite you
[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:48.020]   and stimulate you.
[02:43:48.020 --> 02:43:52.060]   But because of the insufficient sleep that they can
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:55.420]   or that goal can produce,
[02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:59.980]   it will shave off the beauty of life
[02:43:59.980 --> 02:44:01.300]   that you experience in between.
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:04.100]   And again, this is just about the trade-off.
[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:05.220]   I will say though that,
[02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:09.080]   and this is not applicable to your circumstance,
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:14.380]   we do know that insufficient sleep
[02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:18.740]   is very strongly linked to suicide ideation,
[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:22.880]   suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well.
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:28.260]   And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep,
[02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:29.820]   we have not been able to discover
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:32.900]   a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:37.380]   And I think that that is a profound state.
[02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:41.860]   I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep
[02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:45.100]   as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions.
[02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:47.620]   I also think it's a potential sign
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:50.020]   that we should be using sleep as a tool
[02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:52.260]   for the prevention of grave mental illness.
[02:44:52.260 --> 02:44:54.900]   - Yeah, it's both a cause and a solution.
[02:44:54.900 --> 02:44:57.060]   So, I mean, me personally,
[02:44:57.060 --> 02:45:01.340]   I've gone through a few dark periods quite recently
[02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:06.240]   and it was almost always sleep is not the cause,
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:10.820]   but sleep is the catalyst from going to a bad time
[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:12.380]   to a very bad time.
[02:45:12.380 --> 02:45:13.220]   - Yeah.
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:15.100]   - And so it's definitely true.
[02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:18.580]   And it's funny how sleep can just cure all of that.
[02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:20.100]   - There's actually a beautiful quote
[02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:24.380]   by an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman,
[02:45:24.380 --> 02:45:26.100]   who once said that the best bridge
[02:45:26.100 --> 02:45:29.640]   between despair and hope is a good night's sleep.
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:35.820]   And I spilled so much ink and hundreds of pages
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:40.140]   inelegantly trying to say the same thing in my book.
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:43.860]   And he said it in one line and it's beautiful.
[02:45:43.860 --> 02:45:45.420]   - What do you think is,
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:47.500]   we've been talking about how to extend this life,
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.960]   how to make it a good life.
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:53.460]   We've been talking about love.
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:55.860]   What do you think is the meaning of this whole ride?
[02:45:55.860 --> 02:45:56.700]   - Of life?
[02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:57.520]   - Of life.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.820]   Why do we want to make it a good one?
[02:46:00.820 --> 02:46:01.860]   Do you think there's a meaning?
[02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:03.860]   Do you think there's a answer to the why?
[02:46:03.860 --> 02:46:06.860]   - For me personally,
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:14.220]   I think the meaning of life is to eat,
[02:46:14.220 --> 02:46:17.940]   is to sleep, is to fall in love,
[02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:23.740]   is to cry, and then to die.
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:29.580]   Oh, and probably race cars in between.
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:30.540]   - Race cars.
[02:46:30.540 --> 02:46:33.380]   Well, there's a whole topic of sex we didn't talk about,
[02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:34.900]   so that's probably in there somewhere.
[02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:36.660]   - Should we do that?
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:38.940]   - Maybe if you'll have me back, I would love to do it.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:39.780]   I will go around.
[02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:42.820]   - Next time we will do another three hours on sex alone.
[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:43.660]   - Yeah.
[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:47.260]   - It has been over three hours, yes.
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:48.100]   - Okay.
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:50.340]   - Matt, I'm a big fan of your work.
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:51.980]   I think you're doing really important work,
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:54.260]   even despite all the things I've been saying
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:56.620]   about the madness of my own sleep schedule.
[02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:58.700]   I think you're helping millions of people.
[02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:02.280]   So it's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:05.780]   And I can't wait until your podcast comes out.
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:06.860]   I'm a huge fan of podcasts.
[02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:08.260]   I'm a huge fan of you.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:10.820]   And it's just an honor to know you
[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:12.500]   and to get a chance, hopefully in the future,
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:13.740]   to work together with you.
[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:17.340]   - You're a brilliant man and you're doing amazing things.
[02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:22.220]   And I feel immensely honored to have met you,
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:25.900]   to now know you, and to start calling you a friend.
[02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:27.660]   Thank you for what you do for the world
[02:47:27.660 --> 02:47:31.140]   and for me included.
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:33.140]   - Thank you, Matt.
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:34.660]   - Take care.
[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:36.100]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:37.100]   with Matt Walker.
[02:47:37.100 --> 02:47:40.740]   And thank you to stamps.com, Squarespace,
[02:47:40.740 --> 02:47:43.580]   Athletic Greens, BetterHelp, and Onnit.
[02:47:43.580 --> 02:47:46.980]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:50.540]   And now let me leave you with some words from Nikola Tesla,
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:52.300]   who we discussed in this podcast
[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:54.100]   as sleeping very few hours a night.
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:57.540]   "All that was great in the past was ridiculed,
[02:47:57.540 --> 02:48:00.100]   "condemned, combated, and suppressed,
[02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:02.700]   "only to emerge all the more powerfully,
[02:48:02.700 --> 02:48:06.380]   "all the more triumphantly from the struggle."
[02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:09.300]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:48:09.300 --> 02:48:11.900]   (upbeat music)
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:14.500]   (upbeat music)
