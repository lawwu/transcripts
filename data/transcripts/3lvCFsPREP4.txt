[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:15.080]   the Gospel according to St. John. In the first chapter, reading verses 26 and 33, verses
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.000]   26 and 33, in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John, John answered them
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   saying, "I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and I knew
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   him not, but he that sent me to baptize with water. The same said unto me, Upon whom thou
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.600]   shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.480]   the Holy Ghost." And the subject we are dealing with, as most of you remember, is this great
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   matter of the baptism with the Holy Ghost. This, I am trying to show, is what enables
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:10.800]   us as Christian people to represent our blessed Lord and Saviour and God our everlasting Father
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.740]   in this world of sin and of time and of shame. And this we are concerned about because we
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.380]   believe that this is the supreme need of the world this morning, the supreme need of every
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.160]   individual, the only hope for the world at large. We are living in a world which is full
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   of trouble, full of confusion, full of sin and of shame, a world which has been trying
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.800]   to deal with and to solve its own problems throughout the centuries, but which is no
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.000]   nearer to solving them than it was at the beginning, a world which we believe, according
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.720]   to the teaching of this book, is under the wrath of God, a world which has turned away
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:08.200]   from God and brought down calamity and trouble upon itself. Its only hope is in this gospel.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.760]   And Christians are people who are called of God, not only out of that world into his kingdom,
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.380]   but are meant to be his representatives. Endless statements to that effect can be found everywhere
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.720]   in the Bible. The children of Israel, the Jews, were God's people. They were given
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.400]   the oracles of God. God gave the revelation to them in order that he might represent,
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.880]   they might represent him before the nations of the world. And that is true of the Christian.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.800]   It is the business of the Church to tell the world, as it is, of this great and glorious
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.880]   salvation which is in Christ Jesus. He is the only hope of the world. There is no hope
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:03.160]   in men. The only hope is in the Son of God. And our business is to represent him, to glorify
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.600]   him amongst the people of the world, to magnify his name, to show them the excellences of
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.000]   his person and of his great salvation. That's our business. We alone do that in this world.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Nobody else does that but the Christian Church. This is the unique business of the Christian
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.400]   Church, to preach Christ and him crucified as the only hope, the only savior of the world,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.480]   to declare that there is none other name under him given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   Christian people alone have that message, and they alone can present it to the world.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.080]   The world doesn't know it. It doesn't believe it. That's the cause of its trouble. So we
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.800]   are called uniquely to bear witness to him, to magnify him. But the question is, how can
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:02.400]   we do that? We are aware of the facts concerning him, but he himself has taught that that's
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.600]   not sufficient. He tells even these trained apostles, disciples of his who have been with
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.360]   him throughout his earthly ministry and have seen his death and burial, were witnesses
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.880]   of his resurrection with their naked eyes. He tells them, "Tarry ye in Jerusalem until
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.560]   ye be endued with power from on high." And on the day of Pentecost he sent that power
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.200]   upon them in a baptism of the Holy Spirit. And so we are trying to show that the central,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.520]   main object of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to enable us with power to be witnesses
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.120]   unto him, his person, his work. And therefore there is nothing more important at the present
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.640]   hour than that we should understand this teaching, hence the time we are giving to it.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.280]   Now we've come to the point at which we are considering what are the evidences of this
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.040]   baptism with the Spirit, and I've divided them into two main categories, those which
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.240]   are more or less internal and subjective, known mainly to the men or women, himself
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.200]   or herself, and those which are more objective in their character. And obviously these objective
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.000]   ones are of great importance, of vital importance, in this whole matter of witness and of testimony.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.080]   So we are dealing with them at the moment, and I have suggested some such things as this,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.880]   that one of the objective results of the baptism with the Spirit is at times seen even in a
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:46.320]   person's facial appearance, a kind of transfiguration, some reflection of the glory of God, as the
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.400]   face of Moses shined when he came down from the mountain, having been with God. So there
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.380]   is something of this in the Christian. We all, says Paul, in 2 Corinthians 3, 18, we
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:07.360]   all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:15.280]   same image, from glory to glory, even by the Lord the Spirit. Well, we've dealt with
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.280]   that.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.520]   And then we've come to this point when we are dealing with it as it shows itself in
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   speech, and the great first characteristic here is the power and the ability that is
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.680]   given, not only in preaching, but in ordinary conversation, and in prayer. There are still
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.080]   people I find who seem to think that what we are talking about is only for certain special
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.520]   people. I try every Sunday morning to point out that that is a complete fallacy, that
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.360]   the New Testament offers this to all, and indicates clearly that this is possible to
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.760]   all. I hope that that is now clear once and forever. This is not only for certain special
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.560]   people. There is no such teaching here. The promise is to you and to your children and
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:09.640]   to as many as are far off. And not only that, I have tried as best I can to give you illustrations
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:19.940]   which show that ordinary unknown people can know this glorious experience even as outstanding
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.720]   and distinguished people can. I ended last Sunday morning by reporting to you something
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.480]   within my own experience in the case of one of the most ordinary men I have ever known.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.000]   Pray my dear friends that the Holy Spirit will give you power to concentrate and to
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.520]   listen. I went out of my way to end last Sunday morning with this ordinary man, yet I heard
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:47.560]   a letter from somebody who said, "Is this only for certain special people?" Pray that
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.360]   you may be given grace to listen. The devil would rob us of the most glorious aspects
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:02.200]   of the Christian faith. Let us therefore concentrate with all our powers, lest he rob us of something
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:07.840]   that God is offering to us. Very well. Having dealt in that way with this power that comes
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:14.160]   in speech in all forms and in prayer, I would go on to emphasize something else which is
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.240]   obvious and that is the note of authority. Now this of course was the thing that struck
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   people about our blessed Lord himself, though he was a carpenter and though he was as judged
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.600]   by the world a mere nobody. Yet when he begins to speak, they are struck at once by the way
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.220]   in which his teaching differs from that of the Pharisees and Scribes. They said this
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:46.120]   man speaketh and teacheth with authority, not as the Pharisees and Scribes. And that
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:52.600]   was the great characteristic of his ministry. But do not forget, he was not able, even he,
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.360]   the Son of God incarnate was not able to commence his ministry until he had been baptized with
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:05.800]   the Spirit at his baptism with water in the Jordan by John the Baptist. That is why John
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.840]   puts it here. John had been told, "He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   unto me, upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him, he, the
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.240]   same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost." And you remember when our Lord went back after
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:30.400]   that to his hometown of Nazareth and went into the synagogue on the Sunday and was given
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.440]   the book to read and he began to speak. The passage which he read was that famous passage
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:43.120]   from Isaiah, the book of Isaiah, which reads like this, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.400]   me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." Well, the anointing
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.200]   took place when the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove in the baptism in
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   Jordan at the hands of John the Baptist. And from that moment this authority came out.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.240]   And it was evident to all. Well, now this again is something that was equally clear
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.920]   and evident in the apostles after their baptism with the Spirit. The contrast in the case
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:16.280]   of Peter is so striking. You read his sermon on the day of Pentecost as recorded in the
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.760]   second chapter of the book of Acts and you are struck by the authority with which he
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.360]   spoke and commanded the congregation and expounded the scriptures, no hesitation, no fumbling.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.720]   The men who were the other disciples, you remember, couldn't even believe the report
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.160]   about the resurrection. You read the last chapter of Luke's gospel and you will find
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.440]   that when the women who had gone early to the tomb came back and reported to these very
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.560]   disciples and apostles the fact that they had found the grave to be empty. We are told
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:57.520]   their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not. And they were muddled
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.920]   in their whole understanding of the Old Testament scriptures. But here is a man speaking, expounding
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.600]   the scriptures with authority. This is always one of the results of the baptism with the
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.840]   Spirit. And you get exactly the same thing in the case of the Apostle Paul. There are
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.120]   such endless examples of this that one scarcely knows where to quote and where not to quote.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.800]   Let me give you one example concerning the Apostle Paul in the thirteenth chapter of
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles. We find this happening in Cyprus. Paul began to preach
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:41.240]   and the chief men of the island were listening to him. But he had another man with him called
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.080]   Elymas the Sorcerer. Sergius Paulus, the prudent men, the governor, was very ready to listen.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.520]   But Elymas the Sorcerer withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith. Then
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.960]   Saul, who also is called Paul, was filled with the Holy Ghost. Now that was something
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.280]   that happened at that moment to him. It does not mean that he was always filled with the
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.120]   Holy Ghost. He was given special authority and power. You will find that being repeated
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.200]   right through the book of the Acts of the Apostles. We are told of the disciples and
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   others that they were filled with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost. Then you remember
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.240]   how in chapter four, when they had been on trial and were straightly charged not to preach
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.720]   nor to teach any more in the name of Jesus, threatened with extermination, they go back
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:34.280]   and they pray to God and God again sends the Spirit upon them. They are filled again. And
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.920]   Paul here was given a special filling, another baptism if you like, of power and authority.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.460]   So you read this. Then Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Ghost, set his
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:50.120]   eyes on him and said, "O full of all subtlety and all mischief, thou child of the devil,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.320]   thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.400]   Lord? And lo, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.520]   seeing the sun for a season." And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.600]   he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand. Now there, you see, is the authority.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.480]   There is no hesitation. The Apostle knew. And all these men always knew. They had this
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:23.040]   authority in speech. They had this authority in performing miracles. It's always a characteristic.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.920]   And as you read again the subsequent history of the Church, you will find that this is
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:35.400]   the thing that always characterizes these people, this authority. You get it in every
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.760]   revival. You get it in great reformations. What was it that enabled Martin Luther to
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.320]   stand alone, alone against fifteen centuries of tradition, with all the authorities against
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:54.360]   him, to stand alone and say, "Here I stand. I can do no other, so help me God." That's
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:00.100]   the authority. And it's characterized, I say, all men always who have received the
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.920]   baptism of the Spirit. And this authority is not only, I say again, in public declaration.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.720]   The same authority is evident about people who know these things. They've got this
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.400]   assurance and it always leads to this authority. The last thing I mention under this heading
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:23.760]   is, of course, boldness and fearlessness. And this is very striking. Again, seen perhaps
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:32.240]   most perfectly of all in the instance of the Apostle Peter himself. Peter was, of course,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.560]   by nature a very bold and impulsive man, at least impulsive if not bold. He was, he had
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.640]   a kind of boldness, but he was a good deal of a braggart, as natural boldness often leads
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.720]   to. But there he was. And yet you remember when our Lord was taken captive and set on
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.480]   trial, and the serving maid recognized Peter and said, "You were one of them. You were
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.040]   with this Galilean." Peter, you remember, denied him. He denied him three times. Why?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.480]   Well, he was afraid. He was a coward. He was trying to save his own skin. He didn't want
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:16.760]   to be put to death. So he denies his Lord, whom he'd heard and whom he'd seen performing
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.760]   these mighty miracles. He denies him in order to save his own life. And yet the moment he's
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   baptized with the Spirit, you see him, as I say, standing up and addressing that crowd
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.160]   at Jerusalem with fearlessness, boldness, charging them with sin, bringing the message
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   on to them, afraid of no one and of nothing. What a contrast. And you remember how, when
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   he was himself on trial, the thing he was so afraid of before the baptism of the Spirit,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:54.760]   then he was himself on trial. You read it at the beginning of the book of the Acts of
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:00.320]   the Apostles. We are told that the authorities laid hands on Peter and John and put them
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:06.760]   in hold unto the next day. And here they are on trial. And we read in verse 8, "Then Peter,
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   filled with the Holy Ghost." Now that was another enduement. That was something special.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   The Spirit came upon him again with unusual power. "Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:26.720]   said unto them, You rulers of the people and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.640]   of the good deed done to the impotent men by what means he is made whole, be it known
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.920]   unto you all and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:45.680]   whom ye crucify, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:53.960]   before you whole." Boldness, fearlessness. Who are these authorities? This is what the
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.240]   baptism of the Holy Ghost does to a man. And you get the same thing later on in the same
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   chapter. "When again they commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.680]   of Jesus. But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:17.160]   sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:25.260]   the things which we have seen and heard." Now this is obviously one of the great characteristics
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.880]   of the baptism of the Spirit. It gives this boldness and fearlessness. Let me give you
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.600]   one other example, because, my dear friends, if you are not thrilled by this kind of thing,
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.560]   and if you don't feel that there's something wrong with you, that you know nothing about
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.720]   this quality, well then I say we are almost beyond hope. Listen again. "Then Peter and
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.320]   the other apostles answered and said," and then before the court again, "We ought to
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:58.200]   obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:03.440]   a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour, for to
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.760]   give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.000]   things. And so is the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him." Well,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   there it is in the Scripture. And in the long annals of the Christian church, is there anything
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.480]   comparable to the way in which the saints of God have been given this same boldness
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.680]   and fearlessness. We know of some of the great notable examples. "And for myself, these
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:38.280]   are the things in which I glory. These hearers of the Christian faith, defying kings, emperors,
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:45.800]   princes, the great ones of the world, and speaking the truth of God and the truth concerning
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:53.640]   the Lord Jesus Christ." Oh, think of those early martyrs and confessors. Think of those
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.240]   men who were not afraid of a nearer. They would not be subjugated and subdued. They
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:05.000]   defied him and were ready to be cast to the lions in the arena, praising God that at last
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.840]   they had been accounted worthy to suffer for his namesake. And down the ages they come,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:19.120]   these glorious men, standing up, fighting, defying the lion's gory mane and every principality
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:26.400]   and power. All honor to the hearers of God's kingdom, these imperishable names.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:37.760]   But let's not forget this. Amongst them were large numbers of ordinary, common people.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:46.760]   As Gray puts it in The Great Elegy, "some unknown Hamden, some village Hamden, some
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:54.440]   unknown Milton." Nobody knows their names, but there have been ordinary men and women
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.520]   who have had to do this very thing, who have been threatened with losing their work, turned
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.560]   out of their homes where they and their ancestors had lived in a cottage for centuries, turned
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.360]   out for one reason only, that they had become Puritans or Methodists or something like that,
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.200]   and before that, Protestants. Now the annals of the Church are full of this sort of thing.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.440]   We don't know their names, but we know of them, the common people. And this, I say,
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.680]   has been one of the most glorious things in the long history of the Christian Church,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:33.040]   boldness, fearlessness, not foolhardiness, remember, not being ridiculous, but always
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.260]   being ready to give a reason for the hope that is in you, with confidence, with assurance,
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:45.640]   not allowing yourself to be intimidated by any earthly human power. But your loyalty
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.240]   is to him, and you have been given such a knowledge of him and his love to you, that
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:56.000]   you are ready to declare it with boldness and fearlessness, whatever the consequences
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.120]   may be. And we are living in an age in which this is still being done.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.920]   We thank God in our prayer for the martyrs in the Congo, and many of them did this very
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:15.340]   thing. It was their boldness, their fearlessness, that was such an offense to the others. And
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:20.960]   there are endless illustrations which one could give. I've known people myself, I remember
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:28.360]   two friends, oh, back about 1928, who'd passed through an experience like this with the Communists
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:34.440]   in China, threatened with death. And I'll never forget it, as long as I live, hearing
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:40.480]   certain men and his wife, who had been in that very position, Mr. and Mrs. Porteous,
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:46.480]   how they told that with the guns facing them, they just asked if they might be allowed to
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:55.400]   sing, "And I shall see him face to face, and tell the story saved by grace." And how that
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:01.480]   was used of God to lead to their release, and their being set free.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:09.520]   Well, now, here are some, you see, of these external signs. And they're clear and obvious
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.040]   to all. I've taken you through them in order that we all may examine ourselves, and ask
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   the question, "Is there something about me that has this impression upon men and women?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.640]   I'm a Christian, as these people were Christians. Is there that about me, which is having this
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:34.520]   impression, making this impact, leading men and women to consider these matters?" Those
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:43.200]   then are some of these external signs and results of the baptism of the Spirit.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.840]   Now I come to another division of this great matter. And I am free to confess that it is
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.120]   beyond any question the most difficult aspect of the whole subject. And yet, one's got to
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.040]   deal with it, it's in the Scriptures. And so, we come to it. The whole question of the
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:08.680]   gifts that result from the baptism of the Spirit in various ways. This is difficult
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:15.920]   mainly because it's controversial. It has certainly here difficulties, and the difficulties
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.680]   often arise because of our ignorance of the spiritual realm. But at this present moment,
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:29.800]   this is a very important matter. Important for two main reasons. One, that we need some
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:38.640]   supernatural, superhuman authentication of our message. And the second is, because of
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:45.440]   the dangers attending it. Because of the enemy you can counterfeit to such an extent as to
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:52.520]   deceive even the very elect themselves, according to our Lord and Saviour. It's his own teaching,
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:59.640]   it's his own warning in Matthew 24. He says they shall work signs and wonders, lying signs
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.840]   and wonders, which are so clever and subtle as almost to deceive the very elect themselves.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   Well then, there are those two main reasons why we must, of necessity, face honestly,
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.320]   in the light of Scripture, this all-important subject. Now take that first point I made.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.380]   Is it not becoming clear to everybody, at least it should be, that the Christian Church
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:28.280]   is failing, and failing lamentably today? Isn't it obvious to us that it isn't enough
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.120]   even to be orthodox? You must be orthodox, otherwise you haven't got a message. People
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.560]   are not going to listen to our speculations, they can speculate themselves. People want
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.000]   a word of authority. That's always been the case, and they will always recognize authority
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.840]   as I've shown to you. We need authority, we need some authentication. It isn't enough
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:53.320]   merely that we state these things, and demonstrate them, and put them logically. All that is
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.440]   essential, but it isn't enough. Is it not clear that we are living in an age when we
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   need some special authentication? That's the need for revival. Indeed, not earlier
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:17.400]   were we confronted by materialism, a worldliness, an indifference, a hardness, a callousness.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:23.440]   Increasingly one is hearing of, and reading in the newspapers, of certain manifestations
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:30.480]   of the powers of evil. It isn't merely sin that's constituting a problem in this country
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.120]   today. Have you read about the recrudescence of black magic, and devil worship, and things
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.160]   like that? This drug-taking, and some of the things it leads to? We are living in a society
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.920]   in which there are increasing evidences and manifestations of the power of evil spirits.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:56.800]   Well, there I say, you have what constitutes again perhaps the most urgent need of some
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:06.720]   manifestations, some demonstration of the power of the Holy Spirit. So, we are concerned
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:13.460]   about it for these two main reasons. Now, obviously, in the New Testament, and indeed
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:20.640]   in the whole of the Bible, we are taught that the baptism of the Spirit is attended by certain
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:28.000]   gifts. Joel, in his prophecy, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost, he foretells this.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.120]   Your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams, and so on. Your sons
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:41.600]   and your daughters shall prophesy. On my servants and on my handmaidens will I pour out in those
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in heaven above, and
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.560]   signs in the earth beneath, and so on. Very well, Joel, and the other prophets, you get
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.800]   it in the other prophets as well, they always indicate that in this age which was to come,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.720]   and which came with the Lord Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Spirit on the day of
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:10.640]   Pentecost, that there should be some unusual authentication of the message. And as we saw
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.760]   in the reading this morning from the fourteenth chapter of this Gospel according to Saint
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:22.920]   John, our Lord Himself prophesied this. You remember how He reasons with the unbelieving.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.200]   He says, "If you don't believe me, if you don't believe my words." Well, then He said,
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:34.640]   "Believe me for the very work's sake." His miracles were signs, as we know. That's the
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.400]   word, the term that is used in the Gospel of John with respect to them. The miracles
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.640]   were not merely done as acts of kindness. The main reason for the miracles was that
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:52.760]   they should be signs, authentications of who and exactly He was. Now, our Lord makes use
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:59.200]   of that. He says, "Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.120]   me for the very work's sake." And then He goes on, "I say unto you, he that believeth
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.760]   on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do because
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:16.360]   I go unto my Father." Now, our Lord was constantly using this very argument. You remember how
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.240]   He used it when John the Baptist sent two of his disciples unto him, asking, "Art thou
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.880]   he that should come, or do we look for another?" Jesus answered and said unto them, "Go and
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   show John again those things which ye do hear and see." The blind receive their sight,
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.400]   the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.040]   poor have the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:55.200]   in me." Matthew 11, 3-6. Very well then, it's clear from all this teaching leading
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.960]   up to the book of the Acts of the Apostles that this was to be expected. And the moment
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.920]   you come to the book of the Acts of the Apostles itself, well, there you find the evidence
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:14.760]   in great profusion, at once it begins. Cloven tongues as a fire, a visible sign, miracles
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:22.080]   of various descriptions, prophetic utterances, and so on. People described as having this
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.920]   gift of prophecy and of prophetic utterance, and so on. It runs right through the whole
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.320]   of the book of the Acts of the Apostles. But what is interesting is that it isn't confined
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.960]   to the book of the Acts of the Apostles. You get exactly the same thing taught in the various
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   epistles. Take, for instance, the famous passage in 1 Corinthians from chapter 12 right to
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:52.320]   the end of chapter 14. Chapters 12, 13, and 14 of the first epistle to the Corinthians
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:59.680]   deal exclusively with this great matter, showing that in the church at Corinth, as in all the
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.960]   other churches, this kind of thing was taking place, and so the apostle has to deal with
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.160]   the situation. And indeed, in writing the second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.840]   12, verse 12, where the whole question of his being an apostle has been raised by certain
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.160]   enemies and detractors, he turns and says, "Truly, the signs of an apostle were wrought
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:31.720]   among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds." The apostles' ministry
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.680]   was authenticated in that way. And then you will remember how many weeks back I quoted
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:43.920]   to you from the epistle to the Galatians, chapter 3, verses 2 and 5, "This only would
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.880]   faith." And then in verse 5, "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:01.080]   miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith."
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:09.920]   Now, the apostle says, "The Spirit came upon you because you have believed by faith."
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:15.560]   It is to believers that the Spirit is given in this way, in baptism, and the result was
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   that there was one working, that God ministered the Spirit to them, and miracles were being
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:26.920]   worked among them. And the apostle uses the same argument in that respect.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.200]   And then let me give you a final illustration of what I am trying to show in Hebrews 2 and
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:39.320]   in verse 4. He talks about the gospel, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:47.040]   and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him. God also bearing them witness, both with
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:54.680]   signs and wonders, and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:00.720]   his own will. Now, I am simply trying to establish this point,
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:07.200]   that it is perfectly clear that in the New Testament times, the gospel was authenticated
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:15.240]   in this way, by the signs and wonders and miracles of various characters and descriptions.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.360]   And you cannot begin to understand the New Testament, the epistles, as well as the book
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   of the Acts of the Apostles, without holding that in your mind, and seeing that that is
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.340]   clearly the case. Now, I believe that I am right in saying that
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.280]   everybody who is a Christian in any sense at all is prepared to believe that and to
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:46.160]   accept that. But, here is the point at which the vital question arises. Is all that which
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:56.080]   we accept only true of the early church? Was it only meant to be true of the early church?
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.400]   Now, that is the position which we have really got to deal with. There are many people who
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.440]   teach that. They say, of course, I accept the whole of that evidence. They may try even
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.960]   to water that down. I have known people do that. They have tried to explain away things
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:15.920]   that are clearly miraculous—the cloven tongues of fire and the speaking in other languages
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.680]   on the day of Pentecost. I have heard men using the greatest ingenuity to try to explain
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.880]   it away by some knowledge which they have just received about some odd dialects and
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.280]   so on. Now, I am not wasting my time with that kind
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.720]   of argument. I am dealing with people who say, of course, I accept everything that I
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.440]   find in the New Testament. I am sure it is historical that these things actually happened.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:48.520]   But, isn't it the case that that really doesn't apply to us now? It was only meant
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.000]   then. Now, these are some of the arguments which
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.880]   they bring forward. They tell us that all this was really meant simply to convince the
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:07.320]   Jews. Now, this is the argument that one finds particularly frequently in the writings of
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.760]   people who are called Brethren, Plymouth Brethren. This is their favorite argument. You get it
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.960]   in the writing of men like Sir Robert Anderson, and there are many others who have repeated
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.500]   the argument, and they are doing it today in various pamphlets and booklets.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:32.840]   They say, this was purely a matter of a sign for the Jews. The Jews were unbelieving. Our
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.360]   Lord gives that answer to John the Baptist. John was a typical Jew, and our Lord says
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.160]   to him, look here, the signs that were prophesied are taking place. There is your answer. And
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.800]   they go so far as to say, therefore, that all these signs and miracles in the New Testament
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   period were solely designed to appeal to the Jews and to convince them.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.240]   I was reading one of these quite recently, which actually says this, that after our Lord's
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.500]   own failure in his teaching, he came to found the kingdom, and he hoped he'd persuade them,
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.400]   but he didn't succeed. They put him to death. Well, then there was a kind of afterthought.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.920]   The Church comes in, and they say, then he made his last effort in the day of Pentecost
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:23.640]   and in the sending of this miraculous power amongst the apostles. It was the final appeal
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.080]   to the Jew. Now, that's the kind of thing which they teach.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.760]   And so, when they come to those people we looked at weeks back in the nineteenth chapter
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:41.040]   of Acts, those disciples that Paul came across at Ephesus, you remember, and to whom he put
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.880]   the question, did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed? They say, of course, these
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:50.520]   again were obviously Jews. But there's not a word to say that, not a word. But in order
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:55.480]   to fit into the theory, they have to say, these were Jews, though they lived in Ephesus
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:02.760]   and so on, whereas most authorities are agreed that these people were almost certainly people
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.680]   who had some connection with Alexandria in Egypt and so on. Certainly, that was the case,
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.280]   as we know, with regard to Apollos. However, they don't hesitate to say quite
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:17.760]   dogmatically that these people were Jews. Therefore, they spoke in tongues, Paul gave
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:23.720]   them this particular sign in order to answer them as Jews. Now, that's a very common
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.560]   argument. Then, another way in which the argument is
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:33.200]   put is this. It says, yes, of course, those things happened then. But they happened then
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:39.800]   because it was the beginning of the Christian church. And God, to set off the Christian
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.840]   church, as it were, did the unusual to give it a start. They say, you get that in the
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.520]   same kind of thing in the Old Testament, at the beginning of the great line of prophets.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:55.280]   In Elijah and Elisha, you read that they worked certain miracles. This was the start of the
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   line of prophets. They say, you always tend to get this sort of thing at the beginning
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.120]   of a work. But, of course, you don't expect it to go on. It's like a father setting
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.640]   up his son, gives him a farm, gives him a business, puts some money in the bank for
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.960]   him. No, then he says, get on with it. He doesn't go on giving him these gifts. He
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:20.560]   sets him on. Something unusual and exceptional at the beginning of a great work. So, they
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.600]   say, yes, this did happen, but it was only meant for the beginning of the dispensation.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:35.040]   Then another argument is this one, that these things happened, these signs were given, and
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:44.040]   these unusual powers and manifestations, only until the New Testament canon should have
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.920]   been completed. You see the argument. They say at the beginning, of course, they hadn't
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   got the New Testament epistles. We've got them. We've got the full truth put before
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:00.000]   us here, and we can read it and study it and expound it and understand it. But, of course,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.120]   in the early Church they hadn't got that. So then, God gave revelations to the apostles
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.440]   and to prophets and to certain other peoples at certain times. They were dependent upon
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:21.800]   this direct message and teaching. But, of course, they say the moment the Church was
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:27.240]   given the Scriptures, all that is no longer necessary. We've got the truth, so you don't
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:33.520]   need anything of the miraculous or the supernatural. Now, they're particularly fond of arguing
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:41.720]   that point in terms of the first epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 13. One of them actually
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:49.040]   puts it like this, "After the Scriptures were completed, these supernatural signs ceased."
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:56.800]   He makes a dogmatic pronouncement, and he says they ceased because they were no longer
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.760]   necessary once we had the Scriptures. Now, this is the argument which they tried to put
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:11.080]   forward. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 13, from verse 8 on, "Charity never failed. But whether
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:17.960]   there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:25.480]   there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:32.920]   But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:36.800]   And that which is perfect, you see, is the giving of the Scriptures, the New Testament
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:43.040]   Scriptures. That which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.800]   When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:56.680]   But when I became a man, I put away childish things such as prophecy, and speaking in tongues,
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.600]   and miracles, and things like that. I put away childish things. They actually say this
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.240]   in print. I could read it to you. That's the childish things that were put away. And
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.680]   now since we've got the Scriptures, we've got that which is perfect. "For now," he
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:17.760]   goes on, "we see through a glass, darkly, but then face to face." That's when you
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.280]   get the Scriptures, face to face. "Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:30.660]   as also I am known." Now they say all that means this, that until the Scriptures came,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:40.360]   it was all very partial. And the Apostle, they say, is there saying quite clearly that
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:48.760]   all this partial, all these supernatural manifestations and so on, belong to the realm of childish
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:54.680]   things which are to vanish away when the perfection and the fullness comes, and it did come when
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:41:00.360]   the New Testament canon was completed. And added to this, they produce a subsidiary argument.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.880]   They go so far as to say this, they say, you know, even in the New Testament itself, you've
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.000]   got clear evidence that these things were already passing away. What's the evidence?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.800]   Well they say, the fact that Paul couldn't heal Timothy, and has to tell him to take
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:23.560]   a little wine for his stomach's sake. That Trophimus was left sick and ill at Melita,
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:29.480]   and that Gaius was not healed, and that Epaphroditus was desperately ill, nigh unto death, but
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.960]   that the Lord had had mercy upon him, and that he'd got well again. They say, therefore,
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.720]   you see, even in the New Testament itself, you see these things passing away, starting
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.520]   on the day of Pentecost in great fullness, but gradually disappearing as you go on in
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:53.840]   the New Testament. And so they come to a final conclusion, which they state with the utmost
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:42:02.680]   confidence and dogmatism, that after the coming of the New Testament canon, all these gifts
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:10.420]   were entirely withdrawn. Now there is some of the argument that is being put forward
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:17.720]   at the present time, and has been put forward very largely during this present century.
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:23.280]   Now I must deal with this. I can't deal with it all this morning, unfortunately. I've
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:30.200]   stated the case to you. Let me just answer by giving you one answer this morning. The
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:39.240]   first is this. The Scriptures never, anywhere say that these things were only temporary.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.520]   Never. There is no such statement anywhere. "Ah, but, sir, somebody, what about what
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:51.000]   you've read from 1 Corinthians 10?" Well, I would have thought that that is a sufficient
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:57.920]   answer in and of itself to this particular criticism. You see what we are asked to believe
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.200]   on that kind of exposition. We are told that the coming of the New Testament Scriptures
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:12.040]   puts us into a place of perfection. Actually, it says this in verse 12, "For now," that's
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.840]   the apostle and others, he puts himself in, "we see." The apostle is included with
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.640]   all other Christian believers. Before the New Testament canon had been completed, so
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.960]   much of which was written by Paul himself, we are told, "Now we see through a glass
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:38.280]   darkly." But then, when the Scriptures have come and are completed, face to face, "Now
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:44.680]   I know in part." But then, which they say means the completion of the Scriptures, "Shall
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:57.720]   I know even as also I am known?" You see what that involves. It means this, that you
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:05.840]   and I, who have the Scriptures open before us, know much more than the apostle Paul did
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.440]   of God's truth and of Christian truth. That's what it means. Nothing else at all, if that
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:17.840]   argument is correct. It means that we are altogether superior to the early Church and
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.640]   even to the apostles themselves, including the apostle Paul. It not only means that,
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:32.680]   it means this, that we now are in a position that we know face to face, that we now, having
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:41.760]   the Scriptures of this knowledge, that we know even as also we are known by God. Surely
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:51.040]   it's unnecessary to say any more. What the apostle is dealing with in 1 Corinthians is
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:57.360]   the contrast between the highest and the best that the Christian can ever know in this world
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   and in this life and what he will know in the glory everlasting. That's the contrast.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.800]   The now and the then are not the time before the Scriptures were given and after, because
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.840]   that, as I say, puts us in a position entirely superior to the apostles and prophets who
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:21.560]   are the foundation of the Christian Church and on whose very work we have to rely. It's
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:28.360]   inconsistent, it's contradictory. Indeed, there's only one word to use, it is nonsense.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:40.400]   The then is the glory everlasting. It is only then that I shall know, even as also I am
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:51.160]   known. For then we shall see him as he is. It will be direct, it will be face to face,
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:46:01.720]   no longer, as he puts it, again in 2 Corinthians 3.18, no longer as an image, as it were, as
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:09.120]   a reflection, but direct, absolute knowledge, perfect knowledge, full knowledge. That's
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:15.880]   the contrast that is in 1 Corinthians 13. The implications of the other exposition are
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:22.680]   just ridiculous, false to experience, false to the teaching of the whole of the New Testament
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:30.360]   at the same time. So you see the difficulties men lend themselves in when they dislike something
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:36.080]   and can't fully understand it and try to explain it away. No, no, all things must be
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.280]   judged in the light of the Scripture, and we mustn't twist the Scriptures to suit
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:45.560]   our theory or our argument, whatever it may be. So I leave it this morning with this general
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:53.000]   statement that there is nothing in the Scripture itself saying that these things are to end.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:02.060]   And further, every attempt to make the Scriptures say that leads to the same dismal, impossible
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:08.400]   conclusions that we have already seen in the case of 1 Corinthians 13. Now, God willing,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.880]   we shall have to go on with this next Sunday morning.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   My friends, this is, to me, one of the most urgent matters at this hour. With the Church
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:25.640]   as she is, with the world as it is, the greatest need is the power of God through his Spirit
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:33.240]   in the Church, that we may testify, not even to the power of the Spirit, but to the glory
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:47.840]   and the praise of the one and only Saviour, Jesus Christ, our Lord, Son of God, Son of
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.960]   men. Amen.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:58.200]   Now our closing hymn this morning is hymn number 239, "Ye that do your Master's will,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:03.560]   meek in heart, be meeker still." 239.
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:29.840]   "Ye that do your Master's will, meek in heart, be meeker still.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:51.460]   And know unto him who is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:59.960]   the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour. Be
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:08.080]   glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. And may the grace of the Lord
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:14.400]   Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:20.760]   abide and continue with us now throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain,
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:34.880]   earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see his glorious face. Amen.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:38.960]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. All of
