[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The topic of today's deep dive is the 20% paradox.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Now I wanted to choose a topic that was gonna be relevant
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.520]   to the interview that follows in this episode.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.120]   So stick around for the interview that follows
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.960]   because you're gonna see some deep connections
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   between what my guest has to say
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.680]   and this topic I wanted to tackle here up front in the show.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.320]   So what is the 20% paradox?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.920]   It is the observation that if you take a knowledge worker
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.800]   who is burnt out or stressed about their work,
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.640]   which let's be honest is a large percentage
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760]   of knowledge workers right now,
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.360]   and you measure how much work are they doing
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.960]   above the threshold of sustainability.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.260]   So the level where if your work is below this volume,
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.320]   it's pretty sustainable, you're not super stressed about it,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.800]   your job is just what it is.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600]   How much work are they doing above that threshold?
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200]   What you find consistently is that it's gonna be
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.020]   somewhere around 20% too much work.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.680]   Not 60%, not 200%, not 100%,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.360]   but it's always right around 20%.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.440]   Now there are people who do, let's say 100% too much work.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if we, just for the sake of round numbers,
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540]   say nine to five, five days a week,
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.980]   if your work fits comfortably in there,
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.040]   that's pretty sustainable, we're used to that,
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.980]   we'll be okay with it.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.680]   So it's possible some people work 100 hour weeks
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.280]   and they need all 100 hours to get things done.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.120]   I know some people like that.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000]   That's very rare, right?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400]   Most people it's about 20%.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.360]   It's like me today, I'm a little stressed out today
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.320]   because I have probably one hour
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080]   too much stuff on my schedule.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.320]   If there was one hour worth of work removed,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.640]   like an appointment removed from today,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.960]   from my schedule, then we would be okay.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.480]   I'd have time to get everything done,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.940]   I'd have some margin, the day would end at the normal time
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.780]   and I'd be okay.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.300]   I don't have quite enough time after I record
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.520]   today's episode, I'm running out the door, 20% too much.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.620]   And this is what you find more or less
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.980]   when you study stressed out knowledge workers.
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.220]   So why do we fall?
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.860]   Why is the source of stress always this,
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.820]   coming from this relatively narrow quantity of overwork?
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.820]   Well, the wrong answer, the answer we tell ourselves
[00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.940]   when we interrogate our burnout is that I'm being asked
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.420]   to do the amount of work I'm being asked to do
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.540]   is about 20% too much.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.460]   I just look, I can't just say no to my boss,
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.140]   this is what's on my plate, what's on my plate
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.740]   is about 20% too much, it's I'm being asked to do too much.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.460]   The reality is though in almost every case,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.460]   you're saying no to most things that you're asked to do.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.420]   Most people don't realize this,
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.460]   but you're turning things down implicitly or explicitly
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.280]   through direct conversation or indirect action all the time.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.780]   And this kind of makes sense, right?
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.660]   Like what are the chances that of all the different people
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.260]   in your life, in your professional life
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.420]   who could make requests of you,
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.220]   who can put work on your plate?
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.820]   What are the chances that it just works out
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.340]   that all of the different requests
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.620]   that they throw your direction in an ad hoc manner
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.180]   with just Slack chats and grabbing you at a meeting
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.260]   or emails, what's the chances that when you add up
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.180]   all that work, it ends up to be exactly about 20%
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.740]   too many hours?
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.100]   That's not gonna happen,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.540]   that would be a cosmic coincidence.
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.020]   That's rolling 17 dice and having them all come up threes.
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.740]   What's really happening is that you're getting asked
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.620]   to do things all the time,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.820]   if you really added up the work of all the things
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.140]   you could be doing and all the things you could be accepting
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.980]   it would be more hours than there are in the week,
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.500]   it would be impossible, you're saying no to most things
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.740]   and the things you say yes to ends up being
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.260]   about 20% too much.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.380]   The reason why I think this happens,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.140]   and I've talked about this before on the show,
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.620]   but let's make it really clear here,
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.940]   is not about the logistics of work,
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.660]   it's not about administrative philosophies,
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.700]   it's not about time management strategies,
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.700]   it's about psychology.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.540]   It is difficult for humans to say no to other humans
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.940]   that are making a request of them,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.020]   and this would make complete sense if we wanna put on
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.220]   our somewhat suspect pop evolutionary psychology hat,
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.620]   this makes sense, right?
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.820]   I wanna avoid just those stories here,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.700]   but this makes sense because we're a tribal species,
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.780]   we're used to living in a small tribe of people
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.580]   who are related to us that we're fiercely loyal to.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.780]   In the tribal context that dominated
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.220]   for the first 300,000 years of our species existence,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.700]   requests were probably pretty serious,
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.220]   and there would be a real social consequence to saying no.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.580]   When your tribe member says,
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.740]   "I need you to watch my back as I attack this mammoth,"
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.420]   if you say no, that's a problem,
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.740]   you're gonna get a rock to the back of the head.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.420]   As you can tell, I know a lot of really good details
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.700]   about Paleolithic life.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.020]   All right, so we take requests from people we know
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.740]   in our tribe seriously, so it's very difficult to say no.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.220]   Okay, this is a mismatch, of course,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.100]   for a world of 700 other employees in your organization
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.700]   and human resources and other types of groups
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.700]   within your company that all need different things from you
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.860]   and who can make requests with basically no friction
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.260]   by sending you a quick email.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.420]   That brain, that Paleolithic brain is a mismatch here
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.700]   'cause here, it's not life and death.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.300]   Someone asking you to come participate in a panel
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.500]   is something that it's not a big deal if you say no to.
[00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.820]   No one's gonna get a rock to the back of their head,
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.740]   no one's gonna get gored by a mammoth,
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.540]   but our brain is concerned.
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.100]   So we have a hard time saying no,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.180]   it's a psychological problem.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.700]   What helps if we feel overloaded and stressed?
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.260]   This gives you, from a internal psychological perspective,
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.640]   coverage to say no.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.180]   Not coverage to the other person, coverage to yourself,
[00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.460]   your brain, your Paleolithic brain.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.620]   We can't say no, we can't say no.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.100]   You're like, I am so stressed.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.820]   Like, all right, I mean, we gotta say no.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.740]   We're overloaded.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.540]   I mean, look, this is an extreme circumstance.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.820]   I normally would say yes, but there's these other factors
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.220]   like our cortisol's up, our schedule's packed.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.360]   Like with reluctance, we have to say no.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.520]   I really do think, this is a big source of the 20% rule,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.540]   is that we engineer, we implicitly engineer
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.660]   the volume of our acceptances to get us a workload
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.820]   that's just heavy enough that we're in a persistent state
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.340]   of low-grade stress, and then that is where
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.400]   we then feel comfortable saying no to what follows.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.580]   The reason why we don't curve our workload 20% less
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.100]   below the sustainability threshold
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.380]   is because when our work is sustainable,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.380]   we don't have the psychological cover to say no.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.780]   It's a self-reinforcing feedback network
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.860]   that has a convergent steady state
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.620]   at the stressful side of that threshold.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.980]   So I think this is really important.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.900]   The other person doesn't care as much as you think
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.000]   when you're politely saying no,
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.020]   because you've already said no to them probably seven times
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.260]   for other things, you just didn't realize it.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.980]   They don't care, they don't know the difference.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.900]   Your CV, your resume, your bosses,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.440]   you think they really would know the difference
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.500]   between if you spent 20% less time.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.940]   That's not gonna show up.
[00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.500]   There's so much noise in how many things get accomplished
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.420]   or this thing took this much more time than this thing.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.440]   It's all a little bit apples to oranges.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.380]   20% less work doesn't necessarily even show up
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.540]   in a way that anyone is ever gonna notice.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.300]   The outside world can't see things at that granularity,
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.560]   but it can make all the difference
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.560]   to your personal sustainability, your personal satisfaction.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.640]   It's a small epsilon that if you close it,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   lots of good things happen,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.180]   but it's psychologically difficult to do.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.380]   So partially this is just expository.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.080]   It's a theory.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.480]   We're all stressed, but not like completely
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.760]   100-hour-a-week overloaded because it's a coping mechanism.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   Partly this is also advisory.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.000]   If we understand the 20% paradox,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.900]   maybe we will be a little bit more emboldened
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.060]   to just shave that extra epsilon of work off
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.260]   and fall back to a more sustainable place.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.980]   When we understand that we actually say no
[00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.100]   implicitly all the time, right?
[00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.240]   We do not have 60 hours of work
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.460]   exactly being put on our plate.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.420]   We have 200 hours being put on our plate
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.780]   and we say no to most of it.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.720]   Then saying no a couple more times is not so fraught,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.660]   but it's gonna make all the difference in the world.
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.040]   It's gonna be one less meeting today,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.260]   ending your day and moving to a shutdown ritual
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.580]   one hour earlier than normal,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.220]   starting your day one hour later,
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.980]   one more project off your plate,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.100]   one more year in between book projects.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.860]   I don't know, whatever adds up to 20%
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.740]   in your particular professional world,
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.820]   it can make all the difference.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.620]   So anyways, keep the 20% paradox in mind.
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.600]   It's a big driver of stress.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.460]   It's largely psychological.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.180]   Psychological problems have internal solutions.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:57.800]   So we have some hope here that we can make a difference.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.580]   (upbeat music)
