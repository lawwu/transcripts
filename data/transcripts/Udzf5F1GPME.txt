[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   So that's the deep question I want to tackle today.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.880]   Why doesn't cybernetic productivity work?
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:15.960]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.280]   the show about living and working deeply
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.640]   in a distracted world.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.460]   All right, once again, I am joining the show
[00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.460]   from Deep Work HQ North up in Hanover, New Hampshire.
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100]   My producer Jesse is joining us
[00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100]   from the original Deep Work HQ in Tacoma Park.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.220]   Jesse, hopefully Tacoma Park is doing okay
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.280]   without me around.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.620]   I don't know if you see people wearing black armbands,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.980]   mourners, mourners in the streets.
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.780]   - It's doing great, we're doing okay.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.260]   - You're doing okay.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.180]   Jesse went to the coffee shop,
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.140]   I will say frequent, earlier today,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.140]   and I asked him, did they have to lay some people off?
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.820]   Because with me being gone for two weeks,
[00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.620]   that's roughly, and I'm just doing the math here,
[00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.980]   $700 worth of income that they're not getting per day.
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980]   So, you know, it's a big deal when I'm not there,
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.660]   I drink a lot of coffee.
[00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.500]   So hopefully--
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   - What's your coffee shop up there?
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.020]   - It's a Keurig machine in my kitchen.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.300]   - That's all, really?
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.900]   - I do, there's a Keurig machine in my kitchen,
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.780]   I'm gonna make a lot of coffee.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780]   The other coffee, the actual coffee shop around here
[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.640]   that I like is called the Dirt Cowboy,
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.040]   which was around when I was here going,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.740]   to college at Dartmouth.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.960]   I like flavored coffee,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.700]   because I started drinking coffee in high school.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.020]   It's a long story, but the short version of the story was,
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.520]   I was taking computer science courses at Princeton,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.660]   during my senior year of high school,
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.660]   'cause I ran out of courses to take at my high school,
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.060]   and they had an agreement with Princeton,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.900]   and somehow that worked out,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900]   and I would stop on the way to Princeton
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.740]   and take these courses at the Tiger Mart,
[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.180]   at the Exxon on Route 31, in Pittington, New Jersey,
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.860]   and I would get in a styrofoam cup,
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.700]   their most flavorful coffee,
[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.680]   'cause it was terrible coffee,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.880]   and so I developed this habit of associated
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.520]   bad flavored coffee with thinking.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.780]   When it was Dirt Cowboy here in Dartmouth,
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.360]   is the only place I've ever found
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.760]   that does fancy flavored coffee.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.620]   They roast their own beans on site,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.420]   they flavor their own beans.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080]   If you order a ridiculous flavor like chocolate mint,
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.720]   they will grind a fresh batch right there,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.320]   and do a pour over for just that cup of coffee,
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.080]   and yet still has a crazy flavor.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.280]   So it's the only place I know
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.280]   that has fancy flavored coffee, so that's great.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.200]   But it's closed on Sunday and Mondays, which is crazy.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.480]   So I've been drinking some carrot recently.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   That's the way.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.360]   Otherwise, things are going well,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   and here's the good news,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.340]   if my plans hold up as we suspect,
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.380]   I will be back briefly in the DC area.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.640]   So next week's episode, Jesse,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   might have us both temporarily back
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.520]   in the original Deep Work HQ.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.000]   So everyone can look forward to seeing that.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.840]   - Sounds good.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.980]   - One advantage of being up here,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.080]   I have been getting a lot of reading done.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.200]   It is conducive to reading up here.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.040]   And I want to talk about a particular book,
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.440]   I'm gonna hold it up to the camera here,
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.960]   for those who are watching,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.200]   I guess I should specify this is episode 255.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   So if you're watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.760]   or on thedeeplife.com, look for episode 255.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.640]   I've been making my way through this beast, Jesse,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   this is "Power and Progress" by Darren Acemoglu
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.480]   and Simon Johnson from MIT.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.840]   It's one of these tech impact on economics and society,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.880]   sort of pseudo academic book.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.840]   I'm really enjoying it.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.940]   I'm almost done, I'm really enjoying it.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.720]   But there was one piece I came across this morning
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.500]   that I partially disagreed with,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.840]   and I realized in understanding my disagreement,
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.480]   there's actually an interesting point to be made
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   about the type of topics we talk about on the show.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.240]   So I'm actually gonna read something here, Jesse.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.600]   This comes from "Power and Progress."
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   It's a chapter about artificial intelligence.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.240]   And they're talking about,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.640]   they're referencing this famous conference
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.920]   that happened at Dartmouth back in the 1950s,
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.260]   so where I am right now,
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.840]   which was a conference organized by Marvin Minsky
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.740]   where the term artificial intelligence was coined.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.580]   All right, so in the section I'm about to read,
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.540]   they're referencing that conference.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.940]   And here's what the authors say.
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.740]   Even before the Dartmouth conference,
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.620]   MIT polymath Norbert Wiener
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.540]   had articulated a different vision,
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.860]   one that positioned machines as complements to humans.
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.060]   Although Wiener did not use the term MU,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.220]   which they used to mean machine usefulness,
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.260]   machine usefulness is inspired by his ideas.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.220]   What we want from machines
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.300]   is not some amorphous notion of intelligence
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.360]   or high level capabilities,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.180]   but they're used for human objectives.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180]   Focusing on MU rather than AI
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.940]   is more likely to get us there.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.940]   So what they're referencing here,
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.140]   if you read this whole chapter,
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.300]   what they're referencing is a pushback
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.060]   on what they say is the dominant current model
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.840]   for thinking about artificial intelligence,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.120]   which according to them,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.500]   it's being seen as something to automate
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.940]   or replace flawed humans,
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.740]   that computers can be more perfect or logical than humans,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.380]   and we can use computers to replace flawed humans,
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.180]   to automate human activity.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.060]   And they go back and say,
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.500]   we have a different idea,
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.060]   which is instead of AI, MU, machine usefulness.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.020]   We should use tools like artificial intelligence
[00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.200]   to make individuals more useful,
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.280]   to expand their capabilities.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.620]   And the reason why they're referencing Norbert Wiener
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.580]   is that in the 1940s,
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.140]   he wrote this book on the term cybernetics,
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.980]   which was his term for a symbiosis
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.420]   between humans and machines.
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.400]   He had this argument that machines can help humans,
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.460]   but can't replace humans.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.960]   What we should be thinking about as engineers
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.500]   is how to integrate humans and machines
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.260]   into a cybernetic relationship.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.960]   I actually own a vintage copy of this book
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.220]   back at my house in Tacoma Park.
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.660]   Wiener was inspired a lot, if you read that book,
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.040]   at working in the war efforts for, among other things,
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.240]   anti-aircraft guns,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.060]   where they were trying to build these systems
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.540]   where the human is aiming the anti-aircraft gun,
[00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.740]   and there's a feedback loop,
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.060]   where the anti-aircraft gun is giving feedback to the human
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.740]   to help them be more accurate as they aim it,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.140]   to extend their capabilities to lead these planes
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.540]   or predict where they're going.
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.260]   And that symbiosis between the person
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.420]   and the anti-aircraft gun
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.420]   was an early example of cybernetics.
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.860]   And so these authors are saying, that's what we need.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.360]   Not replacing people with technology,
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   but using technology to extend their capabilities.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.840]   Now, here's my critique.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.760]   When it comes to the specific slice of the economy
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.680]   that we so often talk about on this show,
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.580]   which is knowledge work,
[00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.180]   a term I actually learned from Derek Thompson the other day
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.700]   was laptop workers.
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.580]   So people who you're on a computer screen
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.660]   and you're doing email and all sorts of back and forth.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.980]   For knowledge workers, I would say,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.460]   the fundamental thrust of these new technologies
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.620]   like artificial intelligence
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.220]   is exactly a cybernetic vision.
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.260]   I have been studying and thinking a lot
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.440]   about the intersection of artificial intelligence
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.380]   and work recently,
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.100]   'cause I'm working on an article on this topic.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.980]   And I can tell you most of the visions out there right now
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.800]   when it comes to these tools and knowledge work
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.300]   is not how do we replace these workers?
[00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.140]   It is instead, how do we give them new capabilities,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.760]   simplify things, allow them to do things
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.180]   they weren't able to do before?
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.060]   So actually, that mentality is already out there,
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.460]   at least when it comes to knowledge work.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.660]   And if we really look deeper,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.540]   we say most of the discussion of productivity,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.640]   so that the common public discussions of productivity
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.420]   as it relates to knowledge workers in particular
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.420]   has this cybernetic flavor to it.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.700]   How do we use tools to speed up or simplify
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.400]   or expand what humans can do?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.220]   So I'm gonna even introduce a term and say,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.420]   let's call this cybernetic productivity.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.940]   This is a huge topic of the last 20 years.
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.460]   This intersection of digital technology and productivity
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.960]   has led to this notion of cyber productivity,
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.980]   cybernetic productivity,
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.500]   which is all about how do we use tools
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.580]   to make certain tasks easier to extend
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.540]   or speed up the capabilities of human workers.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.260]   And the thing that I was realizing
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.900]   as I was thinking about today
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.580]   is that cybernetic productivity
[00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.040]   has failed to live up to its promise.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.160]   And I think if we understand
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   why it has failed to live up to its promise,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.340]   we're gonna learn something about
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.620]   how we might better organize work.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.620]   So that's the deep question I wanna tackle today.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.520]   Why doesn't cybernetic productivity work?
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.480]   All right, so to tackle this question,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.900]   let's get some good definitions going here.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.260]   What exactly is meant by cybernetic productivity?
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.620]   I would define it by four principles,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.980]   three that have been around for the last 20 years
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.960]   and one that's become more popular in recent years.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.180]   So the first principle of cybernetic productivity
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.900]   is that you should attempt to automate
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.240]   or speed up shallow tasks as much as possible.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.540]   So anything that is overhead or logistical or administrative
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.140]   that you can make faster, make faster.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.940]   If you can automate it all together,
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.420]   automate it all together.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.540]   Have this software tool,
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.740]   be able to speak to that software tool
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.740]   so you can directly send your data from your browser
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.380]   over to your Excel spreadsheet
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.580]   without having to waste a bunch of clicks.
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.180]   If there is a more advanced command
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.660]   that can do a few steps for you,
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.980]   let's try to introduce that
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.980]   so that you don't have to keep doing
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.740]   multiple work on its own.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.220]   If you can, for example,
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.460]   fill in while I'm writing in Gmail,
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.500]   guess what I'm trying to say,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.600]   then I can just press tab
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.380]   and not have to write the whole thing, do that.
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.580]   So any place you can speed up or automate work
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.580]   that's not directly just thinking deeply
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.780]   or producing value,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   cybernetic productivity says you should.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.260]   The second principle of cybernetic productivity
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.020]   is to try to keep needed information at your fingertip.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.340]   So it's all about making it easy for you to organize
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.920]   and get access to the information you need.
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.980]   This particular paradigm of effectiveness
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.500]   sees humans in part as information processing machines.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.780]   So it says, hey, the more we can have
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.180]   the right information there when you need it,
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:43.020]   the more effective knowledge workers are going to be.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.740]   So certainly tools like Google, for example,
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.920]   live out this principle.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.020]   I can search for a lot of different types of information.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.440]   As why Gmail has sort of advanced search
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.660]   built right into its email.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.300]   So you can go back and find information
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.860]   that you needed before.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.940]   There's all other sorts of information
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.640]   and knowledge management tools
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.180]   that all implement this cybernetic productivity principle
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.500]   of let's make sure information is never too far,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.460]   never too far from the person who needs it.
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.100]   We need to get away from this 1970s era style
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.460]   of knowledge work where you're walking down
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.340]   to the central library and you're building
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.980]   and making a request for information
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.580]   that comes back on clippings, you know, two hours later,
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.140]   information at your fingertips.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.940]   All right, the third principle of cybernetic productivity
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.000]   is removing friction from communication.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.940]   So again, this view of humans as individuals doing work
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.980]   is one that is inherently collaborative.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.340]   And so cybernetic productivity says
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.700]   we need to make this communication easy.
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.820]   If we take friction out of the process,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.460]   I can just reach you as quickly and easily as possible,
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.460]   a higher velocity of collaboration is then enabled.
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.260]   So this is why we were able to use digital tools
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.940]   to move past, for example, the slowness
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.380]   of inter-office memos or having to type a code
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.260]   into a telephone to see what voicemail messages we had.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.900]   Now with email, we could just type in it,
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.900]   would immediately be sent to you.
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.540]   I would have a copy.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.820]   I can attach files to it.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.900]   Slack brought this to a new tempo of speed.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.820]   Now we can just be going back and forth,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.420]   not have to wait for messages themselves
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.220]   to arrive and be seen.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.740]   And then we get things like the advent of smartphones
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.700]   and ubiquitous high-speed wireless internet.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.460]   So now not only is it low friction to message you,
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.820]   I can do it anywhere.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.600]   I don't even have to wait till I'm back at an office
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.900]   or at a phone to talk to you.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.860]   So that's a key cybernetic productivity,
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.100]   get rid of that friction.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.100]   Communication should be as easy as possible.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.680]   This fourth newer principle I alluded to
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.220]   was to simplify the extraction
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.180]   of actionable wisdom from data.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.940]   So that's another newish aspect of cybernetic productivity.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.140]   It thinks the data, the information we need to do things
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.660]   is often hidden in data.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.320]   So we need tools that can find trends.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.980]   We need tools that can extract wisdom from data.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.800]   So we also have that on our fingertips to act.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.100]   All right, so that is the cybernetic productivity vision.
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.500]   It's one where the human is in the center of this network
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.220]   of all of this different information
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.860]   and communication and data.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.260]   Meanwhile, all of the literal steps and actions
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.840]   needed to access this information, to find it,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.300]   to analyze it is automated or sped up as much as possible.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.340]   That is the cybernetic productivity vision.
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.620]   It has been dominant since I would say the early 2000s.
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.480]   And it also, in my opinion, has proven to be a failure.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.000]   Cybernetic productivity does not make us
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.940]   feel more productive.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.260]   Cybernetic productivity has not been moving the needle
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.340]   on actual measurable productivity metrics.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.700]   We are not getting more important work done.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.140]   And there's a key reason for this.
[00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.120]   It's what I call the infinite buffer effect.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.720]   In many knowledge work jobs,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:04.220]   the supply of work is essentially infinite.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   There's always more things you could be doing.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.380]   And this is because there is a key implicit decision made
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.860]   in many knowledge work organizations,
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.500]   which is that potential tasks
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.540]   should be stored at individuals.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.580]   You just push things towards people to hold on to
[00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.500]   until they're ready to work on it.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.020]   So you have this buffer of work that's always growing.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.920]   There's always more work in there than you can do.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.220]   Having a infinite buffer connected
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.260]   to cybernetic productivity does not work
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.060]   because what cybernetic productivity does
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.620]   is it speeds up all the shallow, the visible shallow tasks,
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.380]   the overhead surrounding deeper work.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.000]   It makes that go faster.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.360]   That frees up time.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.840]   New work comes in from the buffer to fill it.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   So the faster you're able to do this overhead
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.220]   surrounding your projects,
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.780]   the more projects are gonna just fall in from your buffer
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.740]   onto your plate at the same time.
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.740]   And that's because the deep efforts are less visible
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.820]   and those are more autonomous.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.940]   So we don't imagine those of actually taking up
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.820]   or requiring time.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.220]   The thing that's very visible
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.980]   is the actual interactive elements,
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.940]   the talking to people, the finding the data,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.140]   the jumping onto the meeting.
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.700]   So as that gets faster,
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.500]   more work falls out of this buffer
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.900]   to fill in the voids this creates.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.660]   And so we just actually end up more and more busy.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.160]   And if we push this to an extreme,
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.520]   we get to a place where we're spending all of our time
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.440]   incredibly efficiently,
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.320]   jumping from project to project,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.760]   barely hitting keystrokes.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   Google is finding this information
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.280]   or maybe if we're more advanced,
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.440]   chat GPT is grabbing the information for us.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.000]   They were automatically sending it over
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.400]   between different types of tools.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.200]   And this data automatically goes over there
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.800]   and it's the cloud and it syncs on my thing.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.520]   We're moving faster and faster and faster
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.700]   and more and more work comes in to fill that void.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.160]   And in the end, there's no time left to actually
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.860]   do the important stuff all this overhead's
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.100]   trying to support in the first place.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.380]   And so we feel tired, we feel exhausted.
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.460]   The context switches are making us dumber
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.820]   and we're spending less time
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.700]   actually doing the underlying work that creates value,
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.100]   the actual work that is valued in the marketplace.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.140]   I think a great example of this
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.980]   is to compare me to my grandfather.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   We were both professors.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.180]   He was a notable professor.
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.460]   He did not own his first computer until after he retired.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.480]   I helped him set it up.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.320]   I remember that.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.540]   So his overhead, the shallow work
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.060]   that Cybernetic Productivity deals with,
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.260]   he was incredibly slow with that
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.560]   as compared to someone like me
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.780]   working 30 years later than him.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.420]   No computer, no email.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.780]   He didn't even have a word processor.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.700]   He would write his books and articles longhand
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.340]   on legal pads and then someone else,
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:34.420]   his secretary would take it and a typist would type it up
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.980]   and he would bring it back and he would mark it up.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.340]   He would write letters by hand and memos.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.000]   He'd make a lot of phone calls.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.980]   All of this stuff was way slower
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.820]   than what we could do today.
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.560]   And yet he wrote something like 15 books.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.060]   Endowed chair, eventually a provost of a university.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.440]   He was an incredibly successful professor.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.520]   We had the same job.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.320]   He didn't have any of these high-speed
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.640]   Cybernetic Productivity tools
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.520]   and yet at the core things that matter,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.040]   mentoring students, teaching and research,
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.220]   he did this at a much higher level
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.320]   than the average professor,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.560]   at a much higher level than even I am able to do today
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.280]   because actually speeding up that overhead
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.540]   probably would have just brought more overhead into his life
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.820]   and as you bring more overhead into your life,
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.540]   you don't write books faster,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.780]   you don't mentor your students better,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.820]   you don't teach better.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.000]   So this is where I think Cybernetic Productivity failed
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.760]   is this infinite buffer effect.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.160]   You speed up the overhead of work,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.480]   we just put more work on our plate,
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.440]   we put more work on our plate, everything gets worse.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.760]   This is why I think it's a key explanation
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.160]   for some of the antipathy knowledge workers feel
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.480]   towards notions like productivity
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.680]   because when they hear that term,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.120]   they think about Cybernetic Productivity
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.740]   and they associate this with exhaustion.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.280]   All right, so now that we've named this a philosophy,
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.880]   we've seen why it's not working well,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.580]   we can ask what we can do about it.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.960]   What are some solutions to the shortcomings
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.920]   of Cybernetic Productivity?
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.520]   I have three quick ideas to mention.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.340]   Number one would be managing workloads centrally.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.000]   So Cybernetic Productivity failed
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.720]   because of the infinite buffer effect.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.160]   The infinite buffer effect is created
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.800]   because individuals typically are in charge
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.040]   of managing the organization's work.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.760]   Everything that exists that needs to be done
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.560]   is on somebody's plate, existing in a message
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.440]   in their inbox or a comment that was made after a meeting
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.880]   where someone said, "Hey, can you handle this?"
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.680]   If you wanna get rid of the infinite buffers,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.200]   have an alternative system in which the potential work
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   is not stored by individuals, but is stored centrally.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.480]   And that the individuals only work
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   on a small number of things at a time.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.940]   And when they're done, they can then pull new work
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.400]   from this central system.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.920]   Now, some people who have an optimization mindset say,
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.280]   well, what's the difference if it's on my plate
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.840]   or a central system, you work on what you work on,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.080]   but it's not how things work.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.560]   When you have five projects on your plate,
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.580]   you're gonna start working on them
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.480]   if you have the time to do it.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.920]   If on the other hand, there's four projects
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.680]   in a central system that you'll go back to
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680]   and get a new one when you're done,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.160]   you're just gonna be stuck with the one.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.140]   Cybernetic Productivity is actually quite useful
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.040]   if you're only working on a small number of things.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   If you have nothing else to fill the time,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.240]   speeding up the shallow work and the overhead
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.120]   really does just give you more time to work
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.540]   on the main deep meat of the project.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.160]   So actually having a small buffer works well
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.440]   if you have Cybernetic Productivity implemented.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.860]   All these tools that we're investing in,
[00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.480]   all these tools that people talk about
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.720]   and talk endlessly about on YouTube,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.880]   actually are pretty useful if your work buffer's not too big
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.320]   so manage it centrally.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.080]   This is hard to do in big organizations.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.500]   It requires a central reorg, but if you work for yourself,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.900]   you can simulate this.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.740]   Have a clear distinction.
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.860]   These are things I'm going to work on.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.620]   I can store information about them.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.980]   If I have ideas about them, I can update them in the system.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.360]   If someone sends a message relevant to a pending project,
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.300]   I can put them on there, but there's a firewall
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.460]   between those and what I'm working on now.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.520]   And the things I'm actually working on is limited.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.020]   You can make that clear distinction
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.800]   and psychologically it's gonna make a difference
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.460]   'cause it will get rid of the infinite buffer effect.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.200]   All right, the second solution here,
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.520]   reintroduce some friction.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.820]   Sometimes this is what you have to do
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.660]   if you can't get around the infinite buffers,
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.860]   is say, "Actually, I don't want all of this overhead
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.520]   "and shallow work to be faster.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.240]   "I want it to be enough of a pain
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.620]   "that I'm not going to bring more projects
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.780]   "into my active purview because my mental association
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.300]   "about what they take up is gonna be differing.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.220]   "Like, it's a pain to work on projects.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.120]   "I can't move through things very quickly."
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.000]   This might mean, for example, I don't know,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.260]   you can't email me.
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.440]   Here's my office hours, we have a weekly meeting.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.920]   This is how we talk.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.720]   You have to wait for that to talk to me.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.360]   I'm a pain to work with.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.280]   That slows down how many projects
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.880]   can be going on at the same time.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.240]   Maybe you use on purpose old tools.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.840]   You might not go back as far as my grandfather did it
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.480]   and write on yellow legal pads,
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.760]   but maybe you're not trying to get
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.800]   the very latest information organizational tools.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.680]   You print things and put them in files and it takes time
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.120]   and you might have to spend the whole morning
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.040]   to significantly upgrade your research files.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.000]   You can't just clip things with plugins
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.880]   that you browser extensions you click in Chrome
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.660]   that automatically put a copy over in Evernote
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.600]   and syncs it up with your Obsidian setup.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.200]   Maybe you want it to be older and more creaky
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.360]   so that when you think about doing research for something,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.480]   you're thinking about spending hours and hours
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.720]   or putting days aside to do it.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.080]   This might seem like you're losing time,
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.320]   but that might stop you from starting another project.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.840]   It might help keep you focused.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.360]   So keep these types of things in mind.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.920]   Don't necessarily make yourself faster.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.440]   Being too fast might make you work on too much.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.760]   And of course the final solution,
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.480]   which is the big solution we talk about a lot on this show
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.480]   is to stop caring so much about cybernetic productivity
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.220]   and spend more time caring about
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.080]   the type of attention citric productivity
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   that we talk about here.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.700]   So attention citric productivity,
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.940]   which we also call multi-scale productivity
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.560]   has nothing to do with how fast you execute things
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.280]   and everything to do with how you allocate
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.660]   your limited time and attention.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.680]   There's different scales this can execute on.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.080]   So in the short term attention citric productivity
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.360]   might mean you're being careful about
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.500]   how do I decide what to work on next?
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.840]   How do I set things up so once I choose to do something,
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.720]   I've made my environment such that I have a,
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.040]   made conditions well to actually accomplish it
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.120]   at a high level.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.960]   I'm not distracted on the deep things.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.560]   The shallow things are batched, et cetera.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   On the medium term attention citric productivity
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.720]   is about well how do you organize
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.120]   and control the things that are on your plate
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.960]   to make sure you're not forgetting about things,
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.800]   that it's simplified for you to make decisions
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.980]   about what should be worked on when.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.000]   And at the long term attention citric productivity
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.900]   is about how do you decide what comes onto your plate
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.920]   in the first place.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.760]   Here you might even change your job
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.080]   or how your organization runs.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.560]   It makes major changes to make sure that
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.700]   what you're expected to do is reasonable.
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:05.920]   Attention citric productivity doesn't particularly
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.800]   care about speed.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.640]   It's not against it.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.360]   If you have particular tools that speed up certain things
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.920]   or eliminate certain annoying activities you don't like,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   great, but it sees that as a personal preference
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.840]   and not critical to actually producing important work
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.800]   in a sustainable way.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.760]   Attention citric productivity says what really matters
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.920]   is how you figure out what to do with your time.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.360]   What's a reasonable load,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.560]   how to succeed with what you're doing,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.640]   how to keep tabs on what you're doing,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.480]   how to make smart decisions about what to work on when.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.040]   This is typically what I think about
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.400]   when I think about productivity.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.600]   And it's why there's often a gap between me
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.840]   and say YouTube productivity people
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.160]   who love cybernet productivity.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.580]   It's why there's often a gap between me
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.040]   and the anti productivity crowd
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.800]   desperately trying to get you to subscribe
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.800]   to their sub stack while they're writing sub stack articles
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.340]   about why capitalism is bad
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.320]   and you shouldn't try to make money,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.200]   but give me money because I need money
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.640]   to talk about why capitalism is bad
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.680]   because this crowd is thinking
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.000]   about cybernetic productivity.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.680]   I'm thinking about attention centric productivity.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.200]   So we get down to the bottom here,
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.440]   a core distinction between productivity
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.080]   based on using tools to speed us up
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.720]   and productivity based on using our own minds and intuition
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.040]   to be intentional about how we approach our work.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.720]   This ladder is not as interesting or as sexy.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.240]   AI is not gonna have a big impact here.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.560]   There's no note taking software
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.200]   that's gonna have a big impact here.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.440]   There's no particular app
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.560]   that's gonna have a big impact here.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.020]   A lot of it's gonna be Google Docs and Trello
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.120]   and just careful reflection
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.720]   on the different elements of your jobs,
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.940]   but it tends to work a lot better.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.060]   So anyways, this is just a riff.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.600]   Jesse, I just was reading about Norbert Wiener
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.100]   and artificial intelligence.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.300]   I just had this riff of like, wait a second,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.000]   whatever they call it here, machine usefulness.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.320]   That's all we do in knowledge work
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.200]   and it's still not working.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.880]   It's because we don't know what's useful
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.600]   and speed itself is not useful.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.560]   So there we go.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.320]   Cybernetic productivity, I shrug my shoulders.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.640]   I think there's better ways to organize
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.880]   what we need to get done.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.200]   - That's good stuff.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.360]   I never knew your grandfather wrote 15 books.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.680]   - Well, it's something like that.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.340]   I mean, I might be making up that particular number,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.180]   but it's something like that.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.200]   He was a very productive scholar.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.040]   He wrote a lot of books,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.160]   wrote a lot of articles, multiple doctorates,
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.360]   spent time with a lot of cool people.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.520]   He spent, there's a biography of him,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.440]   but he spent time,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.140]   so I learned some of this more recently,
[00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.800]   but he spent time at Union Seminary
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.520]   and he would walk Central Park with Heschel.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.880]   He spent a little bit of time out in Switzerland
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.680]   and got to know Carl Jung later in his life,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   was a big admirer of Niebuhr
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.320]   when he spent some time at Harvard.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.200]   He spent a lot of time at a lot of universities,
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.240]   a lot of sabbaticals and off years.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   But I just remember that, notepads.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.800]   He wrote everything on notepads and had a lot of books.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.760]   He didn't really understand the internet.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.220]   He had a lot of books,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.560]   which is slower than being able to look something up.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.480]   But I don't know that slow was bad.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.520]   Slow was not bad.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.000]   He produced a lot of things and was pretty successful.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.520]   So anyways, what I've done is I've gathered
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.920]   a collection of questions to do next
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.240]   that all roughly sort of touch on cybernetic productivity
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.080]   or the alternatives to cybernetic productivity.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.560]   And so I wanna get to those in a second,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.640]   but before we do, I wanna talk about
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.280]   a sponsor of this show, Shopify.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.820]   (bell rings)
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.400]   You hear that sound?
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.160]   That's the sound of another sale on Shopify,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.200]   the moment that another business dream becomes a reality.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.360]   So I don't know if you know about Shopify,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.040]   but it is a commerce platform
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.600]   that is revolutionizing millions of businesses,
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.720]   world wide.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   So whether you are selling a time block planner
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:00.320]   or a anachronistically old fashioned yellow pad clip
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.100]   that you can use for writing your books
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.280]   with inspirational slogans on it that says,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.120]   forget cybernetic productivity or go deep or go home,
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.160]   whatever it is that you're selling.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.360]   These are all great ideas, by the way.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.040]   These are all e-commerce gold I'm giving you right now.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.560]   Shopify will simplify selling online and in person
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.200]   so you can focus on successfully growing your business.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.480]   The way I've always known Shopify, the people I use it,
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.440]   is it just makes it easy for you to have
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.840]   an incredibly professional and easy to use
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.380]   e-commerce storefront.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.400]   You don't have to just sort of give in
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.820]   and sell through an existing giant.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.720]   They allow you to cover every sales channel
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.880]   from in-person POS systems to all-in-one e-commerce.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.680]   It even lets you sell across social media marketplaces
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.280]   if you want, like Facebook and Instagram.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.680]   I don't know how successful my get off social media,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.280]   get off social media, you dork, baseball caps.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.800]   Those probably aren't gonna sell well on TikTok,
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.960]   but Shopify would allow me to try that if I wanted to.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.600]   They have all sorts of industry leading tools
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.640]   ready to ignite your growth.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.360]   So you have complete control of your business and your brand
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   without having to learn new skills or design and code.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.920]   You know, I'll tell you back in the late 90s, early 2000s,
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.880]   when I had my teenage.com business,
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.240]   e-commerce, professional e-commerce
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.800]   meant huge amounts of money.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.760]   Whole teams you would have to hire,
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.000]   back-end coders, front-end internet designers.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   It was a huge pain.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.840]   I would have killed to have something like Shopify back then
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.120]   because you have a professional, fully featured storefront
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.000]   that looks great and works great,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.800]   and you don't have to code,
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   and you don't have to hire the 18 year old version of me
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.440]   to build you a website.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   So it's a good service and something you need to know
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.920]   if you sell basically anything.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.440]   So now it's your turn to get serious about selling
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.320]   and try Shopify today.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.280]   Sign up for a $1 per month trial period
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   at shopify.com/deep, all lowercase.

[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   to the next level today at shopify.com/deep.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.720]   I also wanna talk about our friends
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.440]   and longtime sponsor, Grammarly.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.540]   So as you know, we've been talking about
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.360]   new artificial intelligence technologies on this show often
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   as I've been reporting on this topic.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   And one of the points I've been making
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.840]   is I'm not very sympathetic to these arguments
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.080]   about new artificial intelligence technologies
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.640]   about to have these mammoth impacts.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.120]   It's gonna be intelligent.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.920]   It's gonna send the terminators after you.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.400]   All jobs are about to disappear.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.920]   I think the really interesting stories
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.720]   are about focused applications.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.600]   Putting in particular generative AI technologies
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.920]   to use in very focused applications
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.640]   where they support something that a tool was already doing.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.840]   Grammarly is a great example of this
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:03.800]   because of their new product Grammarly Go,
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.800]   a communication assistant that is powered by generative AI.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.280]   Grammarly Go understands your unique context,
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.760]   your preferred voice and goals
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.960]   to help you quickly generate high quality writing
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.800]   with just a few clicks.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:21.800]   You can ideate, compose, rewrite and reply thoughtfully.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.780]   So for example, one of the things you can use Grammarly Go
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.400]   for is you're writing whatever app you normally write in.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:32.440]   If this clicks into the existing places you already write,
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.060]   you might say to Grammarly Go,
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:39.080]   can you give me some ideas on how to decorate a taco truck?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.960]   Or what are 10 possible captions
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.320]   for this thing I just wrote?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.800]   And it uses the power of generative AI
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.080]   to give you things right there to work with.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.720]   It can also help you adjust your tone or clarity or length.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   You can write something kind of boring
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.200]   and then say to Grammarly Go, make this more exciting.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.780]   Or you can write something kind of quickly and say,
[00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.680]   hey, can you make this sound more professional?
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.520]   It rewrites your text into that tone.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.680]   So you can get high quality writing
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.880]   and yet spend less time word smithing.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.960]   You could even get drafts of paragraphs
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.120]   that you can start working with,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.760]   such as, hey, compose me a paragraph
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.840]   about how TikTok works.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.680]   Then you work on that and integrate into what you're doing,
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.280]   but it saved you there some steps.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:22.640]   So anyways, I think Grammarly Go
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.520]   is a exciting new step forward for Grammarly.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.200]   It applies generative AI in a nicely focused way
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.720]   to help solve a very specific problem
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.060]   that is very relevant.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:36.720]   If you work in knowledge work in any way,
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.500]   clarity of communication is critical.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.080]   Grammarly has always helped you communicate more clearly.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.460]   Grammarly Go takes that to the next level.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.060]   So you'll be amazed at what you can do with Grammarly Go.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:51.060]   So go to grammarly.com/go to download and learn more.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   That's G-R-A-M-M-A-R-L-Y.com/go.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.560]   All right, Jesse, speaking of go,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.520]   let us go on to the next segment of the show
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.720]   and answer some questions.
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.760]   Who do we have first?
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.480]   - All right, first question's from Jeff from Toronto.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.000]   Every interview I've ever been in
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.160]   has some question about time management or prioritization.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.000]   What's the right way for me to ask about this
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.720]   when I'm trying to hire somebody?
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.080]   Should I ask the potential hire about their systems?
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.960]   - Well, Jeff, it's an interesting question.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   As someone who hasn't really done a lot of job interviews,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   at least not since I interviewed for Microsoft in college,
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.920]   that might've been the last job interview.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.760]   Well, I guess I interviewed for it to be a professor.
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.960]   So that's like a job interview,
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.880]   but that's different because it takes all day
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.040]   and it's a stylized thing where you're giving talks
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.440]   and you have this CV.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.380]   But the last sort of corporate job interview I ever did
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.360]   was Microsoft and Jesse,
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.440]   I don't know if I've told you this story,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.680]   but the way they did it back then,
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.320]   this would have been 2004, was kind of brutal, right?
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.960]   So if you made it to the stage
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.840]   where they were gonna fly you out to Redmond
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.080]   to interview for this position,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.120]   you started in a conference room
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.680]   with all of the other people they flew out,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.800]   there'd be 10 people in the conference room.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.080]   And you knew you were all interviewing
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.240]   for the same position.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.280]   In this case, it was this project manager program
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.480]   that Steve Ballmer had created
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.600]   where they took computer scientists
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.760]   and they send you to business school
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.600]   and this was a competitive position.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.320]   As the day goes on,
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.680]   you would interview with more and more people.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.520]   And as the day goes on,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.360]   they'd move you to more and more senior people.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.500]   But here was the catch.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.160]   They started sending people home as the day progressed.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.000]   - Really?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.320]   - Yeah, so as the day progressed,
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.800]   you would come back to the conference room,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.720]   there'd be less people.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.780]   And you'd get the lunch, there'd be less people.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.620]   You'd get through the afternoon.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:41.880]   So they were weeding people out, right?
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.020]   'Cause they didn't wanna waste the time
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.260]   of the higher up people.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.200]   Because they're engineers and they're being very optimal.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   And engineers don't always understand things,
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.920]   for example, like how the human emotions work.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.280]   So in the engineer's mind, they were thinking,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.540]   well, we don't want,
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.960]   when we get up to a senior vice president,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.240]   we don't want them talking to people.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.760]   So they started, so you come back.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.600]   And I guess they were just telling people like,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.160]   okay, you're done, you can go home.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.280]   And so there was less and less of us until,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.820]   and spoiler alert and not the humble brag,
[00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.200]   but I was the last one left and got the job offer.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.080]   By the end of the day,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.120]   it was like me and one other guy that were left.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.480]   And then the final people we were interviewing with,
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.000]   the final guy, I don't know who it was,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.760]   but I remember him talking about,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.920]   oh, I was just over at Bill's house last night
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.040]   and we were blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   It was going on about how he was like close with Bill Gates.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.440]   So this must have been someone who was really high up.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.880]   Anyways, that was my experience
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   with corporate job interviews.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.900]   It was basically survivor.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.340]   If you got rid of all the attractive people
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.880]   and replaced them with nerds,
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.400]   and then put them in a context
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.040]   where no one understood like basic human emotions.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.320]   So it was like, that was it.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.240]   It was like unattractive nerd survivor, basically.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.200]   But I don't remember them talking about time management.
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.160]   So that's why I was interested in this question
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.360]   is Jeff is saying this is common now,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.000]   which I kind of like.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.240]   They'll ask you in a job interview about time management.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.000]   So Jeff's asking,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.840]   what should he ask his potential interviewees?
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.800]   I have some ideas, but let me just preface this
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.100]   with my core answer here is I don't care.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.400]   Almost no one is good at this.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.220]   And it's not too hard to create a culture
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   or teach people how to have attention centric productivity.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.800]   If people don't listen to my show,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.020]   or I've read like two or three other similar books,
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.240]   they're gonna be terrible at this.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.300]   And I don't think that should be disqualifying to hire them
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.060]   because you're never gonna find someone.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.160]   Or if you do find someone,
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.240]   it's someone who spends too much time
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.600]   listening to productivity podcasts.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.840]   You don't wanna hire them in the first place.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.560]   So I definitely have a mindset of,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.840]   it is your job as an employer to create a culture
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.560]   in which good time management.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.840]   And by that, I really do mean this sort of multi-scale
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.120]   or attention centric productivity is taught.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.980]   Here's how we do it here.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.820]   We respect this is what we want you to do.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.040]   Let me tell you about how I do it.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.120]   So I think this is more easily taught than it is sought out.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.480]   That being said, if I was gonna ask someone
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.800]   for a high level position, let's say,
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.400]   and I cared how much do they think
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.680]   about productivity and time management?
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.580]   I would probably get to the key question.
[00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.080]   On a typical day,
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.040]   how do you decide what to work on next?
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.560]   'Cause that's really gonna sort of cut
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.080]   to the quick a little bit.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.560]   If they don't think at all about organization
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.200]   or time management, then they'll say,
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.760]   well, they'll just think about,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.820]   they'll give some answer about,
[00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.560]   I'll think about in the moment my priorities
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.280]   and try to choose something important.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.000]   If they're a cybernetic productivity type geek,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.780]   they'll go on and on about different tech systems,
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.040]   which is also a warning like, oh man,
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.400]   this guy is gonna be one of those guys
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.740]   who puts a complex little code words
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.800]   in their email subject line to try to simplify the time
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.880]   so you don't have to click on the email to read.
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.040]   Maybe they have these acronyms and brackets in there,
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.760]   you know, like, oh my God, it's gonna be annoying.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.560]   So that's a warning sign too.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.280]   But if they're actually a sort of a Cal Newport type,
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.520]   they might talk about, well, you know,
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.160]   here's how I decide how to spend my time.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.600]   You know, I time block my day
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.120]   and the time block for my day is really,
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.560]   you know, when doing so, I keep tasks over here
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.680]   and I have a weekly plan
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   and here's how I keep on track for the vision
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.800]   and how to make sure I have enough time.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.960]   You'll hear about this sort of
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.400]   attention allocation type decisions.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.520]   You'll hear them talking about,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.880]   well, if I schedule a meeting,
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.260]   I make sure to schedule other time,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.240]   the process, the meeting,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.900]   I wanna give myself time to think.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.920]   So if they're using the lingo of attention
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.520]   as a commodity to be deployed carefully
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.120]   and to be used with respect,
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.080]   if they have some awareness of human psychology
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:31.040]   and human neurology about how slow the mind is
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.400]   to shift context and how it burns out,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.440]   that would be a really good sign.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.840]   If you're really wanting to try to find that,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.240]   you know, in someone,
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.720]   I guess you could ask them that
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.140]   or just make a veiled Cal Newport reference,
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.680]   like one of the geeky things we talk about.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.880]   And if they know what that is,
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.600]   then they're good.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.360]   Then they definitely know this stuff.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.200]   I would say, Jesse,
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.320]   I'm trying to think what the code word would be.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.640]   I think here's the question.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.460]   Here's the question.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.600]   You say, well, let me just one more question.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.760]   Let me ask you before we complete this interview.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   Do you agree that "Name of the Wind"
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.440]   is Brandon Sanderson's best book?
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:16.160]   And if they say, yes, that is Sanderson's best book,
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   then you know, they know us,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:20.640]   and they've listened to us way too long,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.760]   and they're on the ball.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.360]   So that would be my suggestion.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.000]   - That's so good.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.480]   - All right, what do we got next?
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.560]   - All right, next question's from Marie from New York City.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.040]   I work in leadership development
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.020]   for a large healthcare institution.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.000]   I think your ideas on work processes
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.280]   are potentially game-changing
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.800]   for many of the leaders I work with,
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.320]   but I'm struggling with how to share it with them.
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.720]   - This is difficult.
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.600]   It is difficult.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.660]   I have done some of these events before.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.720]   I have worked with C-suite types.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.240]   I've worked with boards of directors.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.320]   I've worked with the executive cores
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.440]   of Fortune 50 companies.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.680]   It's not always my favorite thing
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.300]   because the corporate world is complicated.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.160]   It's more complicated than I understand,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.560]   is often more complicated than my ideas fully appreciate
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.720]   because in addition to just producing work,
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.460]   there's all of these other constraints,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.440]   these social and political constraints of, you know,
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.400]   this division traditionally has had this power,
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.080]   and they gave it up, and this executive VP,
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   and it is a really complicated,
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.340]   it is a complicated world.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.720]   But I will say what seems to help, Mary,
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.960]   more so than particular examples,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.100]   more so than particular tactics,
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.760]   which might seem at first what you need.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.720]   Can I be more specific?
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.200]   Can you give me more specifics?
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.700]   You don't really wanna be specific
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.720]   when talking with leaders
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.800]   because leaders will hear specifics.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.960]   Oh, I used office hours plus shared documents
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.080]   plus whatever, docket clearing meetings.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.680]   You give specifics, and what they hear is,
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.160]   where is there a problem with this?
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.940]   Where is there a potential danger with this?
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.680]   Where might this ruffle someone's feathers
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.520]   or get me in trouble?
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.560]   It is always easier not to do something new.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.280]   Something new introduces the possibility of problems.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:14.320]   So I always say with leaders, we're very aware,
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.240]   if I don't wanna do something
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.580]   that's gonna create new problems,
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.760]   you wanna get the core principles.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.560]   And I think the core principles you wanna get to
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.000]   when you're talking to a leader
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.120]   is to push them away
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.640]   from a cybernetic definition of productivity,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.900]   get them away from what IT system can we buy
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.000]   that's gonna generate more analytic insights from our data
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.160]   and ensure that we get data sharing
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.800]   at a higher velocity of information accessibility.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.820]   Get them away from that.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.840]   They love that world because there's vendors
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.080]   and you spend money and they have slick slideshows,
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.120]   you feel like you're doing something.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.560]   You gotta say that doesn't really matter.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.800]   Yeah, you can speed stuff up, have more information, great,
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.700]   but this is who cares.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.040]   What matters is the brain.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.420]   The human brain can only focus on one thing at a time
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.200]   and needs relatively long refactoring periods
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.420]   to switch from one target to another.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.840]   This is what we should care about.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.000]   We have a bunch of human brains,
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.880]   we wanna think about things and produce value,
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.440]   they need time to do it.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.240]   They need the ability to do things one at a time.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.700]   And once we realize that, I would say,
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.240]   we then realize that context shifts
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:23.040]   are like productivity poison.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.520]   That's the thing we're trying to minimize.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.000]   We don't need IT systems that makes the velocity
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.220]   of information transfer higher
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.960]   or the depth of analytical insights sharper.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.320]   We need less context shifts.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   You want these leaders to be going through their day
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.040]   after talking to you mentally in their mind,
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.840]   keeping a counter of how many times
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.520]   they have to switch my attention to something else
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.600]   and back to something else.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.820]   You want them to slowly become sort of disgusted
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.240]   with the reality that they discover.
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.840]   My God, every time I'm doing this, I can feel it now.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:57.840]   I can almost feel the cerebral sludge that's building up
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.200]   as I keep switching back and forth.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:03.480]   I can see my concentration fading,
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.440]   I can see my energy dissipating.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440]   And then they start to think,
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.040]   okay, so when we think about productivity,
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.440]   what we think about is minimizing doses of this poison.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.040]   Even if this slows us down,
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.620]   even if it introduces friction,
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.200]   even if that executive VP over there
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.240]   that has bad blood with me is gonna get mad about it,
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.800]   even if it is a pain in the moment,
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.760]   now I realize this is what we have to do
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.820]   is stop the context shift.
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.320]   So we have to rethink everything.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.400]   How do we allocate work?
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.320]   How do we talk about work?
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.280]   How do we collaborate?
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.840]   What are our processes for moving information around?
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.120]   We are ready to go through the pain
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:42.120]   of building an attention-centric productivity environment,
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.200]   a workplace that actually respects
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.540]   how the human brain functions.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.560]   And then they can come up with the very specific things
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.520]   that make sense for their work, for their tools,
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.520]   for the people they work with.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.440]   Then they can figure that out.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.280]   So anyways, Murray,
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.840]   that's what I've increasingly come to realize.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.480]   Forget examples and get the principles.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.440]   Because if they're a leader at a big company
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.980]   or a large healthcare institution, they're smart.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.320]   They're very smart.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.440]   They notice the issues.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.880]   They know what's not working.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.200]   They can understand deep principles.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.600]   They can generate tactics out of it.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   So anyways, I've been big about that recently.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.220]   The weeds are too messy in corporate America.
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.240]   It's why I don't go around and try to consult for companies
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.720]   and say, "Let me help you rebuild
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.120]   "your communication protocols," or something like this.
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.160]   Because the weeds are so thick and bespoke,
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.960]   and every company has their own very specific issues.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.000]   And it's very difficult for an outsider to move through.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.340]   And an outsider can only do so much anyways.
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.480]   You need the people right there
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.000]   that are stuck in these weeds to recognize
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.560]   that a better plant needs to grow there.
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.720]   You need them to realize what the problem is.
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.620]   And then they can generate the solutions.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.720]   They know more about their company than I do.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.600]   They know more about their group
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.280]   than a leadership development executive does.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.840]   So the best thing we can do is teach them what the issue is
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.100]   and then let them actually come up with problems.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.120]   - That was a good analogy with the plant.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.340]   - Plants and weeds, yeah.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:03.500]   You know, I could do that, Jesse.
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.620]   I could be.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:08.300]   This is my problem, is I'll write about
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   all the stuff I write about since 2015, basically.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.220]   Everything I write about it, in some ways,
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:17.680]   about technology intersecting
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.040]   with different parts of our life.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   So technology intersecting with work, of course,
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:21.880]   is a big thing.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.920]   All this productivity talk is about work
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.860]   in an age of digital distraction
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.120]   and high velocity cybernetic productivity notions.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.400]   It's all about technology intersecting work.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.100]   Digital minimalism is about technology
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.140]   intersecting our personal lives.
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.940]   This is what I care about, right?
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.680]   But the issue is I'll deal with a particular topic
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.780]   and I'll think about it deeply and produce some big ideas.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.680]   And then I move on.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.400]   But the problem is the ideas are still out there.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.080]   So, you know, Deep Work had a bunch of ideas
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.520]   that I thought were very important.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.700]   But then I went on and wrote a bunch of other books.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.680]   And yet there's a lot of people who say,
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.860]   well, can't you just come and help us do Deep Work?
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.700]   That's the issue.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.620]   It's not my instinct of let me just stick with a topic
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.040]   and really keep pushing it and promoting it.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.080]   I like the idea.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.340]   I wanna understand.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.680]   I get the pleasure out of understanding something new.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.080]   And by the time people are catching on with something,
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.420]   a lot of times I've moved on to sort of the next topic
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.260]   I'm trying to understand.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.340]   So this is why I don't travel the world,
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.800]   you know, running workshops.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.140]   This is probably pretty lucrative actually,
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.720]   but running workshops about, you know,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.920]   how to make your team deeper, building processes.
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.760]   I don't know, just actually,
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.580]   we could probably make a lot of money.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:29.980]   Maybe you and I should just fly around the world
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.160]   and have people cancel their Slack accounts
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.720]   and do office hours, clear meetings.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.640]   We could wear suits.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.200]   - But then you wouldn't be able to read books in the woods
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.040]   like you're doing right now.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.740]   So that wouldn't be as fun. - Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.580]   Yeah, that's the problem.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.680]   Here's what we'll do like in Goodwill Hunting
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.920]   when Ben Affleck went to the meeting with the NSA
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.880]   instead of Matt Damon,
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.480]   I'm gonna send you and you're gonna give like
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.900]   very bombastic speeches on my behalf
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.060]   that like involve for whatever reason,
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.560]   like a lot of sort of onstage flexing and weightlifting.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.740]   I don't know why, I just think this would be great.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.220]   Just to mystify people,
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   just to have you run out and be like,
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.060]   focus is like-- - The correct form
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.960]   to deadlift is this.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.800]   - Exactly.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   Now I don't know why I would want you
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.640]   having doing deadlifts.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.240]   I just have this vision of you in like gym pants
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.720]   and like a muscle shirt.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.800]   Like, okay, deep work is like lifting heavy weights.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.520]   Every rep.
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.080]   - I can't even lift that heavy weights.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:27.920]   - No, I know.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.340]   And it's not like this is something you do.
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.520]   I just thought it'd be funny.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.240]   I'm just thinking like what the opposite would be.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.380]   And then to flip it around,
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.680]   then you should have me take over some of your coaching,
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.480]   sports coaching responsibilities.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.960]   And then I would just be terrible at that.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.520]   And I'd be like, well, the lacrosse ball,
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.380]   we have to think about it like an idea
[00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   that is evolving through a network of competing ideas.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.080]   And then so is it really, are you catching the ball
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.340]   or is it an idea that we're formulating?
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:02.020]   And so that's what we'll do.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.160]   I'm actually going to an event right after this.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.520]   This is why I'm wearing a nicer shirt
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.080]   is right after we get off the air here,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.500]   I'm going over to the Rockefeller Center,
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.640]   which is the School of Public Policy
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.080]   and Social Sciences here at Dartmouth.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.040]   And I'm doing a fireside chat.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.000]   I'm going to sit in a chair
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.080]   and be interviewed by another professor.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.640]   In theory for an audience, we'll see.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.400]   - That's cool.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.640]   You had the fireside chats in your courses back in the day.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.440]   I took those before I even knew you.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.120]   - Didn't, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.200]   Scott and I, Scott Young and I had fireside chats.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.440]   Was this in--
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.620]   - You can hear the fire crackling in the background.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.420]   - Yeah, so the VAT put in the fire crackling sound?
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.260]   - Yeah.
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.500]   - That's great, I love it, I love it.
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   Yeah, yeah, we did these fireside chats.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.220]   So this would have been for, was it Life of Focus?
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.500]   - I think it was Focus, yeah.
[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:57.100]   - Yeah, yeah, so we did these fireside chats
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.780]   where we would talk about what had happened
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:00.820]   in that week of the course.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.740]   And then yeah, shout out to VAT,
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.020]   Scott's longtime producer, I think added fire sounds.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.660]   I'm actually talking to Scott, I think tomorrow, so.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.060]   How much, all right, anyway, speaking of,
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.780]   I have to do an event, let's keep rolling here
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.120]   because I'm about to go on stage.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.120]   All right, so let's get to another question.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.340]   - All right, next question's from Ben.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.700]   You seem to have a strong ability
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.420]   to break down phenomena around you
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.920]   into systems and processes.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.900]   How much of this is a systematic approach
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.860]   on your part versus intuition?
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.640]   - Well, Ben, that's all training.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.260]   I have been thinking about things in terms of systems.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.700]   So breaking down behaviors or goals or hidden processes,
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.300]   breaking down and clarifying them,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:45.940]   and then using that clarification
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.540]   to either better understand or direct your decisions in life.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.340]   I was doing this at a very unusually young age.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.660]   I mean, I guess college is when I did my first sort of,
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.080]   early in college, my first paid writing.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.740]   There's a piece I did, and God, I don't know where this is,
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.620]   but I remember including this piece as a writing sample
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.740]   for my agent.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.020]   At the time, I was trying to convince her
[00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.820]   to represent me for my first book, "How to Win at College."
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.260]   And I was 20.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.540]   She's like, "Okay, I need writing samples.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.700]   I don't know if you can even write."
[00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:20.380]   And I remember one of the articles I had written
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.740]   when I was 19 or 18, I forgot where I published it,
[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.060]   but I remember the title was
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:28.720]   the ABCs of something productivity.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.220]   And I'd broken it down into ABC or whatever.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.340]   So anyways, I always thought that way
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.920]   because as a teenager, I read a lot of self-help,
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.140]   I read a lot of time management,
[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.780]   I read a lot of pragmatic nonfiction
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.840]   and business advice books.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.020]   I read all these books
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.260]   because I had my dot-com company back then.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:46.640]   And so during that formative part of my brain's development,
[00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:50.900]   it developed listening to David Allen recordings,
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.380]   listening to business books,
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:56.100]   listening to the 1990s era
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.020]   of New York-based big idea writers
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.900]   like Malcolm Gladwell and Stephen Johnson and Clive Thompson.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.460]   And so I just, I grew up, my brain developed around that
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.800]   and I spent my entire life doing it.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.980]   So that also, that comes easier for me.
[00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.300]   I like to think of myself as the Bryce Harper
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.980]   of coming up with systems in the sense that,
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.980]   Bryce Harper was a precociously young hitter.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.800]   He spent his entire childhood hitting.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.460]   I spent my entire childhood doing something
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.380]   that turned out to be multiple orders
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.940]   of magnitude less lucrative,
[00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.060]   which was coming up with ideas.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.980]   And there's no $330 million contract for idea writing.
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.380]   But anyway, so Bend-S practice.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.060]   If you do more of it, you get better,
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.400]   but it's sort of a parlor trick.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.540]   And it's good to recognize this type of writing
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:41.380]   when you see it.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.200]   I don't know how important it is
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.180]   for other people to develop it though.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:45.700]   It's, I don't know.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:47.820]   It's its own thing, Jesse.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:52.060]   I can, in any situation, I can come up with a theory
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.260]   or system about what's happening,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.880]   about some sort of dynamic that's kind of interesting.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.620]   And 90% of the time it's empty underneath,
[00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.180]   but I can come up with something in the moment
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.260]   that sounds good.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.180]   - Yeah, you give everything really good names still.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.900]   - I know, it's what I do.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:11.340]   Again, it's like Bryce Harper, but a lot less lucrative.
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:16.660]   All right, let's do one more question.
[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.740]   - All right, next question is from Clemens from Vancouver.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.320]   "I'm a big fan of the philosophy
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.280]   "behind your productivity system,
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.180]   "especially time blocking.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.860]   "Where I'm struggling is to incorporate
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.320]   "your role-based task boards into my approach.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.360]   "As a manager, what's important to me
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.900]   "is often time sensitive of something.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.020]   "How should I build my task boards?"
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.560]   - All right, so, I mean, Clemens,
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.460]   I know that time sensitivity is this urgent
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.300]   or is it not urgent.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.880]   I know that that is important,
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:48.140]   and you can capture that in your task boards,
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.820]   but you can tackle that at a smaller scope.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.760]   So my argument with my various attention-centric
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.520]   productivity ideas, one of the ideas about tasks
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.860]   are that you should organize like tasks in the same place.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.080]   And I think role is the right way to organize it,
[00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.060]   not sensitivity.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.700]   So you should have a task board for different roles
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.380]   or major projects, for example.
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.460]   Now what this means can be different depending on your job,
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:18.700]   but it's content specific.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:23.100]   The content is similar of the tasks of the same board.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.860]   The reason why that's similar is because
[00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.880]   when we think about a particular role of this type
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:32.360]   where all the tasks you're seeing all sort of
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.320]   are involving the same type of activities or information
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.800]   or the same type of project,
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.360]   that means everything you're looking at
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.920]   is pulling from the same semantic context inside your brain.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.560]   And that is much more easy to work with.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.640]   It's much easier to work with.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.720]   So if I confront, okay, here's a board
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.020]   of all the stuff related to my teaching,
[00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:54.920]   I can now have my mind load up the teaching networks,
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.260]   thinking about courses and my students
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.340]   and what needs to be done.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:00.000]   And once it's loaded up that network,
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.680]   I can now work with all the stuff on this board
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.900]   and think about it and organize it and work on it
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.740]   and tackle some things.
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.240]   That's all gonna come relatively easily
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.540]   because I have the right,
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:09.900]   I mean the same cognitive context
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.740]   as I move from task to task.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.180]   If I instead tried to organize my tasks
[00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.240]   by let's say time sensitivity,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.960]   so now I have a board of here's everything
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.620]   that is due in a week versus due in a month,
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.060]   the content of these tasks could vary wildly.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.720]   So now it's much harder for my brain to deal with
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:29.240]   because here is a task about teaching,
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.300]   here's a task about research,
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.860]   here's a task about an upcoming trip.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.060]   Those are all completely semantically separate context
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.000]   and it's gonna be much harder for my brain
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.180]   to make use of that.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.780]   So what I suggest is organizing your tasks
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.300]   by similar content.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.560]   Then within each of these boards,
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.540]   you can organize by time sensitivity.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.020]   And you can say, this is due this week,
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:47.960]   what I'm working on this week,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:49.660]   what I need to think about coming up for the next week.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:51.700]   You can organize them that way.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.940]   And so when you're trying to figure out then,
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.300]   you're doing weekly planning
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.380]   and you're looking at your task boards,
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.740]   what do I need to make time on?
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.420]   Okay, so you're gonna have multiple boards
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:03.060]   that maybe each have urgent stuff on it.
[00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.520]   That's fine.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.360]   All right, you have multiple boards
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.200]   with urgent stuff on it.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.140]   You can look at them all and figure out,
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.020]   right, here's the things I'm working on this week.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.100]   That's not that big of a deal.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.380]   But anyways, that's why I organize,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.060]   my main level of organization is content.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.540]   And then I organize within the content.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:18.900]   It's all about setting up a context
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.820]   that your brain can work with more easily.
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.100]   You know what, Jesse, we have one more question here.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:24.940]   I'm gonna answer fast.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:25.760]   Let's just do it.
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.100]   Let's do the last question.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.060]   I'm feeling fast.
[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.020]   - Yeah, I'm actually excited
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.420]   'cause I wanted to hear your riff on this.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.060]   All right, it's from Jeremy.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:35.860]   I'm a legislative consultant,
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:37.380]   so deep work and distractions
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.500]   are both key elements of my job.
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.460]   My time is consumed by entertaining,
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.420]   attending, and preparing for meetings,
[00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:45.340]   tracking legislation and current events,
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:48.700]   and conducting borderline admin tasks.
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.020]   I currently am finding it difficult
[00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.340]   to find time for deep work,
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.620]   such as learning and writing about policy ideas,
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:56.620]   studying legislative history.
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.180]   How would you go about balancing distractions and deep work?
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:04.040]   - Well, Jeremy, I would say you're a consultant.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.620]   I think you're probably a solo entrepreneur here,
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:09.100]   based on the context of this question.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.060]   It's just you run your own consultancy.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.600]   You don't work for a big firm.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.220]   First two hours of every day, deep work.
[00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:16.060]   That's it.
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:18.420]   Work backwards from that.
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.680]   Not that hard to work backwards from.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.580]   It means, okay, I don't schedule meetings before noon
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:24.700]   because I want to make sure that I have at least an hour
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.000]   to prep for a meeting or travel to a meeting if needed.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.020]   I might have to move a meeting
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.820]   or an opportunity to the next week
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:34.940]   because I only have so many slots
[00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:37.740]   when the morning's not free, and whatever.
[00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.460]   That'll take you a month to get used to.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.620]   You'll have maybe 10% of the people you deal with
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.900]   will have some friction because of this,
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.380]   and then they'll get over it,
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.580]   and you only have to think about it again.
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:48.140]   Two hours every morning,
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:51.440]   focused on learning new skills, developing your business.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.600]   It's that simple.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.360]   I think sometimes what happens is,
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.760]   is we get worried about some of the small issues
[00:55:56.760 --> 00:55:58.880]   that will arise, most of those being temporary,
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.960]   and we let the fear of those small issues
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.420]   keep us in a state that is incredibly worse.
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.800]   We're willing to trade.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.800]   This client might be annoyed,
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:10.800]   and I might not be able to work with that person
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.720]   because they only like to work in the meetings.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.560]   That might happen in the next three weeks.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.040]   You're willing to trade that for,
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.000]   over the next few years, my business stagnates.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.480]   My ability to master this new piece of legislation,
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.760]   which could bring in hundreds of thousands
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.880]   of new business, goes away.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.240]   And when you actually see those trade-offs,
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.400]   this is crazy.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.160]   I annoy this person, I don't work with that person anymore.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.280]   Of course I'll make that trade for all these benefits
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.400]   of being able to systematically work deeply on what matters,
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.480]   but in the moment, we just see the short-term pain.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.720]   So I'm gonna suggest something like that.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.600]   It doesn't have to be exactly that,
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.720]   but honestly, that's the easiest thing.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.900]   Start your workday a little early.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.620]   Do 8.30 to 10.30.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.600]   Deep work with a ritual.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.160]   You get the right coffee, you go to a place.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.240]   There's no email 'til that's done.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.680]   And I'm telling you, it'll take about a month
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.720]   for you to adjust your habits, make that tractable.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.160]   It'll take about a month before your clients
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.680]   get used to that, and then everyone will be fine with it.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.840]   And your trajectory, the compound interest
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.400]   of what you're gonna be able to grow to and accomplish
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.500]   is just going to exponentially turn upwards.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.700]   Two hours every morning.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:12.040]   All right.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.320]   All right, so that's it for questions.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.720]   I wanna move on to the final segment of the show.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.400]   It's where we talk about something interesting
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.200]   that you, my listeners, sent in to my interesting
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.040]   at calnewport.com email address.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.680]   Before we do, let me briefly talk about
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   another one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.740]   That's our good friends at Blinkist.
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.680]   The Blinkist app allows you to understand
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.560]   the most important points from over 5,500
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.680]   non-fiction books and podcasts.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:43.280]   It offers you these short summaries called Blinks.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.920]   That you can either read or listen to
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.800]   while you do other things.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.560]   They take about 15 minutes.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:52.040]   So in about 15 minutes, you can get the main points
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   from thousands of popular non-fiction books.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.640]   Now, the way that I recommend using this,
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.020]   the way I use it, the way Jesse uses it,
[00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:06.440]   is as a triage service for your reading habit.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.760]   You hear about a book, you're thinking,
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.240]   should I buy this and add it to my list?
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.960]   Go listen or read the Blink first.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.880]   That almost always will tell you,
[00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.520]   oh yes, yes, yes, this will be great.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.320]   I really wanna learn more about these points.
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.520]   Or, this isn't what I thought it was.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.800]   Or it is what I thought it was,
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.600]   but honestly, the Blink was all I needed to know.
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.720]   I don't think I wanna spend 250 pages with this.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.360]   So it's a triage service that makes sure
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.760]   that the books you actually buy and try to read
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.480]   are books that you know you're really going to like.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:37.600]   This in turn, not only makes the most of your reading time,
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.860]   but helps you become a more serious reader.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:43.960]   Because your experience with these books is positive.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.940]   You're able to figure out ahead what you wanna read.
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.680]   The side benefit of this is as you're reading Blinks
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.720]   for books that you don't end up buying,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.160]   you are still getting useful information.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.600]   So let's say your hit rate is one book out of every four.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.080]   One book out of every four that you read
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.600]   or listen to the Blink to, you buy that book.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.560]   You're still getting four books worth of ideas.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.400]   And one of those books,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:07.440]   you're getting a really deep understanding,
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.000]   but you can draw from the summaries
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.200]   of those other three books
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.720]   to help add context to your understanding.
[00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:16.640]   So it really also helps your grasp of complex ideas.
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.000]   It's again, like an accelerant
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.680]   for how quickly you can master fields.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.920]   'Cause you're not only reading good books,
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.520]   but you're at an even higher rate
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:26.400]   getting key summaries of related books.
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.560]   So if you're a serious reader,
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.740]   and most of my listeners are or aspire to be,
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:35.120]   Blinkist is a great sidekick for that endeavor.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:37.020]   We also wanna mention that there is a
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.680]   temporary service going on right now,
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.560]   a temporary, I guess we'd call it offer
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.000]   called Blinkist Connect
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.880]   that will allow you to share your premium account.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.600]   So you in a sense get two premium accounts
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.440]   for the price of one.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.260]   You can share one with a friend.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.100]   So I think that's cool.
[00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:53.000]   So anyways, right now Blinkist has a special offer
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.960]   just for our audience.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.720]   Go to blinkist.com/deep
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.220]   to start your seven day free trial
[00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.380]   and get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.440]   That's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.720]   Blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.000]   on a seven day free trial.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.780]   Blinkist.com/deep.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.640]   And for a limited time,
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.520]   you can use Blinkist Connect to share your premium account
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.640]   and you will get two premium subscriptions
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.720]   for the price of one.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.320]   We also wanna talk about our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.280]   You need to be using a VPN.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.640]   And if you're gonna use a VPN, it should be ExpressVPN.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.080]   Let me explain what I mean by this.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.280]   What does a VPN do?
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.640]   Well, typically if you connect to the internet,
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.120]   people can see what websites or services you're talking to.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.600]   So if you're connected to a wireless access point,
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.720]   let's say at a Starbucks,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.640]   anyone nearby with the right software
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.520]   can read your packets out of the air and say,
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:54.840]   oh, I see what website Cal is talking to.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.920]   Even if you're at home,
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.880]   connected to the internet through your home,
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.420]   your internet service provider
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.720]   sees which websites you're talking to
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.080]   and they can sell that data.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.920]   And guess what?
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.800]   They often do.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.680]   They use it to profile you and say what types of products
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.160]   it should be served in your direction.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.840]   A VPN allows you to avoid that.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.040]   Here's the way a VPN works.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.280]   If I wanna access a website or a service,
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.480]   I don't directly talk to that website or service.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.520]   I instead talk to a VPN server.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.200]   And I tell that VPN server with an encrypted message
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.480]   that no one listening to me at Starbucks,
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.920]   no one at my internet service provider can read.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.880]   I tell it with an encrypted message,
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.640]   here's who I really wanna talk to.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.280]   And the VPN server talks to that site or service
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   on my behalf, encrypts the response and sends it back to me.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.280]   So now all anyone can see,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.480]   whether they're sniffing your packets
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.600]   or that your internet service providers
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.840]   that you're talking to a VPN.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.080]   They don't know who that VPN is helping you talk to.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.160]   Now ExpressVPN is an industry leader in this technology.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.500]   You install it on your devices,
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.640]   you turn it on with a click
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.360]   and then you use your web browser, your apps,
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.680]   just like you normally would.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.240]   All of this stuff with the encryption
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.080]   and talking to the server,
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.920]   all of that happens in the background.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.200]   You don't even have to worry about it.
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.840]   I like ExpressVPN 'cause the software works well.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:13.680]   It's seamless.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.480]   I like ExpressVPN because they have servers
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.580]   all around the world.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.000]   So wherever you are in the country or the world,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.480]   there's probably a VPN server nearby you can select
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.320]   to connect to, which means you'll have a very fast connection
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.080]   and they have good bandwidth for these servers as well.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.400]   So you're not even gonna know you're using a VPN,
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.500]   but you get all those privacy advantages.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.000]   So stop allowing anyone who wants to,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.900]   to monitor your internet use.
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.200]   Secure your internet today with the VPN
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.080]   I trust for online protection, which is ExpressVPN.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.320]   So visit expressvpn.com/deep
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.360]   and they will give you three extra months free.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:55.360]   So that's expressvpn.com/deep, expressvpn.com/deep.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.880]   Don't forget the slash deep
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.720]   to get that three extra months free.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.080]   All right, let's do something interesting, Jesse.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.800]   Now, typically in the studio,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.400]   I'd be able to pull this up on a screen.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.520]   Can't do that from here.
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.160]   Though I'll figure out how to do that going forward.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.960]   We're tricking out the HQ North for the rest of the summer.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:15.800]   So don't worry.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.640]   Soon I'll be able to pull up an article,
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.600]   but for now I'm just gonna read the article.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.080]   I have it here in front of me.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.760]   I will say, I was telling Jesse about this earlier offline.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:29.240]   There is some studios at Dartmouth that I can rent.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.600]   Now, they're not really,
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.520]   the one I have in mind is not for podcasting.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.360]   It's really for doing like book on tape audio recording.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.960]   It's a room where every surface is sound baffles.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.000]   But what I'm thinking about doing
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.280]   is bringing in a ring light and a nice camera
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.880]   and just setting it up on there
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.920]   and using that for podcasts,
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.240]   completely soundproof darkened room.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.080]   Could be really cool.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.640]   So I'm gonna check that out when I,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.200]   I'm gonna check that out soon.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.040]   It'd be great.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.080]   - That's so good.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.080]   - They also have a podcast studio,
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.520]   but it's not for video podcast.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.600]   It has all the equipment you need for normal podcasting,
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   but that might look okay in there.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.760]   So I'm gonna check that out too.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.240]   So anyways, I have a lot of ideas for,
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.960]   our tech is gonna grow as I get increasingly bored.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.880]   (laughs)
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.720]   Up North.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.000]   Anyways, this is all to say,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.880]   I can't show you the article I'm reading today,
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.480]   but I will tell you about it.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.080]   And there's a link in the show notes.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:23.000]   This is an article from the Hollywood Reporter from June.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:23.960]   It's a recent article.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.560]   The title is,
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.560]   Taylor Sheridan does whatever he wants.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.520]   So Taylor Sheridan, if you don't know,
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.960]   was the broke actor turned screenwriter,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.640]   turned television hit maker.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.760]   He is the showrunner and head writer
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.160]   behind a lot of hit shows,
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.840]   including most notably Yellowstone.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.000]   He's also written,
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.640]   he has this great trilogy,
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.880]   Sicario, Wind River.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.720]   I forgot the other one.
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:53.680]   He has a good movie trilogy
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.240]   of these sort of modern gritty Westerns,
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.040]   Kings of Providence,
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.560]   1923, a Yellowstone prequel,
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.240]   1883, a Yellowstone prequel.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.480]   He's doing all these sorts of shows.
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.080]   And so there's this big profile about Taylor Sheridan
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.800]   that's in the Hollywood Reporter.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.600]   Now I'll tell you an interesting thing
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.000]   before I get to the quote I wanna read.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.360]   An interesting thing I learned in this profile
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:21.360]   is this giant ranch in Texas came up for sale.
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.120]   So just so we understand Taylor Sheridan's work habits.
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.840]   A giant ranch, the Four Sixes Ranch in Texas.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.320]   As a native Texan myself,
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.240]   I have heard of the Four Sixes.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.040]   It's over kind of West near the Panhandle.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.640]   It's roughly the size of Los Angeles.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.320]   It's 300,000 acres or something like that.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.360]   Some huge amount, some huge amount of land.
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.160]   Anyways, it came up for sale.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.240]   It came up for sale.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.520]   And Taylor, he lived on a ranch,
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.880]   a small ranch of, you know, a thousand acres.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.120]   It came for sale.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.000]   And Taylor really wanted to buy this ranch.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.440]   So he said, it's famous, right?
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.360]   He's like, this will be great.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.520]   It's the most famous ranch in Texas.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.640]   Well, the King Ranch is more famous.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.120]   It was this famous old ranch.
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.920]   He said, how much is it gonna be?
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.960]   And they said $350 million.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.200]   And so Taylor was like, I'm $330 million short,
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.000]   but hold on, hold on, just like don't sell it yet.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.320]   And he goes around, because his shows are very successful,
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   and he signs a $200 million deal with Paramount
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.920]   for like doing all these sorts of shows.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.000]   And basically between that deal
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.760]   and bringing in a couple of minority investors,
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.880]   they bought this ranch.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.720]   So he's now writing out of his mind,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.120]   just writing out of his mind,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.640]   because he wanted this ranch.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.320]   So he's writing, you know, four shows or something crazy.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.600]   Not very slow productivity of him.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.360]   Anyways, how is he doing this?
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.280]   So this brings us up to the quote I liked.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.160]   This is from the article.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.920]   Sheridan often writes in a one room cabinet
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.280]   he built in Wyoming.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.680]   He's always a fast writer, he says,
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.880]   but after building this script generating isolation bunker,
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.320]   he was suddenly able to grind out episodes
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.680]   of hit TV shows at a phenomenal speed.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.400]   I've written many episodes in eight to 10 hours, he claims.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.120]   So I like this idea that like, okay,
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.000]   now he has to write four shows or something
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.440]   so he can afford this ranch.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.360]   And so he built a bunker and built his whole life
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.720]   around just writing shows and it really worked.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.200]   And so when we hear Taylor's story,
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.520]   we say, well, that's exhausting, all the different,
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.800]   he's so busy that he has to do this
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:26.960]   to even keep up with the work.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.320]   But the takeaway I had is, you know,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.800]   imagine if you had the isolation bunker
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.720]   and you didn't have to pay off a $350 million ranch.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.920]   And you were just doing a normal type of,
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.240]   you're writing a book a year or like one television show.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.720]   You'd spend two weeks and you'd be done.
[01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:49.000]   I mean, I'm just thinking about the degree to which
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.120]   we often let time scarcity and busyness
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:56.000]   push us into the way we work,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.800]   but we never think about taking the things
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.520]   that really help us work,
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.640]   to help us deep to sort of emergency measures.
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.080]   And if we made that sort of core,
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.480]   we could actually have a lot more time.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.880]   So anyways, I just love this thought experiment
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.800]   of Taylor Sheridan without the $350 million ranch,
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.600]   but with the isolation writing bunker in Wyoming,
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.600]   could go up there for a month
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   and finish an episode of a show
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.720]   and then spend the other 11 months on his much smaller,
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.920]   but still serviceable ranch.
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.800]   So anyways, we see in extreme situations,
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:29.520]   the ability to produce great work
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:30.760]   through extreme concentration.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.520]   And I just wish we had more examples of that
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.000]   in non-extreme situations,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.400]   more examples of that in a slow productivity context of,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.160]   I just do this thing all out.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.920]   And then when I'm done, I'm done and I rest.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.560]   And so there's some inspiration to pull out of there.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.760]   There's a lot of stress coming out of this article,
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.280]   but there's some inspiration to pull out of there,
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.240]   pull out of there as well.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.320]   Jesse, I think we need a deep work ranch, by the way.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.160]   This is my new.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.880]   (Jesse laughs)
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.780]   - You're pretty much in one right now.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:01.000]   - Well, okay, this is a good point.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.040]   So the house I'm in now is,
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.120]   it's in town in Hanover, it's on the pond up here.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.160]   But my brother-in-law who's staying up in Vermont
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   this summer sent me a link for a property nearby.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.680]   It's in Vermont, near here, I don't know.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.640]   I don't know the geography well, 120 acres
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   and a couple outbuildings, some barns, some agricultural land
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.160]   and there's a creek and a bond and the whole thing kind of,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.280]   at the end of it, I think there's the property
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.960]   goes all the way down, has frontage on Fairleigh Lake,
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:33.480]   Fairleigh Lake or whatever.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.600]   And he was like, yeah, this could be like a pizza restaurant
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.080]   because there's this big pizza oven there.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.960]   And like, we could build a deep work cabin.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.520]   It's like, yes, that's what we need.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.720]   We need this deep work north.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.040]   I guess it's not a ranch in New England.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.400]   I don't know what you would call it,
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.000]   a ramble or something like that.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:48.960]   That's what we need.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.020]   - 120 acres is a lot of upkeep.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.880]   - Well, I didn't wanna broach the topic now,
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.320]   but I was assuming you could take care of that.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.900]   (Jesse laughs)
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.680]   Run the tractor.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.760]   - I'd be more inclined to like rent something
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.120]   from somebody who has 120 acre ranch.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.160]   - See, this is smarter.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.000]   This is smarter.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.080]   Okay, so what we need is a deep work fan with 120 acres.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.440]   He was like not often there.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.640]   Okay, that's gonna be the new idea.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:19.480]   All right.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.920]   - But you pretty much have that scenario right now,
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.000]   this summer, so you should, that's gonna be sweet.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.040]   - No, it's true, we do, because down the road from here
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.960]   is the golf course, but they canceled the golf team
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.600]   and closed the golf course at Dartmouth.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.320]   But the golf course is still there.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.000]   So they've just temporarily just call it a park
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.680]   and they're still mowing it and everything.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.240]   So there's right down the street is 18 holes
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.040]   worth of golf course that you can just,
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.120]   it's just a giant park.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.320]   And then it's surrounded by woods that have kilometers
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.160]   and kilometers of cross country and running trails.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.560]   So yeah, you're kind of right.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.140]   It's like I have the deep work ranch,
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.040]   but I don't have to upkeep it.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.000]   And also a lot of random people invest
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.040]   or walk in their dogs on it, but that's okay.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.520]   I think it's a fair trade.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.960]   - It's like St. Andrews on a Sunday.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.800]   - Yep, exactly.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.480]   - The old course, they all walk their dogs on that course.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.440]   - All right, well, anyway, speaking of,
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.720]   I don't know, walking places, I'm about to be on stage.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.360]   I'm supposed to be on stage in like 10 minutes.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.440]   So I gotta go.
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.760]   Thank you everyone for listening.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.840]   We'll be back next week, probably in the standard
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.600]   Deep Work HQ as I temporarily am coming back to visit DC.
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.880]   So hopefully I will be seeing you all
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.920]   sort of in the old studio next week.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.720]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.860]   (upbeat music)
