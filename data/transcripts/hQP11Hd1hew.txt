[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   If I were to take the premise of your question,
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.120]   well, like why were things disappointing
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.160]   in terms of the real world impact?
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.880]   And my answer would be reliability.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.880]   If somehow it ends up being the case that
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.560]   you really want them to be reliable
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.080]   and they ended up not being reliable,
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.320]   or if reliability turned out to be harder than we expect,
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.960]   I really don't think that will be the case,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.280]   but if I had to pick one,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.880]   if I had to pick one and you tell me like,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   hey, like why didn't things work out?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.600]   It would be reliability,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.680]   that you still have to look over the answers
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.640]   and double check everything.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.680]   That's just really puts a damper on the economic failure
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.160]   that can be produced by those systems.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.680]   - And they'll be technologically mature.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.360]   It's just a question of whether they'll be reliable enough.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   - Yeah, in some sense,
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.080]   not reliable means not technologically mature,
