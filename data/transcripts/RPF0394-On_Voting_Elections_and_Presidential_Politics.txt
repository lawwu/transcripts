[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The holidays start here at Ralph's with a variety of options to celebrate traditions old and new.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.540]   Whether you're making a traditional roasted turkey or spicy turkey tacos, your go-to shrimp cocktail, or your first Cajun risotto,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.760]   Ralph's has all the freshest ingredients to embrace your traditions. Ralph's fresh for everyone.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.000]   We've locked in low prices to help you save big storewide.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.460]   Look for the locked in low prices tags and enjoy extra savings throughout the store. Ralph's fresh for everyone.
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460]   [Music]
[00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.700]   Radicals, I've just found some important news and I've got to get this to you as fast as possible because I just found out that
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.460]   there's a presidential election tomorrow, November 8, 2016.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.320]   There is a presidential election in the United States of America and your life is going to be over if the wrong person wins.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.820]   You're doomed if the wrong person wins that election tomorrow.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.400]   You are absolutely going to be without a future.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.900]   And so I've got to get you all the information that you need.
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.980]   I need to fill you in on all of the details so that you know who you can vote for and how you can vote.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.540]   Because if you don't go out and vote tomorrow, the end of the world as we know it is upon us and...
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.620]   [Music]
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.620]   Oh, wait a second. Sorry, wrong show.
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620]   [Music]
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.620]   [Laughter]
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.620]   This isn't that show. This is another show.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.620]   [Music]
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.620]   [Music]
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620]   [Music]
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.780]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.920]   Generally not quite as caffeinated as that intro.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.420]   This is the show where we tackle the subject of financial freedom,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.580]   building a plan for financial freedom, while also living a rich and meaningful life now.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.080]   And today we talk about voting, elections and their impact on your money and your life.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.860]   And no, I hope you like my little joke, but I promise,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.380]   none of that nonsense around here today.
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.380]   [Music]
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.380]   In case you haven't heard, and it's hard for me to imagine how you wouldn't have heard,
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.380]   although, I tell you what, if you didn't know, and you're listening to this,
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.380]   if you didn't know, listen to it currently, that tomorrow, November 8, 2016, is the 2016 presidential election,
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:17.380]   I would applaud your ability to be informed about things that matter to your life and to ignore everything else.
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.380]   I would applaud that. I actually would.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.380]   But I dare say that there's nobody in the listening audience who's not aware of the election tomorrow.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380]   And as has been the case with the last dozens and dozens of elections that I'm aware of,
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380]   this is, of course, the most important election in your lifetime.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.380]   And it will remain that way until November the 9th,
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.380]   in which case the 2020 election campaign for presidential elections will kick off,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.380]   and that again will be the most important election in your lifetime.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.380]   So congratulations, enjoy this one while it lasts, and we can get ready for the next one.
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.380]   Now, lest I offend all of you who do care deeply about the 2016 election,
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   I must tell you that I care about the issues involved in the 2016 election,
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.380]   and I do not say those comments in an effort to minimize the passion that you feel for your position.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380]   I really don't.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.380]   And if you're not ready to hear this yet, then just pause and come back in a few days,
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.380]   because this will be every bit as relevant a couple days after the election as it will be today.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.380]   And if there are those of you who don't like political discussions,
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.380]   I encourage you, this is a good place to use the delete button on your phone.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.380]   And if you do like political discussions, I encourage you to recognize that at no place in today's show
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.380]   will I tell you what to vote for, who to vote for, or even to vote.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.380]   Because my entire point with today's show is to demonstrate to you how.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:52.380]   It's a waste of time for you to devote anything more than maybe an hour
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.380]   to go down and drop a ballot in the box and go back home and get on with your life.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.380]   It's a waste of time for you to pay any attention to this whole debacle any more than that.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380]   And I'll tell you, instead of wasting your time moaning and whining and complaining about this stuff,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.380]   I'm going to give you some activities that you can do that will actually make a difference
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:23.380]   and will be far more influential in your society and in your culture than your vote.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.380]   Now, I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news and to come against the whole cultural conversation.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.380]   It's really annoying.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.380]   I went on YouTube this morning and YouTube tells me I'm supposed to go vote
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.380]   and Facebook tells me I'm supposed to go vote and Google tells me I'm supposed to go vote
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.380]   and can't go anywhere without being known that I'm supposed to go vote.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   They all wanted me to go and vote, and yet, is it really going to matter?
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.380]   Is there a difference that's going to be made in my life depending on who I vote for?
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.380]   Now, if you're screaming "yes" at your earpieces right now, I'd agree with you, yes,
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.380]   there is going to be something of a difference.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.380]   Elections do affect your life to a very small degree,
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.380]   but it's nowhere near as much of a difference as those who are clamoring for you to go out and vote
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.380]   want you to believe that it is.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.380]   It's nowhere near of a difference.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:33.380]   Because I want you to recognize the fact that they need you to go out and vote.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.380]   They need you to feel that it really matters.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   They need you to feel like it's the most important of your election
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.380]   because if you don't feel that way, then you won't pay any attention to them.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.380]   By "them" let me define that.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.380]   I hate when people refer to the "they" without defining them.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.380]   "Them" being politicians.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.380]   They need you for power.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.380]   They need you for their power.
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   They don't have power without you, the collective you, and your collective vote.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   But you, the personal you, the individual you, you don't need them.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   And thus, all of the power is in your hands, not in their hands.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.380]   Yeah, they might have the guns, they might have the government,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.380]   but you've got things that are far more valuable than that.
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.380]   You've got the freedom of choice.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.380]   You've got the freedom of association.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.380]   You've got the freedom of activity.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.380]   You've got the freedom over your own thoughts.
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.380]   And depending on what you do with your life,
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.380]   you will either consistently give away your power to politicians,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.380]   or you'll stand up and take a little bit back for yourself.
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.380]   Today I'm going to give you some ideas for how you can do that.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.380]   And here's the cool thing.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.380]   If you start doing some of these things, I've got 10 ideas,
[00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.380]   if you start doing some of these systematically, consistently,
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.380]   that will have a ripple effect on society.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.380]   And if you care about seeing anything change in society,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.380]   you can't start with them.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.380]   You have to start with you.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.380]   We're going to start with the depressing news,
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.380]   and then we're going to move on towards the hopeful things.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.380]   I always rather end on a hopeful note when I podcast
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.380]   rather than on a depressing note.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.380]   But here's the depressing note.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:52.380]   The 2016 presidential election is reflective of your culture.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.380]   You own it. I own it.
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.380]   If you're frustrated and annoyed at the politicians,
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:13.380]   recognize the fact that you and I collectively chose these politicians.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:19.380]   You and I went through the process of allowing these people to have our attention.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:26.380]   We gave them permission to run their political candidacies.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.380]   We gave them our attention, we gave them our votes,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:36.380]   and collectively we bear the responsibility for them.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.380]   Now, if that's not depressing, I don't know what would depress you.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:47.380]   Because what it means is that everything you don't like
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.380]   about that political candidate,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.380]   all the things that make you despise that person,
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.380]   guess what?
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:04.380]   Those things are what our culture is full of.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.380]   So if it's arrogance,
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.380]   our culture is full of arrogance.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.380]   If it's corruption, guess what?
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:21.380]   We live in a very corrupt culture where people can be bought for not much.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:27.380]   If it's their lack of willingness to deliver anything truthful,
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.380]   we live in a culture that accepts lies on a daily basis,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:36.380]   and we accept it.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.380]   We put them there.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:43.380]   So don't go yelling about the political candidate who you can't stand.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:49.380]   Recognize the fact that you and I are responsible for them.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.380]   Because if you and I hadn't given them power,
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.380]   they wouldn't be there.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   If you and I had stood up and not allowed them to have their place of prominence,
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.380]   they wouldn't be there.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.380]   So it's our fault.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   Pretty depressing, huh?
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.380]   So what can you do?
[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   Because the depressing part is over.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.380]   Now we're going to talk about what you and I can do.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   Remember, we can't do anything about anybody else.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.380]   I can't control you.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.380]   I can't control your actions.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.380]   I can't make you do anything.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.380]   Oh, sure, I could get a gun and come and stick it to your head,
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.380]   but that doesn't work.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.380]   You might carry out the action that I command you,
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.380]   but as soon as the gun is gone,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.380]   you're not going to do it anymore.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.380]   So what can you do?
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.380]   Well, you can change you,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.380]   and I can change me.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.380]   And you can live how you want to live,
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.380]   and I can live how I want to live.
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.380]   And as you do that and I do that,
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   there will be a change and an impact
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:15.380]   on the tiny little community around us.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.380]   And then as dozens of other people do that,
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.380]   there will be a little bit more of a change and an impact
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.380]   on the little community around all of us.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.380]   And then as many more hundreds and thousands
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.380]   and ultimately millions of people do that,
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.380]   there will be a little bit more of a change.
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.380]   Now, of course, some people have more influence than others.
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.380]   At the end of the show, I'll talk to you about that.
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.380]   But without question, there are those who seek to influence
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.380]   many millions, hundreds of millions, and billions of people
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.380]   with their power and with their message.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.380]   And they have very effective ways of doing that.
[00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.380]   But don't start there.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.380]   Don't start with trying to figure out how you can influence
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.380]   millions of people if you can't even influence yourself,
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   or if you can't even influence the one or two people
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:07.380]   who are closest to you.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.380]   There's a good visual metaphor for you and me to keep in mind
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.380]   as we consider the problems of our day.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.380]   It's to recognize that power and influence flow out
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.380]   in a series of concentric circles.
[00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:28.380]   And they're the most influential when they're close.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.380]   I think of it like a stone dropped in the middle of a pond.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.380]   A friend of mine who is a poet, lives in New York City.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.380]   His name is Jonathan Walton.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.380]   He has a poem, and in one stanza of his poem, he has this lyric.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.380]   He does it super fast. I'll do it slower.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.380]   But he says, "We are people pebbles tossed into a pool.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.380]   Every ripple I create in turn ripples you.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.380]   So in unison we are rippling, a type of ripple rhythm,
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:01.380]   but we need to ripple in a way that benefits our living."
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.380]   Again, "We are people pebbles tossed into a pool.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.380]   Every ripple I create in turn ripples you.
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.380]   So in unison we are rippling, a type of ripple rhythm,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:23.380]   but we need to ripple in a way that benefits our living."
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.380]   So if you want to influence others, it has to start with you
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:33.380]   and it has to flow out through those who are the closest to you.
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.380]   So I want to give you some specific and practical ideas,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:40.380]   things that will impact your finances, but that will help you,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.380]   and some things that you can do that will actually be influential.
[00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.380]   So if you're frustrated and angry about the political election,
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.380]   if you're frustrated and angry about who it is that you think is going to win,
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.380]   or who it is who has now won,
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.380]   that's what is, and you can't change that
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.380]   because you have no influence over that.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.380]   But here are some things that you can do.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.380]   Here are some things that you can do and you can focus on in your life.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:17.380]   And the ripples that will come out from some of these things
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:24.380]   will start to build a ripple rhythm with other people around you.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:31.380]   Number one, and probably all-encompassing, is get free yourself.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.380]   My number one suggestion for you, if you would like to be able to
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.380]   have an impact on other people, get out of debt.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:45.380]   And here I'm not making the argument that one course of action
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.380]   is financially superior than another, or that there's no,
[00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.380]   I'm not making any financial argument here.
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.380]   I'm making the argument of freedom.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:04.380]   If you owe other people money, your actions will be governed because of that.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.380]   One of my managing directors, when I was with Northwestern Mutual,
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.380]   used to have the joke, remember he was managing a team of salespeople,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.380]   he always used to say, "I love it when my sales guys go out and buy a brand new car."
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.380]   He said, "I love it. I love it when they go out and buy houses."
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:25.380]   He says, "Because guess what? Payments are good for business."
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.380]   Remember, he, as a managing director, he would get paid
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.380]   based upon the production of his agents, and his agents were all on commission.
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:39.380]   So his happy day was when his agents would pull up into the parking lot
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.380]   in a beautiful new car, or talk about that beautiful new house they bought.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:50.380]   Because now all of a sudden, they got to get busy and make money.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.380]   When you're in debt, when you owe other people money,
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.380]   those other people have control over your actions to some degree.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.380]   Depending on the severity of the debt, depending on the type of the debt, etc.,
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.380]   that degree will vary.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:13.380]   But if you are beholden to other people, your actions will be governed based upon them.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.380]   One of the most valuable financial things that you can do
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.380]   is to get out of debt and stay out of debt.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.380]   Because when you get out of debt and you stay out of debt,
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:34.380]   you'll experience a degree of freedom that you never knew before.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:39.380]   You'll experience a degree of autonomy that you haven't known.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.380]   And what will happen is, even if you could earn more money by being in debt,
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.380]   you'll experience an emotional freedom, and you'll start to see things
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:53.380]   that might matter to you more than money.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.380]   You'll experience the ability to say what you want, to do what you want,
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:05.380]   to be responsible for yourself and for your family.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:10.380]   And that has the potential of turning you into a radical person,
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.380]   has the potential of turning you into the type of person who can stand up
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:21.380]   and speak your mind in the midst of a lot of people who disagree with you.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:27.380]   Number one, if you want to be a revolutionary, if you want to be a radical,
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:33.380]   if you want to see some change, give some serious thought and some serious effort
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:39.380]   to getting out of debt and staying out of debt.
[00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:49.380]   Number two, get off of and get out of governmentally controlled welfare systems.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:59.380]   Disconnect yourself from dependence and reliance on the politicians' good favor towards you.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:08.380]   Recognize that the politicians use money as a way of gaining influence and power.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:14.380]   And they control vast swaths of people based upon the money that they either open up
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:21.380]   to allow to flow from the centralized coffers or upon the money that they cut off.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:27.380]   Doubt me? Just think about the lobbyists that are sent in when the politicians
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.380]   are getting together and thinking about making some kind of legislative change.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.380]   Just think about how if there's a welfare system that's trying to be changed.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:43.380]   Just think about how all of a sudden entire voting blocks can be moved.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:51.380]   If you are reliant on the flow of government funds to you, it's very difficult to be free.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:59.380]   What you'll have a tendency to do is to want to step in and try to change how those funds are used.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.380]   Well, start by getting out of the game.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:14.380]   Make a plan and systematically get off of and out of any kind of governmentally controlled financial system.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:23.380]   Try it. If you doubt me, try it. See how you feel when you're free.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:32.380]   Number three, work to disconnect your income from the large centralized workplace
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:40.380]   and seek to build some sort of more independent and more autonomous form of income.
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:47.380]   If you have opinions and perspectives that are important to you,
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:54.380]   you will find that when you're working within a large centralized system of employment,
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:00.380]   it will be very difficult for you to express those opinions.
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:08.380]   However, if you're responsible for yourself, as in the only people you have to please are your customers,
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:15.380]   you'll have a much higher degree of freedom to express yourself as you want to do it.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:22.380]   It wasn't until a year after I had left Northwestern Mutual that I realized what the freedom was
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:26.380]   of not having to deal with being beholden to an employer.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:32.380]   Because as an employee, I think you have to be responsible with what you say.
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:38.380]   Certainly, you can say what you want in just about any kind of perspective,
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:46.380]   but freedom of speech, simply the first amendment that talks about freedom of speech,
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:52.380]   simply is supposed to protect you from being attacked by the government.
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.380]   It doesn't mean that you're not responsible for what you say.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   And when you're an employee of a large company or you're an employee of somebody who has an opinion
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   different than your own, you will have to muzzle yourself and control what you say.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.380]   It doesn't mean it's not worth doing.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.380]   It doesn't mean you're by definition compromising what you believe.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:24.380]   But if you can disconnect your income from a centralized large company
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:33.380]   with the forces of political correctness scared to appear in a certain way,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.380]   you'll find that will be tremendously valuable to you.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.380]   Now, those three things that I just gave you are absolutely monumental.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:50.380]   I just lumped together action points that are years for some people, years of work to get out of debt,
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.380]   to get off of and out of governmentally controlled and influenced financial systems,
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.380]   and to disconnect your income from a large company and to move in a place where you have more control,
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.380]   where you're more individually responsible.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.380]   Those things are huge and not easy.
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:15.380]   But they'll have a tremendous impact on your life.
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.380]   Now, the rest of my list is a little bit simpler.
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:23.380]   And these are not in order. These are just ideas meant to spark your creative juices.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:29.380]   Number four is build local community and change your purchase decisions and vote with your dollars.
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   Recognize the fact that you are funding the things that you care about,
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   the things that are important to you.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:46.380]   With every purchase decision you make, you are consciously choosing to fund something.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:53.380]   Do some research into the things that you're funding and make sure that you're making those decisions intentionally.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:23:04.380]   Make sure that you are proactive about choosing to do business with people that you want to do business with.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.380]   Don't be scared to stand alone.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.380]   If you want to boycott a certain person or a certain company or a certain practice,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.380]   don't be scared to stand alone. Just because everybody disagrees with you doesn't make you wrong.
[00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.380]   You certainly should pay careful attention to what they say if everyone disagrees with you.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:26.380]   But just because everyone disagrees with you doesn't make you wrong.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:32.380]   You'll sleep well at night if you make conscious decisions to support the things that you care about,
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:38.380]   the things that you believe are right for the reasons that you believe them to be right.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   If you do that in a local community, you'll be able to build relationships with your neighbors.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:54.380]   And your voice in a local community will be far more powerful than your voice to a large multinational corporation.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:06.380]   Your voice to a local politician is far more powerful than your voice to the next president of the United States.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:15.380]   Focus on building local community and use your dollars to fund the things that are valuable to you.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:23.380]   Number five, transition your idea of the word investment so that it includes investing into things that you believe in
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:29.380]   and into people that you believe in.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:36.380]   Invest into things that you believe in and into people you believe in.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   Look at the amount of money that you have under your stewardship.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.380]   Pull out your balance sheet. Look at those numbers.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:51.380]   Look at the amount of money that you have right now under your stewardship and ask yourself,
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:25:01.380]   "Does the way that this money is being managed reflect my values?"
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:11.380]   "Does the way that this money is being managed reflect the type of world that I want to live in?"
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:19.380]   "Does the way that this money is managed reflect the change that I want to see in the world around me?"
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:27.380]   If not, start working on taking small, simple, progressive steps to change
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:39.380]   and invest the money that's under your stewardship into the things, ideas, and people that you believe in.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:48.380]   Number six, show hospitality to your neighbors and build local community where you can actually influence another person.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:55.380]   I'm very concerned personally with the tone that we seem to take in our language with one another,
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:02.380]   especially when speaking in public, when speaking online, and the various forms for communication that we currently use.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.380]   It's vitriol. It's absolutely horrendous.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:14.380]   And I think there is some value to it. I have to be careful with my opinion because I recognize the value of being able to communicate.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.380]   But it's very hard to get people to listen to you when you're just arguing through a keyboard.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:28.380]   I reflect even on some of my own communications online and just wonder sometimes, "Is any of this valuable?"
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   I think some of it is, but I often wonder, "Is any of this valuable?"
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:43.380]   You can argue intensely with somebody online and have nothing fruitful come from it.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:57.380]   But you can sit down and have dinner with your next-door neighbor who's very different from you and have a productive and useful conversation.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.380]   Set up a plan to systematically show hospitality to your neighbors and get to know them, whoever they are.
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.380]   If that means the people in your neighborhood, that would be great.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:11.380]   If that means the neighbors in your community as measured and connected by some other connection,
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.380]   whether an area of social interest, an area of business interest, etc.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:21.380]   Make a plan to invite people over and get to know them.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:28.380]   You may be surprised at the impact that you can actually have with other people if you do that.
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:39.380]   As our world becomes more and more connected, it seems to me that the people in our world become more and more lonely.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:46.380]   I've seen some data that would support that as far as measured sociological data.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   I couldn't prove that statement to you. That just seems to be the case as I look around.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:59.380]   I recognize that as people become more and more connected, we're consistently becoming more and more lonely.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.380]   But you can change that and you can have a huge impact.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:09.380]   Even with something as simple as once a week, spending time with somebody that you don't normally spend time with.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:18.380]   In my family, one of the things we try to do is one night per week, we do our best to have somebody different over into our home.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.380]   One night per week.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   Whether that's somebody that we know from the community or a listener of the show or somebody that we know,
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:31.380]   next door neighbor, co-worker, acquaintance, etc.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.380]   We have it on the calendar. It's there systematically. I have a recurring meeting.
[00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.380]   And it reminds me every week, "Okay, who are we going to invite over this week?"
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.380]   Well, think about it. If you do that, then you're probably not going to do it all 52 weeks.
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.380]   There are times at which you need a break.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:51.380]   But let's just say you have somebody over 40 weeks out of the year.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:29:02.380]   Think about the relationships that could come from spending time and having dinner with 40 or 50 brand new people over the course of a year.
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.380]   Think about the impact.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:16.380]   Think about the conversation you can have that actually matters when you have 3 to 4 hours to visit with somebody over dinner.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   Those of you like me with young families, you might find, as we find, that your dinner invitations generally dry up when you have children.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.380]   Don't worry about it.
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.380]   Just you be the one to give the dinner invitations.
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.380]   You be the one to use your home.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   Invite people over and spend time getting to know them.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.380]   Not with the desire to change them, but just to understand them.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:44.380]   If you don't first understand how somebody thinks and why somebody thinks that way,
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.380]   it's not possible for you to affect their thinking if you even should.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:58.380]   I fear one of the biggest challenges I face, even with communication style and on the show here,
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.380]   trying to figure out how do I accurately represent how somebody else feels.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:09.380]   It's difficult because I don't know who I'm talking to because I've got many thousands of people that I'm talking to.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.380]   That's been really, really challenging for me.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.380]   But you don't need to worry about the thousands of people.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.380]   That's a nut I've got to crack.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.380]   But with one person, you can understand what's important to another person.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.380]   And if you'll systematically show hospitality to your neighbors,
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.380]   what will happen is you start to build local connection, local community,
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   and you'll start to find areas where you can work together with them.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.380]   And instead of everything coming down to which presidential candidate you vote for
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:43.380]   and either they're evil because they're going to vote for candidate A
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.380]   and you're evil because you're going to vote for candidate B,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.380]   all of a sudden you find areas that you can't agree on.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.380]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.380]   I'm not saying that you have to somehow compromise in something that you believe.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:01.380]   But the reality is that in normal, actual human life, normal people,
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.380]   you'll never find somebody else that you agree with.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:15.380]   I'm not advocating for some kind of kumbaya ecumenical acceptance and tolerance of all people.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:21.380]   I'm just saying in normal, natural relationships, human, personal relationships,
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.380]   you can disagree with somebody on all kinds of things,
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.380]   but you can find an area to work together.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.380]   And that's a skill that we need to practice.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.380]   It doesn't come out well in online political conversations,
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:41.380]   but that's a skill that you and I can practice over our dinner tables at home.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:45.380]   Next, number seven, something you can actually do,
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.380]   theme, constant theme here on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.380]   But if you haven't done it, may I strongly encourage you,
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   pull your kids out of the government schools
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:06.380]   and choose a different solution that is appropriate for them
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.380]   and where they are and what they need.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.380]   Pull your kids out.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   See, guess what?
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.380]   You are never going to change the school system.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.380]   Not a bit.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.380]   But you don't have to participate.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.380]   Pull your kids out.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.380]   There would be only a tiny subset of my listeners
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.380]   who would actually disagree with that statement
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:36.380]   because legally by law, they can't pull their kids out.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   And there are solutions there.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.380]   But the vast majority of you, pull your kids out
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:45.380]   and find a solution that's going to work well for them.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.380]   Whether that's home education or private school education
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.380]   or an unschooling approach or whatever it is,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.380]   you are the parent of your children.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.380]   You are responsible for them.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.380]   Your decisions are going to dramatically influence
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:07.380]   and affect the outcome of especially the early years of their life.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.380]   Don't spend time having them locked into a system
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.380]   that somebody else designed for their own purposes, not for yours.
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.380]   Don't waste your child's life having them stuck in a system
[00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:24.380]   that's custom designed for absolutely nobody
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.380]   when you have the resources to pull them out
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.380]   and custom design something for them.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.380]   Talk about politically subversive.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.380]   I've had this show on my to-do list.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.380]   I can never finish my list,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.380]   but I have all these long lists of things I want to talk about.
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:50.380]   There's like 10 politically subversive things that you can do to change the world.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.380]   Number one is pull your kids out of the government schools.
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.380]   Just think about it.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:34:01.380]   Do you go down and trot down to the communist car factory
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.380]   where they say, "Here's a car.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.380]   Everybody's going to drive this car and you're going to like it"?
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.380]   You don't do that.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.380]   Nor do you trot down to the one nationalized brand
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   and choose among the three appropriate models
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.380]   as in we're going to put your kid in the advanced track,
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   the gifted track, the standard track, or the slow kids track.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   You don't buy cars based upon what's being offered to you
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.380]   and the three menu options presented to appear that you have some kind of choice.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:37.380]   You don't go down to the clothing factory where there's men's clothing,
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.380]   women's clothing, boys' clothing, and girls' clothing
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.380]   and just grab whatever is given to you.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.380]   You make a specific customized choice.
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   You choose clothing that's appropriate for you.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.380]   You choose clothing that's appropriate for your children
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.380]   based upon what you want.
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.380]   When you're choosing a job,
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:04.380]   you don't take the job that the local apparatchik assigned you.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.380]   You think about what's right for me.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:13.380]   You go through the process of considering what you should do,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.380]   what's right for you.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.380]   Why should you do anything different for your child?
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.380]   If you want to be politically subversive,
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.380]   if you don't want candidate A or candidate B,
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:30.380]   that person that you can't stand governing your child's indoctrination,
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.380]   don't accept it.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.380]   Get your kids out.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.380]   Choose a different option for their educational track.
[00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.380]   Choose an option that you can control and affect.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.380]   You have no control whatsoever over your local school district,
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.380]   your local government school district.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.380]   But if you come together with a few hundred other parents
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.380]   and you guys establish a private school
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.380]   or you join into a private school that's already established,
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.380]   or you organize a neighborhood co-op,
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:08.380]   or you handle the education of your kids at home,
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.380]   guess what?
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:14.380]   You can have influence there.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   Number eight, if there is a political issue that you care about,
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.380]   why don't you start, instead of arguing about it with other people,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.380]   why don't you start by getting to know other people who disagree with you
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.380]   and educating them on your opinion?
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.380]   Here's my example.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:40.380]   If you're a gun owner and you care about the Second Amendment,
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:49.380]   have you taken any of your liberal friends shooting in this last year?
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:56.380]   That might be more useful than just about anything else that you can do.
[00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.380]   If there's an issue like that that you care about, make a plan.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.380]   Let's say once a quarter, I'm going to schedule a day at the range
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.380]   and take one of your liberal friends from work
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.380]   or one of your liberal friends from the community
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380]   or one of your liberal neighbors
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   or somebody that wants to take away your gun,
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.380]   take them out and take them shooting.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:19.380]   And then talk to them and ask them why they're opposed to your owning that gun
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.380]   or why they're opposed to your being able to go out and shoot.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.380]   Because what happens is a lot of the conversations
[00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:32.380]   and various political debates are driven by fear.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.380]   And fear paralyzes people.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:43.380]   But oftentimes fear comes from lack of exposure, lack of awareness.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.380]   Consider somebody who comes in from the middle of the bush
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.380]   and all of a sudden sees an escalator for the first time.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.380]   They're not going to immediately want to jump on the escalator.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.380]   But to you, you jump on the escalator and it's no big deal.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.380]   And oftentimes when you look into these political conversations with actual people,
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.380]   I'm not talking about the ideologues who have an agenda
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.380]   of wanting to accomplish change A or accomplish change B.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.380]   I'm talking about people, actual real life breathing people.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.380]   Often what you find is that they have fear over a certain subject
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   because of lack of awareness, lack of exposure.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   So if you have a political issue that's important to you,
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.380]   yeah, fine, send off your money, join the NRA or whatever,
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:29.380]   gun owners of America or whatever political thing it is.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   If you want to do that, great.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.380]   But you'll do a lot more by just choosing another person
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   and getting into their world a little bit, trying to understand them.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.380]   Take them and expose them to what you're aware of.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.380]   Do that with whatever issue you care about.
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.380]   I think you'll start to understand the other side a little bit more
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   and you'll start to have some hope of affecting some other people.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.380]   Next, if there's a political issue that you really care about,
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.380]   before you run out and vote for somebody who promises you something,
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:13.380]   ask yourself is there something that you can actually do that will change the situation.
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:19.380]   Is there a way that you can actually help, first of all?
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:22.380]   It's one thing to vote for the politician who promises,
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:26.380]   "Hey, I'm pro-life. I'm going to do something against abortion."
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:32.380]   It's another thing to have a child yourself or to adopt a child
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   or to get involved in supporting a pregnant mother locally.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:44.380]   It's absolutely insane that there are thousands and thousands of children
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:50.380]   in adoption agencies and foster care agencies all over the country
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:57.380]   who sit there year after year after year without a parent willing to step up and say,
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.380]   "We'll welcome you into our home."
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.380]   Meanwhile, those same parents systematically say,
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.380]   "Yeah, we're in favor of life. We're pro-life."
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:16.380]   Don't just talk. Do something. Do something that you can do.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:19.380]   All of a sudden, if you start doing something,
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.380]   you pull down a lot of your opponent's arguments.
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.380]   So get involved.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.380]   I'm not here to tell you what you can or can't do,
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:32.380]   but recognize that there's something you can do
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.380]   in whatever political area that you care about.
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.380]   You may not be able to adopt a child,
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:44.380]   but can you go and help a mother who is pregnant and who is struggling?
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.380]   Can you go and make a car payment for her every month?
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   Can you go and take food or organize a group of people to take food to her
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.380]   four or five days a week to make sure that she's cared for?
[00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.380]   Can you help to provide for her?
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.380]   You can do that.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.380]   So if you have a political opinion,
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.380]   I use that just because it's very important to me,
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.380]   and I try to talk from the heart about things that are important to me,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.380]   and I try to take my own medicine.
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:17.380]   But if you have a political issue that you care about,
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.380]   see before yelling about it.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.380]   See if there's something that you can do.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.380]   And don't try to go and pass a tax
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.380]   and coerce everybody in your town to join up with you and do something.
[00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   Just get a couple of your friends involved.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.380]   Your hope for the future will be destroyed
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.380]   if your hope depends on organizing 150 million people
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   in the United States of America to agree with you.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:53.380]   Again, your hope for the future will be destroyed
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:59.380]   if your hope depends on organizing 150 million people
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.380]   in the United States of America to agree with you.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.380]   Just making that number up because it's about half of the U.S. population,
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.380]   somewhere about that.
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:12.380]   Don't start with 150 million
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   if you can't get your next-door neighbor to work with you,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:23.380]   or if you can't get your friends at church to work with you.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:28.380]   Again, pick on adoption because it's important to me.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:35.380]   In my state, there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands,
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.380]   of people who come together as a local church body.
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.380]   Those churches contain anywhere from a few to hundreds or thousands of people.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.380]   And yet there are a few thousand kids
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:53.380]   sitting on the Florida State foster care rolls,
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.380]   unloved, unadopted.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.380]   That, my friends, is unacceptable.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.380]   So do what you can do.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.380]   You may not be able to open your home to a child,
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.380]   but can you get two or three of your neighbors
[00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.380]   and make some food for somebody in your church
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:16.380]   or community who is fostering a child?
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   Can you help some of those moms who are struggling?
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.380]   If you think that voting is going to change something, you're wrong.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.380]   It doesn't change anything.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.380]   What happens is people change things,
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.380]   and the votes are reflective of those changes,
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:42.380]   which leads me--I've already stolen my own thunder--to number 10.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.380]   Start with yourself and focus on one area of influence
[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   where you think you can actually make a change.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.380]   Recognize this.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.380]   You can't help somebody else
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:00.380]   until first you've squared away your own problems.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.380]   Jesus said it like this.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:08.380]   Take the log out of your own eye
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.380]   before you try to worry about the speck that's in your brother's eye.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.380]   Now, there are two things implied in that.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   Number one, and in context with that scripture passage,
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.380]   number one, you've got to actually take the log out of your own eye
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.380]   before going and taking the speck out of your brother's eye.
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.380]   But number two, there is a place,
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.380]   once you've taken the log out of your own eye,
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:35.380]   where you have to go and work on the speck.
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.380]   But don't try to go and fix all the problems of the world
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.380]   until you've started with one very simple problem
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.380]   in your own life and in your own family
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:49.380]   and with your next-door neighbor, whoever that is.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:53.380]   You can't help the poor if you're poor.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:45:00.380]   Let the rich help the poor and you help yourself.
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.380]   Don't try to vote help to the poor.
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.380]   Just help yourself.
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.380]   And then, once you're not poor anymore,
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.380]   go and help somebody who's poor.
[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.380]   And if you help one person who's poor,
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   then go and help another person who's poor.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.380]   And over time, you might be able to help three or four.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   And let the people who've helped a few thousand people who are poor
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   go on and help the millions to not be poor anymore.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:30.380]   You can't help your neighbor with food if you don't have any food.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.380]   You can't help your neighbor with their marriage problems
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:36.380]   if your marriage is a mess.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:42.380]   You can't help the kid on the street if your kids are a mess.
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.380]   So start with yourself and focus on the one area of influence
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.380]   where you can actually make a change.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.380]   I'm convinced that there's a continuum
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:54.380]   between those who talk about problems and those who solve problems.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:57.380]   And the people who talk incessantly about problems
[00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.380]   are probably the ones who are the least engaged in actually solving problems.
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.380]   And the people who are the most engaged in actually solving problems
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.380]   are probably the ones who want to talk the least.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.380]   I must confess that I myself have far too often
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   been at the wrong end of that spectrum.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:25.380]   A lot of talk, very little action.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.380]   So I'm starting and have started with me for a long time now.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.380]   But I'm encouraging you to do the same thing.
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:42.380]   It's fine to talk, but your talk must be borne out in action.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.380]   So begin with those closest to you.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:49.380]   Begin with yourself, begin with your family, begin with your neighbor.
[00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.380]   And don't worry about the rest of the country.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.380]   Because the rest of the country, unfortunately,
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:00.380]   is just a reflection of all the other people in it.
[00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:04.380]   And you can't do anything about them.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:10.380]   You can only do something about you.
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.380]   I want to read a quote because it's just a friend of mine,
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.380]   a buddy of mine actually here where I live in Florida.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.380]   And he wrote this as a Facebook post during the recent election cycle.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   And I just thought it was so powerful.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:30.380]   It talked about the most powerful thing that the central government has stolen
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:36.380]   from you and from me, from the people of these United States.
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.380]   Here's what it is. Here's the quote.
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380]   I used to say we just need more people paying attention to what's really going on.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   The problem is human attention is most attracted to the biggest and the loudest things,
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.380]   not the smallest and most important things.
[00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.380]   And so there is self-indulgent activities that I used to participate in all the time,
[00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.380]   convinced that by participation in those activities,
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:10.380]   those big, loud, obnoxious activities, I was actually making an impact.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:16.380]   The most powerful thing that the central government has stolen from the people
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:22.380]   of these United States is human attention.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   You might be thinking they've stolen my money or they burden me with regulations
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.380]   or they've messed up educating our children or something else.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:34.380]   By giving the federal government the responsibility of all those things,
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:41.380]   you have essentially made it impossible to actually get them back to where they belong,
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.380]   which is in your hands.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.380]   During the revolution, it was not said we should replace the king in order to get our freedom.
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:56.380]   Rather, it was said we should remove the king's power in all of our local communities
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.380]   so that we can be free.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.380]   How did they do this?
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.380]   One, anyone who was sent by the king of England to their local communities,
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.380]   they made it very uncomfortable for them to stay.
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:13.380]   Two, any business that was supporting the king of England was immediately on the list of the people
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.380]   to no longer purchase goods or services from that business.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.380]   Three, they transferred all of their wealth that they had possession of
[00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.380]   into the hands of people they trusted locally.
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.380]   Four, they prayed fervently for victory.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:36.380]   Where will your attention continue to go?
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:41.380]   End quote.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.380]   Powerful, isn't it?
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:49.380]   The most powerful thing that the central government has stolen from you
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:58.380]   and from me is our attention.
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:03.380]   See, the sad truth is that in the United States, the federal government is bankrupt.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.380]   Now, it will continue on just about like it is for the coming decades.
[00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:11.380]   And who knows when that bankruptcy will be evident?
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.380]   Who knows when it will actually be reflected?
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.380]   It will probably look nothing like the dramatic thing that a movie
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.380]   or your latest greatest favorite dystopian fiction paints it out to be.
[00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:28.380]   Bankruptcies are often very slow until they're quick.
[00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.380]   And over the coming decades, I expect to live through the systematic bankruptcy
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.380]   of the United States federal government.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.380]   But here's the question.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:47.380]   When the federal government is clearly acknowledged by you and by me to be bankrupt,
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:51.380]   who or what will be ready to take the place?
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:55.380]   Will it be another tyrant ready to stand up and say, "Vote for me
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:00.380]   because I'll make everything great again"?
[00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:08.380]   Or will it be you and me and millions just like us in our own little communities
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:13.380]   having stepped up and done what needed to be done?
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:24.380]   Not in the name of tyranny and control and coercion, but through service.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.380]   Get out of the trap of thinking that if you can just control enough other people,
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.380]   everything will be great.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.380]   That is not the way to victory.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   Oh, sure, a few people can get there over time.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.380]   But over time, their deeds are exposed and they will lose their influence and control.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.380]   So although they may seem to have control and they may seem to have power,
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:49.380]   their power and their control will be short-lived.
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:59.380]   Instead of that, recognize that the way to gain power is through service.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:06.380]   The way to gain influence is not through forcing or coercing other people,
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   but through leadership.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   If you're still listening to this show, 51 minutes and 45 seconds in,
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   and if you care about anything I have to say,
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:21.380]   which I assume by the fact that you're still listening, you do,
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.380]   please notice that I have never once coerced you to do so.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.380]   I didn't come and strap your headphones to your head and say, "You must listen or else."
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   I didn't bring a gun to your house and say, "You've got to listen to Radical Personal Finance."
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:45.380]   Not a single time have I ever coerced you in any way.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.380]   I've actually tried. I haven't necessarily tried to make it hard for you to listen,
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   but I've put up roadblocks in your path.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.380]   There are things that I've done that I could do differently that would have made this far more palatable
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.380]   and far easier for you, but you're still here.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:12.380]   You're still listening of your own free and voluntary choice.
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:16.380]   I didn't coerce you to be here.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.380]   I served you and you chose to be here.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:29.380]   Now, go and do likewise.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:33.380]   Why do all the politicians care if you vote?
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:37.380]   Because they get their power from you.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:47.380]   So, they rile you up and they incite your emotions and then they do absolutely nothing that they said they're going to do.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   They try sometimes.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.380]   I guess I was a little bit overstated when I said they do nothing they said they're going to do.
[00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:59.380]   They do a little bit of it.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:06.380]   But all of that was a line of lies that they fed you to get you emotionally engaged in the process.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:14.380]   Why? Because if you're not emotionally engaged, you don't show up to vote for them and then they don't have any power.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:22.380]   Because half of these men and women couldn't do anything if it weren't for that one skill of getting you angry enough to vote them into office.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.380]   They can't produce anything.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   All they know how to do is accrete and exercise political power.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:39.380]   They need you for their power.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   But you don't need them.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:52.380]   No matter who wins the election tomorrow, you can do any of those things above that I said.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:55:00.380]   Nothing will change with your ability to change.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:06.380]   So, I recommend that you ignore them and you focus on you.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.380]   Remember, back to Stephen Covey's example.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.380]   He was not original with him but he popularized it.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:19.380]   You have your circle of concern and you have your circle of control.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:24.380]   The circle of concern is all the things that you care about in the world.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:30.380]   Of which there are for you and for me thousands, tens of thousands of things.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:36.380]   I care about many, many things.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.380]   So do you.
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   That circle is huge.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   And if you think about that circle, it's so utterly overwhelming you don't know where to start.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.380]   But there's another circle and that's called your circle of control.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.380]   Your circle of influence.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.380]   The things that you can actually do.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:05.380]   So you might be concerned about global climate change but you can't do anything about that.
[00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:13.380]   What you can do is plant some trees and flowers in your front and back yard.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:18.380]   You might be concerned about how workers are treated in China.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.380]   But you can't do anything about that.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:28.380]   What you can do is think about how you're treating the person that you've hired.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:35.380]   You might be concerned about the national debt but you can't do anything about that.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:40.380]   What you can do is do something about your own debt.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   So the secret to power and influence and growth is to focus exclusively on that circle of control.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:55.380]   And not to worry too much about the circle of concern.
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:57:01.380]   If you need to read a newspaper or keep an eye on the morning headlines just so you feel connected, that's fine.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.380]   But don't think you're doing anything by it.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:10.380]   Just recognize I'm kind of just keeping my interest titillated.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:20.380]   The more you focus on your circle of control, on the things that you can actually change, the more those things will change.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:25.380]   And then you start to harvest the power of the compound effect.
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:31.380]   See, money compounds over time but so do many other things in life.
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:36.380]   And all the little actions that you take in your circle of control will compound.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   And over time, your circle of control will become much bigger.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:46.380]   If you're faithful with a little, the time will come when you have a lot.
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:51.380]   So you can't do anything about the national debt but you can do something about your debt.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:56.380]   And as you're doing something about your debt, your next door neighbor will get inspired as you share your story with them.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.380]   And they'll do something about their debt.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:11.380]   And then as they do something about their debt, then all of a sudden, they'll inspire a couple of their neighbors and a few of their neighbors will do something about their debt.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.380]   All of a sudden, you have all kinds of people who are increasingly becoming debt-free.
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   And all of a sudden, as they start to experience less control by their creditors and by the people that they owe money to,
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:28.380]   all of a sudden now those people will systematically feel more emboldened.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.380]   And they won't live their lives in constant fear thinking, "Well, I need the government to step in and bail me out.
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.380]   I need the government to step in and pay off my student loans.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:43.380]   And if we don't elect the right person, I'm going to be facing destruction because of my student loans."
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   You can't do anything about global warming but you can plant a garden bed in your backyard or in your front yard.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.380]   And what happens is that as you do that, maybe your next door neighbor will.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:59.380]   All of a sudden, you're growing some food and they're growing some food and you're making your community beautiful.
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.380]   You're pumping some oxygen into the environment.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:09.380]   You're taking out some carbon dioxide and that has a ripple effect.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:12.380]   So, all these little actions compound.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:17.380]   Now, once you've taken care of yourself and your family and your next door neighbor and a couple of your buddies,
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:21.380]   then maybe go ahead and you can expand a little bigger.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.380]   But don't go too big.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:31.380]   And certainly don't go too big too quickly.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   I encourage you if you're listening to this before going out and voting on November 8th, go and vote.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.380]   That's what you need to do.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:43.380]   Vote as you feel you need to vote for the reasons that you think you need to vote.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   But don't delude yourself into thinking that your vote has any meaning or impact more than simple symbolism.
[00:59:53.380 --> 01:00:02.380]   And don't ignore where the power actually is.
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:13.380]   And then when you're done voting, come on home and sit down and make a plan for something that you can change in your own life.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.380]   Something that you can change that will actually be valuable.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   Something that will actually make a difference.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:24.380]   I think you'll be glad you did.
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:28.380]   That's the end of today's podcast for the majority of you.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.380]   But I do have one just very short encouragement.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.380]   I know I said when I talk about religion that would be a good time to hit fast forward.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:35.380]   This will not be relevant to you.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:41.380]   But I know many of you in my listening audience are Christians.
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:46.380]   I want to just encourage you with a couple of simple thoughts.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:54.380]   This election season has been incredibly challenging for those of you like me who are disciples of Christ.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.380]   Incredibly challenging.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.380]   The issues at stake are monumental.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.380]   Seeking to discern what is happening is so incredibly difficult.
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:08.380]   The rancor and the divisiveness goes deep.
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:13.380]   And the arguments are on every hand.
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:20.380]   I just want to encourage you with one simple passage of scripture that I think is incredibly powerful.
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.380]   I think there's a lot of instruction.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:36.380]   Here in the United States we seem to be in a period of time where more and more those of you who have a desire to stand for God's truth will face more and more challenges.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   I don't see, although the world situation is very different than the U.S. situation, that much seems apparent to me.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   That means there's a time of testing.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   Testing is good.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.380]   Trials are good.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   Testing is to be welcomed.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   But oftentimes it means, it leads to a question of what do I do?
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:07.380]   I encourage you, go back and if you haven't read it recently, go back and read the book of Jeremiah.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:16.380]   And I'm just going to read one very short passage that, especially in light of my comments today, for those of you who are Christians, I think is incredibly valuable.
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   Remember, much of the context of Jeremiah is where the people of Israel are sent into exile.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:29.380]   God judged them for their collective sin and they're sent into exile for hundreds of years.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.380]   And they're sent into slavery.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   But here is the instruction that came to them through the prophet Jeremiah in chapter 29.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   I'm keeping this very short.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:49.380]   You go and read the book for yourself and figure out how and whether to apply this to your own life.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.380]   But this is important.
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:59.380]   "Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:03.380]   Build houses and live in them.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:07.380]   Plant gardens and eat their produce.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   Take wives and have sons and daughters.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   Take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage that they may bear sons and daughters.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:20.380]   Multiply there and do not decrease.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile and pray to the Lord on its behalf.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:36.380]   For in its welfare, you will find your welfare."
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.380]   It continues on. I just emphasize that again.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:46.380]   "Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile and pray to the Lord on its behalf.
[01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:52.380]   For in its welfare, you will find your welfare."
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:57.380]   As the acrimony of this election season has mounted,
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:10.380]   I encourage you to be one of those who is diligently engaged in seeking the welfare of the city where you are.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   Don't constantly be one who stands up and has nothing but negative words to say.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   Be one who's active, who's doing actively engaging in all of these things that I've said here in today's show,
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   and who's carefully and diligently seeking the welfare of your family, your friends, and your neighbors.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   Finally, if you're a Christian, be very careful to guard your attitude.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   It's easy when you're put upon, it's easy when you're attacked to respond and to revile back out of a sense of righteous indignation and justice.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:55.380]   But recognize that you're called to be humble, and I'm called to be humble.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.380]   We're called to have a response that's different.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:05.380]   If you'd like a valuable book to meditate on as we go into election day, whether it's the night of election night or whatever,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.380]   take eight or nine minutes and go back and read the book of 2 Peter.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:19.380]   Encourage yourself with the attitude that God wants you to have, and be very thankful that God is slow.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:30.380]   Not because He is slow, but because He has a desire, as 2 Peter says, that each person would be able to come to a place of repentance.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:37.380]   So don't gloat, don't despair, just get to work.
[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:43.380]   And do it with the right attitude and the right purpose of heart.
