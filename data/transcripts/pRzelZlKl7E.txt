[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Dan Gable
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.460]   from two years ago.
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.660]   I did not previously publish this conversation
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.020]   as part of this podcast, but as a separate thing.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.620]   And as a result, it did not receive many listens.
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.160]   Let me be honest and say that while I usually don't care
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.860]   about how many listens or views something gets,
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.580]   in this one case, I feel like I failed one of my heroes.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.300]   I feel I didn't properly introduce
[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.260]   a truly special human being to an audience
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.380]   that might find him as inspiring as I did.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.020]   Dan Gable is one of the greatest Olympic athletes
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.300]   of all time.
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300]   Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself,
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.340]   he's a symbol of guts, spirit, mental toughness,
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.420]   and relentless hard work.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.180]   As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school,
[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.620]   undefeated in college until his very last match.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.580]   And having lost that match, he found another level
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.780]   and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.
[00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.700]   And most importantly, he did so perfectly,
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.380]   dominating his opponents.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.180]   He did not surrender a single point
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.740]   at the 1972 Olympic Games.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.300]   As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.020]   and 25 consecutive Big Ten championships.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820]   He coached 152 All-Americans, 45 national champions,
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.260]   106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians,
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.220]   including eight medalists.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.900]   He's the author of several books,
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.780]   including "A Wrestling Life 1 and 2"
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.540]   and "Coaching Wrestling Successfully."
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.260]   Quick mention of our sponsors.
[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.500]   Trial Labs, a machine learning company,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.740]   ExpressVPN, Grammarly Writing Helper Tool,
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.140]   and SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.740]   So the choice is AI, privacy, grammar, or safety.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.220]   Choose wisely, my friends.

[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.940]   As a side note, let me say that I spent a few days in Iowa
[00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.300]   and got to attend a wrestling duel meet
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.820]   in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.420]   Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever,
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.100]   to drill takedowns, to start a family, to live life simply.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460]   Wrestling is one of the pure sports,
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.860]   both beautiful and brutal,
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.620]   where both mental toughness and technical mastery
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.980]   of the highest form are rewarded with victory,
[00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.940]   and everything else is punished with defeat.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.100]   And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.220]   of anyone who has ever stepped on the wrestling mat,
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.980]   including myself.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.900]   The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.380]   in history of the sport,
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.180]   the man who graciously welcomed me into his home
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.100]   for this conversation, the legend, Dan Gable.

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.860]   And now, here's my conversation with Dan Gable.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.260]   - You're persistent, and I love that,
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.900]   because you've been trying to get me on this podcast
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.260]   for a long time.
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.900]   And until I saw you on another podcast,
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.420]   and you said you were Russian, did I call you back?
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.380]   - Then it was over.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.700]   - Because Russia, to me, is leading the world in wrestling,
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.900]   almost every year.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.540]   - What's the difference between American wrestling
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.380]   and Russian wrestling?
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.580]   You showed me this painting.
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.580]   - Well, it's MIT, it's science.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.500]   - It's science.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.860]   - And they really study the sport.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.140]   They're really good technically.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.700]   They're really good in strategy.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.140]   They don't really push the real toughness.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.460]   They don't push conditioning.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.800]   And so Americans, we need what they have.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.900]   Russians need what we have.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.620]   And when you get the two together.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.580]   And for me, why I could beat the Russians
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.220]   is because I went their way a little bit,
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.660]   but I kept my toughness.
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.100]   - But you're known for your toughness.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.060]   - Yeah, but I wasn't known for my art.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.060]   (laughing)
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.980]   I wasn't known for my science.
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.020]   - So when did you become a bit of an artist?
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.780]   - It took a loss.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.620]   - The Larry Owens loss.
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.740]   - Most people thought I was already an artist
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.460]   just because I won 181 straight matches in seven years.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.060]   And not just winning, but kind of punishing people.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.980]   And from that point of view,
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.300]   yeah, I might've been pretty good,
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.340]   but I had a long ways to go yet.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.700]   And I didn't really realize that,
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.140]   or I should say, I didn't really know
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.340]   how to get it out of me until I had a loss.
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.560]   And then I realized I got to buckle down,
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.560]   learn some of that science, become more of an artist.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.580]   - How do you become an artist?
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.580]   So the Russian way has this drilling technique,
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.780]   thousands of reps.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.740]   How do you think you work on the science, the art part?
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.860]   - You got to study the best in the world.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.380]   I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.380]   that probably showed us that being artistic, you needed that.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.460]   And he studied it.
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.660]   He went over there as a high schooler
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.980]   and wrestled in some major tournaments over there.
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.180]   And he saw their ways.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.960]   He used that Russian science,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.740]   and then he was already an American
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.000]   and he saw how I trained athletes.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.700]   He saw what I did in the Olympics,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.380]   saw what other people, how we held up,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.900]   and he applied that as well.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.180]   But I'd have to say he was more the artistic type.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.180]   He was more of a Russian than an American
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.500]   when it came to wrestling.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.300]   - You've coached 45 national champions,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.980]   106 Big Ten champions, and eight Olympic medalists,
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.580]   which is incredible.
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.680]   What is a common thread between them
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.540]   and what are maybe some of the fundamental differences?
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.500]   - I think the common thread is that
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.500]   they all had one of those two avenues that we talked already
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.140]   and because we intertwined them.
[00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.360]   So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.100]   Most of the time in an American wrestling room,
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.520]   we had the same people.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.620]   But when I was out recruiting,
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.040]   at first I recruited just attitude,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.800]   but I needed more than that.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.380]   I needed some genetics in that wrestling room
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.500]   to actually, that hard work people,
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.500]   they could look and see, wow, that execution,
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.820]   that's unbelievable.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.360]   But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   - So you think the art, the technique is genetics,
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.760]   you're born with it.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.600]   You think it's not something--
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   - I think your pop and your ability to move--
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.240]   - Timing.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.320]   - And timing and your quickness and your strength.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.200]   You know, the Russians, they usually picked out
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.760]   the people that can go into that sport.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.140]   That was the old-fashioned sports school.
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.000]   But it's mostly like when you walk
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.780]   into a Russian wrestling room,
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.200]   you see them hitting skills, techniques.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.480]   You don't see them banging against each other that much.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.120]   But then when practice is over,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.920]   you might not see a bunch of sprints,
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   you might see them walk over to the ropes
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.160]   and they drop down from the ceiling
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   and they'll jump up and climb a rope, boom, boom, boom.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.440]   And then they come down
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.680]   and then they don't jump right back on.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   They have three or four other guys go
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.760]   and then they jump back on.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.040]   Whereas I probably made my guys climb 'em,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.920]   get right back down, climb 'em right back again.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.520]   - What was the role, what was your role?
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.080]   I mean, those guys looked up and Dan Gable
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.600]   and what was the role in helping these athletes
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.520]   become their best, these national champions?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.620]   - Well, you had to first of all prove
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.360]   that you knew what you were doing.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.400]   - In terms of technique or in terms of--
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.600]   - Everything, everything.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.680]   They just, you had to be the first guy there
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.600]   and the last guy to leave
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.440]   and you had to be the most dedicated guy,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440]   even though they were the ones
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.000]   that's trying to win the championships.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.980]   You had to prove that you were gonna work
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.920]   just as hard as they were as a coach.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.280]   - And what does that look like?
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.180]   So you can see it when you, you know it when you see it?
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.200]   - Well, you're there ahead of 'em
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.360]   and you're there after they leave.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.200]   (laughing)
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.800]   You know, it's that simple.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.920]   I'm picking up after 'em and you're analyzing 'em.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.400]   You outwork 'em, you outwork 'em and you outthink 'em.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.240]   And so, you know, use that type of strategy.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.860]   And over time, when you prove it works,
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.520]   because some of my kids that were the best kids in the world
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.600]   really shouldn't have been a wrestler.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.520]   I mean, they weren't very coordinated.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.080]   (laughing)
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.940]   But they worked so hard, they developed themselves.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.400]   - What was your role in that process?
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.600]   I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.920]   If you're not--
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.680]   - Yeah, but you can't push kids to their limit.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.480]   And even when you push 'em to their limit,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.800]   that's not their limit.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.640]   'Cause their limit's above and beyond that.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.080]   I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don't,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.000]   they lose kids.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.840]   - Yeah.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.040]   - Because of the heat, because of hard work and all that.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.680]   And you gotta know when to back off.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.540]   You gotta read your athletes.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.160]   And by that I mean, you gotta know 'em pretty well.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.100]   Every once in a while, you make a little bit of a mistake.
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.120]   But if you don't react right on that mistake
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.560]   before it gets too far, then it's gonna be a casualty.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.040]   And I don't mean somebody dying necessarily,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.840]   but maybe something that could turn 'em off,
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.240]   or maybe something that could run 'em away,
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.840]   or maybe something that, wow, that was close.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.040]   Maybe shouldn't have pushed 'em that far.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.640]   So you really have to be very educated.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.640]   And it's not just what you know,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.320]   it's what you know about them.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.920]   And I'm not talking about the team.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.320]   I'm talking about each guy on the team.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.160]   - Individuals, yeah.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.360]   - Yeah, each person on the team.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.440]   - And you know it how?
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.280]   You see it in their eyes?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.100]   - You know it how?
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.920]   Because you're the first one there,
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.200]   and you're the last one to leave,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.760]   and you sit in the environment with 'em.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.280]   You're there in the morning for practice sometimes,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.320]   you're there in the afternoon for two or three hours.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.480]   After practice, you might have a hot room,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.720]   or you might have a sauna, or a steam, or a whirlpool,
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.880]   and you get in there with 'em, and you listen.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.120]   You know, you're not just feeding out information.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.240]   You do that, but you're taking in a lot of that too.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.760]   And I'm telling you, when you get in an atmosphere
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.600]   that they're relaxed, and they feel comfortable,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.640]   it's like a massage.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.600]   And that's after practice, in one of those areas
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   that people are around you, you learn a lot.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.520]   I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.100]   And when you get in that atmosphere,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.240]   when all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.280]   words start flowing.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   And when those words flow, you take 'em in as a coach,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   and there's something probably gonna be said
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.080]   that you can do and act upon
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.320]   that's gonna help certain situations.
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.880]   I've saved a couple of kids' lives, for sure,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.280]   that were on the brink.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.120]   You know, sometimes performance is at such a high level,
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.180]   in a high-level atmosphere,
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.520]   that life and death's actually involved.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.480]   And I don't mean pushing a kid to where he just dies,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.840]   but I mean, he might feel himself as a failure.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.360]   He might go home and take his own life.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.840]   - Yeah, I mean, but that's part of it.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.280]   You're putting so much heart,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.080]   so much blood and heart and sweat,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.520]   and your whole meaning of life becomes winning.
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.600]   So, and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.080]   So, in your, I think, the first wrestling life,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.320]   you wrote about Chad Zapato, who lost,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.880]   I mean, an incredible wrestler,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.440]   but lost in three finals in the nationals,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.000]   and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.200]   Yeah, so what lessons, is there any lessons
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.580]   from the incredible wrestling he's done,
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.080]   but also the incredible suffering
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.040]   that he went through on himself?
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.880]   - Yeah, again, you like that word, suffering, which is okay.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.440]   - Okay, so-- - No, no, no, no, no,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.600]   keep it, keep it, 'cause it fits right in where I want.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   I have to turn that suffering around
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.800]   to where he makes and feels good about himself,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.120]   or better, doesn't have to feel perfect,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.360]   'cause he did lose, you know?
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.580]   And so, but you have to actually get him to realize
[00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.440]   that, yeah, he's still unique.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.960]   Compared to the walk of the earth,
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.880]   he was unbelievably unique, right at the top,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.960]   just a little bit short of, but because it was,
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.080]   you know, he felt the suffering,
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.680]   you now have to go about and change that
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.800]   and put it into goodwill some way.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.560]   And because you really have a lot of goodwill,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.360]   you can do a lot of goodwill.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.640]   And so, and it's not easy.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   It took him probably years, years of tattooing,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.400]   years of covering the tattoos.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.040]   And, you know, he told me he moved to,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.440]   I go, "Why you moving to California?"
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.200]   'Cause he was here for a couple years
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.160]   after his wrestling was done, 'cause he had a good job
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.280]   around here and he was, I thought he was doing a good job,
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.720]   but he just, he said, "I had to escape."
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.880]   Yeah, same as the covering up the tattoo.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.240]   I had a wrestling terminology, I have to get,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.120]   I hate to say this, I hate to say this.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.800]   I go, "Where are you going?"
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.760]   He said, "I'm gonna go to California."
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.280]   And I go, "Is there any reason
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.920]   "why you're going to California?"
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.520]   He says, "That's where everybody goes to hide."
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.080]   But I said, "I think you're wrong there,
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.000]   "but I think what will determine your life
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.080]   "will be what you do from now on."
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.240]   And if you can find, and he's actually turned it around.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.440]   I mean, it's a journey. He's actually turned it around.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.880]   You have to discover that yourself.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.280]   Exactly, and he went someplace
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.040]   that he thought he could fit into, and I think he did.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.940]   And I think he's got a good job and he's helping people.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.940]   He covered that tattoo with feathers, another tattoo.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.540]   - Well, in the end, it's a beautiful story.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.540]   - Yeah, it is, it really is.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.940]   - Of suffering and overcoming.
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.140]   - Yeah, and he's not done yet.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.980]   - He's not done yet.
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.820]   - No, he's not done.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   He's got a lot more to do.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.580]   - So you mentioned Roger Bannister,
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.620]   again, I think in your first book,
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.460]   and somebody you looked up to.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.140]   That's the man who broke the four-minute mile, right?
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.020]   When everybody said it was impossible,
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.420]   everyone thought it was impossible.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.620]   - Oh, they thought you would die.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:45.460]   - You would die.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.340]   It's not humanly possible.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.180]   - Yeah.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.100]   - So what--
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.820]   - Well, you've done your homework.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.940]   - For what, the book, or what?
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:52.780]   - Oh, I don't know, for me.
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.620]   You've done your homework.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.940]   - Yeah, I know, but yeah.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.500]   Sent here by Putin to do research, yeah.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.060]   So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself?
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.900]   The impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.500]   - Well, the impossible is possible.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.380]   It's just that simple.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.100]   Time changes things.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.100]   I mean, if you looked at where the mile time is right now
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.620]   compared to that four-minute mile,
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.180]   which when it was broke by a couple tenths
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.700]   or three or four tenths,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.540]   it's now broke by another 20 seconds.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.980]   - Yeah, by several hundred people, yeah.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.220]   - Yeah, I mean, by tons of people.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.500]   And it's pretty much common knowledge
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.700]   that you gotta run a four-minute mile
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.980]   if you're gonna go somewhere now,
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.020]   or below if you're gonna win events at major level,
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.820]   that you gotta be able to do that.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.860]   And so you can take that and you can look at what
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:56.540]   in time history has as its record performance,
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.740]   and you can realize that,
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.620]   ah, that record performance, it's gonna change.
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.460]   - Yeah.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.400]   - And they don't take into all the factors of knowledge.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.540]   They don't take in all the factors of better shoes.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.860]   They don't take in all the factors
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.940]   of better understanding of nutrition.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.060]   I mean, it's like me as an athlete.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.740]   I went to practice every day in high school
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.740]   for at least my sophomore and my junior
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.980]   and part of my senior year,
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.000]   and all of a sudden, a new rule came up.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.400]   It said, the rule said, before that,
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.580]   said, at least most of the coaches,
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.600]   we don't want you drinking water at practice.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.440]   - Yeah.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.000]   - And, okay, why?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.440]   'Cause you gotta toughen you up.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.460]   That's a weakness, water.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.320]   And so we would go through practice.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.600]   I mean, and you're sweating,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.820]   and then you're sweating so much
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.640]   that you're almost out of sweat.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.480]   - Yeah.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.840]   - And so you're mostly, at the end of practice,
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.600]   you're not even wrestling.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.440]   Excuse me.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.840]   You're sitting against a wall.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.680]   - Yeah.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.500]   - 'Cause you're tired.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.640]   So then all of a sudden, they say,
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.960]   okay, go ahead and drink water during practice.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.400]   Drink Gatorade during practice.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.240]   And all of a sudden, at the end of practice,
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.200]   we're still out there competing.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.160]   And so I look at my career for two and a half years,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.000]   where I, and junior high too,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.520]   so I got another three years,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.880]   where I didn't really, wasn't able to push
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.560]   as good as I could because I just was probably under.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.400]   - Under hydrated.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.220]   - Yeah.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.080]   - Yeah, so what, so, but at the individual level,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.800]   in terms of the impossible,
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.440]   when did you first believe the thing
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.240]   that maybe probably people would laugh at you about
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.640]   that you would be an Olympic champion?
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.920]   - Well, I always visualized me being the best.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.080]   - You believed it in the very beginning.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.760]   - Forever, forever.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.840]   Yeah, I was, because I was a,
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.520]   I don't know if you should call it a dreamer
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.240]   or somebody that, I was just involved
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.200]   with competitive sports at the YMCA from age five.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.680]   - Did you tell people that dream,
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.080]   that you're gonna be Olympic champion one day?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.360]   You're gonna be the best in the world?
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.280]   - I think they knew.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.520]   And the only reason why they knew,
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.160]   'cause there was something a little different
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.000]   about this guy.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.840]   He was--
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.660]   - He's not gonna stop.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.160]   - Well, he was out in the yard.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.000]   - Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.280]   - And he was swinging baseball bats.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.120]   - Yeah.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.440]   - You know, at six, at seven, at eight, at nine, at 10.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.200]   And he was swinging baseball bats
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.520]   so much right-handed and so much left-handed
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.560]   with nobody even there throwing the ball.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.840]   That all of a sudden when they walked by,
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.160]   all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt on both sides.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.600]   So it's like, they saw me out in the yard
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.320]   playing by myself sports,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.880]   or you know, or you get the neighborhood kids
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.820]   and you play a lot.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.960]   But if they weren't there, you know,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.600]   if you walked in my front room,
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.120]   I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.160]   And I was running and running through the furniture,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.000]   you know, that type of stuff.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.320]   So, you know, who saw this guy mostly
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.520]   was probably the parents.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.360]   - Yeah.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.680]   - And the coaches at the YMCA level, the junior high level,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.440]   they saw this guy come first and end up last.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.600]   But I wasn't that great.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.200]   I wasn't the fastest guy at that time.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.220]   And I wasn't the strongest guy.
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.900]   You know, actually before I went to the Olympics,
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.080]   when they tested me, they tested everybody.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.020]   And I probably came back with one of the highest scores,
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.760]   but it was not like the highest person
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.340]   on this and this and that.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.340]   I was all high across the board,
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.160]   straight across the board high on every one of them.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.820]   But there was always people that were higher than me.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.660]   - Genetics.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.980]   - But then they would go down.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.820]   - Yeah.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.660]   - Then they would test on something else,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:50.500]   they'd go back up.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.020]   Mine stayed high all across the board.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.120]   And so I really didn't have too many flaws,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.640]   but I didn't have any things that also said
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.560]   that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic Games.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.380]   - Right.
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.120]   So take me through that day if you could.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.580]   1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.400]   freestyle wrestling gold.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.760]   You scored 57 points, if I'm correct,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.040]   and had zero points scored on you.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.940]   57, zero.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.080]   So maybe take me through almost the details.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.000]   What was your routine?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.960]   What was your process?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.440]   What was going through your mind,
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.040]   your thoughts of that day?
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.580]   - Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.920]   because we weighed in every day at that time.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.760]   - In the morning?
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   - Yeah, we weighed in two hours
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.160]   before the start of the competition.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.480]   And so that didn't mean that you weighed in two hours
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.600]   before you wrestled, 'cause you didn't know
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.120]   whether you're gonna wrestle right away or later on.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.520]   In fact, in that day, I don't think I wrestled
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.120]   until later on in the evening, so had all day to recover,
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.800]   but I didn't really need it anyway,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.960]   'cause I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.720]   But it was just interesting.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.680]   - But what was in your mind?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   What were you thinking?
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.160]   Were you nervous?
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   - I was confident.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.640]   I was confident.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.360]   - So you knew you were gonna win the gold?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.240]   - Yeah, I knew I was gonna win.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.480]   But in reality, I didn't know it
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.040]   from a cocky point of view.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.200]   I only knew it because for the last,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.600]   one, two, three and a half years,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.100]   I had been going to practice,
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.000]   and I'd win in every practice.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.840]   - You felt good.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.720]   - And I hardly ever lose a takedown.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.600]   And if I lost, if somebody scored on me,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.920]   it was like when I went to bed,
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.560]   I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.480]   Or if I didn't figure it out, I would fall asleep,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.480]   and I would wake up with the answer
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.200]   of what I needed, why I got scored upon.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.440]   - So maybe now that you've won the gold,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.080]   can you tell me in the practice room,
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.120]   if somebody took you down,
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.080]   Timing, technique?
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.960]   - Very difficult, but somebody could,
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.660]   because they were going for one move.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.000]   All I wanted was one move.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.720]   Whereas if you can arrest somebody,
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.320]   arrest them the whole practice or half a practice
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.480]   for at least 10, 15 minutes,
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.820]   and they were maybe gonna score
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.180]   if they could work it in their mind,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.480]   but they knew that was gonna be their victory.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.360]   - So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.680]   When you're going for the Olympic gold,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.200]   you didn't want to allow any takedowns.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.580]   So there's no such thing as working
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.880]   on some kind of weird position, a weak point,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.700]   or something.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.720]   It's important to not let down, take down.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.960]   - It's kind of like what we were saying before.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.760]   If something happened and somebody scored on me
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.480]   in a certain way, I would go over that situation,
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.880]   over that situation, over it again,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.680]   and I would come up with an answer.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.460]   And then I would actually test it.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.520]   Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.160]   'cause I didn't want the guy to not have some,
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   I didn't want him to think
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.960]   that I was thinking about it all night.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.120]   I didn't tell him.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.140]   But maybe three days later when we wrestled again,
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.460]   Or even if I was in on an offensive move
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.140]   and I got stopped and didn't score,
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.980]   I had to go back and filter that.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:34.220]   But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.780]   I could usually solve it.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.060]   Let's go back to the Olympic game.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.360]   So I get up in the Olympic in the morning,
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.300]   and I'm not sure when the weigh-ins were,
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.320]   but I think I was probably a pound over.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.100]   That's about a half a kilo, 1.1 pounds is a kilo,
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.300]   'cause we went in kilograms.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.540]   So what do you do with that pound?
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.420]   You aren't off or?
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.220]   No, I just went over to the,
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:56.980]   they had a sauna there, and I got in the sauna.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.980]   And the funny thing was, the morning of the finals,
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.740]   there was another athlete in the sauna.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.680]   And it was-- American or?
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.880]   No, it was a European.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   I don't remember where she was from.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.760]   Not a Russian.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.680]   Well, you know what?
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   I kind of think it was a plot, 'cause it was a girl.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.880]   Interesting.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.680]   And she didn't have her top on.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.640]   And that was pretty common.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.040]   And so it's kind of interesting.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.200]   You think back about it,
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.240]   because there's some funny things
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.820]   that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games,
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.540]   in world games, anytime when you have country against country
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.780]   and so there's some crazy stuff that goes on.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.620]   Yeah.
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.140]   Did any of it affect you?
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:49.980]   Was there any?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.820]   Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.060]   (laughing)
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.260]   You lost a little bit over a pound.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.420]   I lost a little more than a pound.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:58.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.940]   But it didn't really bother me,
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.220]   'cause I wasn't cutting a lot of weight.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.120]   So your match against the Russian, the--
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:08.960]   Azhelyev.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.880]   Yeah, Azhelyev.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.040]   He went on to be a two-time world champion,
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.600]   a silver medalist as well.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.560]   I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.560]   So what was going through your mind
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.600]   before stepping on the mat with that guy?
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.240]   You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.600]   haven't had a point scored on you,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.840]   and you're stepping on the mat against a Russian
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.520]   who you said was really,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.360]   they picked, the Soviets picked to beat you.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.200]   Right, and I know why they picked him,
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.740]   because he had a great attitude.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.540]   So he wasn't just the typical artist.
[00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:39.740]   He was a good artist.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.380]   He hooked elbows like Sadylyaev,
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.000]   and he's from that area of the world
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.380]   where they have some of those types of moves,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.020]   and he was a goer,
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.640]   but by cutting down a weight, he lost some of that go.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.100]   And I don't know if,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.620]   that's a process you gotta go about scientifically.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.860]   And so if you don't do it as an American,
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:06.380]   it can really hurt your performance.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.100]   If you don't do it as a Russian,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.140]   it can hurt your performance,
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.760]   and they already didn't really do that a lot,
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.980]   where you usually wrestled a weight
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.140]   where it was more like your weight.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.660]   And so by cutting him down,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.060]   it maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.900]   So you saw it in him.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.260]   The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him.
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.380]   Yeah, but then he came back,
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.660]   and he won the rest of the matches,
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.420]   and he was in the round robin,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.480]   and he was able to go to the finals.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.340]   But he had lost another match, actually,
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.180]   in the round robin against the Japanese.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:44.180]   So I think I had already gained enough of artistic,
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.780]   being able to finish a match.
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.060]   Once I lost my match in college,
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:49.980]   for the last two years,
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.660]   I took on some of that artistic work.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:57.660]   And I think that he was already hoping to win,
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.080]   but he was hoping to win by a long ways
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.540]   because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.260]   to be able to win the gold.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.020]   And that wasn't gonna happen.
[00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.020]   I mean, the chance to pin is pretty good.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.500]   - Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.900]   Have you taken risks where you could pay for them?
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.180]   - I can't remember too many that I took
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.980]   that would actually put me in a danger position.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.340]   I've taken risk,
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.940]   but the risks were so scientifically, technically correct
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:33.120]   that I wouldn't land in that danger zone.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.080]   It's like, if I'm gonna lock up and throw you,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.060]   I'm not gonna throw you to my own back
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.100]   and roll you through.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.300]   I'm gonna turn in the air.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.420]   - So you were scientific about it.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:42.660]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.240]   I learned the hard way.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.680]   Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.980]   that you did that exposed your shoulders,
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.500]   which it cost me in some early freestyle matches
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.580]   against great wrestlers.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.580]   But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves
[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.860]   to where I hit a Gramby roll
[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.260]   where you expose your shoulders
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.020]   and you lose two points every time.
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.400]   But you learn that that's not the system.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.780]   But if you hadn't wrestled much,
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.780]   you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.860]   You would hit it.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.620]   - So you won the gold.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.380]   How did it feel?
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.300]   - I think the question would be,
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.140]   how would it feel if you lost the gold?
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.220]   For me, 'cause I already went through that once.
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.540]   Not at that highest level,
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.820]   but the National Collegiate Championship level,
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.660]   my senior year.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.660]   - The Larry Owings loss.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.020]   - Larry Owings, yeah.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.500]   And that didn't set well.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.340]   - Were you afraid of that happening again
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.420]   at the Olympic level?
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.240]   Was that even--
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.420]   - No, I really wasn't.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.220]   But it was why I changed my philosophy of training
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:57.220]   and added to the scientific artist type.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.100]   And if I had won that match,
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.620]   even though I wouldn't have felt good about it,
[00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.740]   even though I squeaked it out,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.900]   I wasn't feeling good about that match.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.700]   It would have affected me a little bit.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.420]   But if I'd have won it, I would have got over it.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.660]   I mean, I'm not over it now.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.740]   I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.860]   right before my match.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.420]   By that, I mean this kind of stuff, talking--
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.220]   - Interviews, yeah, journalists.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.100]   - Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker then.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.860]   I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now,
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.060]   except for I got a little cold.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.740]   But I don't think I could say two words hardly then.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.580]   And they took takes.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.420]   Wide World of Sports said,
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.460]   "Hey, we want you to be the introduction
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.420]   "for our next week's show."
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.880]   So I just said, "Hey, I'm Dan Gable.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.340]   "Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated, 182 and 0."
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.260]   That's what they want me to say.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.980]   - Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.700]   - And I said it.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.700]   I had to take it 22 times.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.060]   And the last two or three times, they wrote it out.
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.300]   And I read it, and still it wasn't like I just said it.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.820]   I was reading it like, "Hi, I'm Dan Gable.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.100]   "Come, come on."
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.420]   You know, that type of stuff.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.380]   So, and they finally just closed the book
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.140]   and said, "Yeah, that's good enough."
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.380]   But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.180]   And so, you just, you learn that,
[00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.380]   and for me, it was great coaching experience.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.020]   'Cause that's what I turned into be.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.420]   You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.220]   And I put up a lot of champions,
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.660]   but you learn through mistakes
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.480]   that even in your own career that you had made.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.060]   You know, it's an ever learning process.
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.680]   It's an ever learning process.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.020]   - Have you ever been afraid on the mat?
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.700]   Does fear have any role, do you think, for a wrestler?
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.540]   Or it must be--
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.900]   - Well, I'm sure fear is out there.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.380]   And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.020]   I'm sure in my Olympic finals,
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.220]   I was really, he had these doubts.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.860]   He probably had these doubts.
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.940]   And that gives me the edge.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:07.260]   And I don't know if I really ever had fear,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.140]   but obviously there was points in times
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.420]   where I didn't perform as well.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.700]   Not many, but a few.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.140]   And if I look back at it,
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.460]   I don't think it was that American, you know,
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.200]   raw, raw, raw stuff.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.940]   I think it was probably the fear
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.100]   of not being an artist as much.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.180]   You know, maybe this guy might be better than me
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.980]   scientifically.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.420]   And, you know, you're a scientist.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.660]   I think that got to me more than anything else.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.780]   I said early on that I wanna eliminate
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.820]   ever having to worry about getting tired in a match.
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.620]   So I kind of eliminated that.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.420]   So I got rid of that point.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.020]   And I do think that in wrestling,
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.360]   that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.620]   Actually, how they feel during the match.
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.980]   And are they gonna get tired?
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.420]   And is it gonna affect my performance?
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.340]   And as a coach, that really was one of the things
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.540]   I tried to eliminate on all my athletes.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.380]   So there wasn't that fear factor.
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:19.860]   But that fear factor would be put upon my opponent,
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.400]   which would give me an edge.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.740]   But that's not what I needed as much.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.780]   I needed to just focus,
[00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.740]   make sure that I was doing the right things.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.100]   And I needed my team to be focused.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.320]   So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete,
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.140]   or even as a coach sometimes,
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.440]   that I didn't repeat them.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.260]   Didn't repeat them.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.140]   And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.640]   then it's like you didn't learn anything.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.800]   - Your goal throughout your wrestling career,
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.440]   as you've beautifully put,
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.400]   was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.160]   That you would be carried off the mat.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.500]   So you never did successfully.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.440]   That's one of the ways you failed in your career,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.420]   is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.640]   Have you ever come close?
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   Do you remember a time that you've come close
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.000]   that you've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   - You know, the question's really a good question
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.960]   about that pushing to you collapse.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.880]   Because as a coach today,
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.960]   I don't think I could,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.700]   if I said that to my athletes,
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.640]   I don't know, I could get in trouble.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.120]   Because it's like--
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.160]   - But it's understood, isn't it?
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.720]   By the athletes?
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.000]   - Yeah, they understand it.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.480]   But the outside might not understand it.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.000]   Because it's almost like, what do you mean?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.840]   You push them to the point where they go collapse.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.800]   That means they might die,
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.080]   or something might happen to them.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.920]   And that's dangerous.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.760]   That's dangerous.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.200]   We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.520]   But it's something that's highly unlikely
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   that's gonna happen.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.180]   But I'm gonna tell you,
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.200]   there's many times in a practice
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.960]   where I had pushed myself
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.520]   to all of a sudden the whistle blew,
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.360]   or it was time to stop.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.300]   And when I got up off the mat,
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.920]   or wherever I was at,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.520]   and I needed water,
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.840]   I needed fresh air.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.440]   'Cause you're usually in a fairly small room
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.600]   with a lot of guys,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.480]   that the heat rises,
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.000]   and it's hard to breathe.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.640]   And that I can remember,
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.840]   and I stayed a lot of times not by the door,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.440]   the far end of the room.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.720]   I can remember walking from the far end of the room
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:23.640]   to that door.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.880]   And I can remember,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.160]   am I gonna make it the next step?
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.960]   Am I gonna make it the next step?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.560]   I need air, I need water,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.120]   I need oxygen, I need to get out of here.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.520]   It didn't happen often,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.640]   but I can recount four or five times in my career
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.400]   that I pushed myself to that level
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.280]   where I thought I was gonna maybe go out,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.800]   but every step I was dizzy.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.120]   But once I got to that door,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.240]   I was able to open it and go out,
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.160]   and grab the water,
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.360]   and get cold water in my face.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.240]   So no, I never really was able to do that.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.320]   And I think the story is in a book
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.800]   where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.640]   - Made you proud.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.560]   - Oh my gosh, and she didn't win.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.600]   But she pushed a collapse.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.880]   Now, did she suffer because of that?
[00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.420]   Well, she didn't get to go to the next event
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.260]   'cause she had to qualify.
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.900]   But I think it probably helped her too,
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.780]   realizing because she was winning the race,
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.260]   and she was beating people she normally never pushed,
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.800]   but she was at a new level that she had never been before,
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.740]   and she only needed about five feet to finish.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.100]   And it was just one of those things
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.340]   that I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there.
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:37.480]   And it probably made her realize that she could be better.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.040]   But she had to hold up though.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.620]   - So you mentioned in "Wrestling Life"
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.380]   that the Brands brothers looked up to Roy Salger,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.620]   who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.740]   but not getting too rough.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.220]   So how do you find the line
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.660]   between extreme physical wrestling,
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.180]   but at the same time,
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.940]   not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.140]   So that line between aggression,
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.340]   tough wrestling, and anger.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.180]   - Well, I think anger would cause
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.780]   less successful wrestling.
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.980]   I think anger would cause you to make mistakes
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.340]   and actually get out of position.
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.660]   Because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:27.660]   And there can be a furious type of attack,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:35.100]   but I think if it crosses the line to anger,
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.700]   then you're gonna be vulnerable.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   And so, Royce and the Brands
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.740]   wrestled to the edge, through the edge,
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.580]   but when the whistle blew, they stopped.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.820]   And there's people that,
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.820]   when the whistle blows, they keep going.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.420]   It's like in a football game,
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.860]   a fight breaks out and it's after the whistle's blown.
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.180]   Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.420]   So that whistle was something that, in a match,
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:18.140]   that kind of gave them the boundaries.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.460]   - But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.660]   So in "Wrestling Tough,"
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.140]   the book that you just got from Mike Chapman,
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.540]   the new edition, talks about Bill Cole,
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.780]   undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:33.180]   And how he talked about how my strength,
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.220]   speed, and ability to think were increased tremendously
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.460]   by just sitting apart from the action prior to the match
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.940]   and getting into a state of controlled anger.
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.140]   So can anger-- - Controlled anger.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.020]   - Controlled.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.780]   So anger could be fuel as long as it's controlled.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.060]   - Right, exactly.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.780]   You had that line.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.940]   One side of the line, you can have an anger for performance,
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.580]   and the other side of the line,
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.780]   if you go beyond that, it's not gonna be for performance.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:05.060]   It's gonna be for not performance,
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.580]   'cause you're gonna lose points.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.580]   It's a fine line.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.620]   There's definitely a fine line.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.460]   You're talking about Roy Seliger.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.060]   You're talking about Tom Brands.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.860]   You're talking about Terry Brands.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.700]   I mean, you got world championship titles there.
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.420]   You got Olympic championship title there.
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.420]   You got a world silver medalist in Roy Seliger.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.740]   And when I talked to him about the world silver medalist,
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:32.100]   he's haunted by that.
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.260]   'Cause he was actually 20 seconds away from winning
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.940]   when he got beat in the end there,
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.580]   but that's part of the game.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   And I don't know whether he's okay with it or not
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.900]   'cause he says, after talking about things,
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.460]   he goes, "I'm okay with it now."
[00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.500]   But then he keeps talking about it.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.000]   So I don't really think he's okay with it.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.900]   And it's hard for him to actually make amends to himself
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.660]   when you really don't do it.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.860]   I mean, no matter what the situation,
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.460]   even with the Owings loss.
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.140]   - Yeah, it still eats it.
[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.940]   - I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.340]   He's not, and he wanted to be.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.660]   I'm Olympic champion.
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.100]   He's not, and he wanted to be.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.180]   - One of the greatest coaches of all time.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.340]   And so he, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:30.300]   Because you don't get over those things.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.380]   So Royce really keeps going back to it
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.880]   even though he says he's fine.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.100]   But then he realizes he's really not fine
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.580]   because that's just the nature of the game.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.220]   And that's why he was able to win national titles
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.360]   and make world teams and stuff like that.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.220]   What's interesting about him,
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.260]   he's analyzed all the people that he's wrestled.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.700]   And a lot of them have won World and Olympic Championships.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.580]   And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.540]   And he didn't get to that world championship gold
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.340]   or Olympic gold.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.040]   And that, he says it because they did it.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.940]   So he's showing people that I've beaten those guys.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:18.100]   But apparently he didn't beat them at the right time.
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.620]   And so it still haunts him.
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.540]   You don't get away from that stuff.
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.340]   I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.260]   I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.500]   I mean, you think I'm ever gonna get over
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.580]   the murder of my sister?
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.140]   And you might not even know that.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.080]   - Let me pause for a second, please.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.500]   You've talked about it, you've written about it.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:44.140]   So I hope it's okay for me to say that your sister,
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.020]   your older sister, on May 31st, 1964,
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.100]   was raped and murdered by a local boy.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.540]   So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day,
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:59.820]   do they ripple through your life still?
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.500]   Through your wrestling, through your coaching,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.380]   through the way you, when you wake up in the morning?
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.740]   What is that like? - Yeah.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:14.580]   It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:20.460]   And it can be the mood I'm in.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.660]   You know, it can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.380]   or maybe if I've had a Gable beer.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:28.220]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:33.780]   Or maybe if you turn the country music up
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.800]   a little bit loud.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.380]   You know, emotions come out.
[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.300]   And everybody has them in their life.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.700]   It just so happens, you know, what brings it out?
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.340]   And hopefully it's nothing that you do
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.460]   to the extreme point of to where it brings it out.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.100]   For me, it's not extreme.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.660]   I don't have to have any of that, really.
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:56.940]   I can get emotional.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.540]   - How did that change you as a man?
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:05.540]   - What it did was realize that I was already
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.060]   pretty well developed.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.260]   Because I was only a sophomore, 15 years old,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.860]   in high school.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.860]   And I had parents that weren't making it.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.620]   And my parents are a lot older than me.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.140]   And now that we're down just to me and my parents,
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.940]   and I'm gonna be around the house for another two years,
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:30.420]   and they had just lost a daughter
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.140]   that was the only other sibling,
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.900]   they weren't handling it.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.900]   They were the ones that were suffering much more than me,
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.860]   even though I always look back upon one area
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.740]   that I wasn't good at was communication at that time,
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.280]   except inside the restroom, 'cause I had been tipped off.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.260]   And-- - Tipped off,
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.480]   what do you mean?
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.580]   - Well, the neighbor boy said that something to me
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.020]   about my sister just three weeks before that,
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:08.020]   that really wasn't normal or practical.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.860]   And I said nothing to nobody.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:15.160]   - You don't, is there a part of you that blames yourself?
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.260]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.380]   Absolutely.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:26.280]   But I'm 15 years old, and you make mistakes.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.940]   And you don't really act on everything
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.400]   that happens in your life.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.980]   But I can tell you how it affected me.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.180]   And I acted a lot on anything
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.540]   that maybe wasn't even of that consequence.
[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.060]   I mean, 'cause I had four daughters,
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.780]   and I'm telling you, when they left every time
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.580]   to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace,
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.800]   I always said something to 'em.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.860]   And they would always say, "Dad, you said that last night."
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:51.700]   I don't care.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.100]   - What, like I love you, or like be careful?
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.380]   - I'd say like, don't be driving and drinking,
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:59.620]   or don't be in a car with somebody
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.080]   that's of the same nature.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.300]   Or stay out of trouble.
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.700]   Don't go be somewhere where you have,
[00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.100]   I said, "You know how to get out of a car
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.400]   "if your car goes into the river?"
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:16.000]   You know, I just, I'm always thinking ahead a little bit,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.340]   just in case if something did happen.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.100]   And it goes back to that walk to school
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.140]   with that young man, when he was talking to me.
[00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.460]   And I just, I took it and I kept it inside me.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.480]   And once I found out she had been murdered,
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:37.020]   it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes,
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.900]   and I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.620]   And he looked at me and he just like,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.060]   he slapped me actually.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.300]   He pushed me against the car.
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.420]   He didn't slap me, he pushed me against the car.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.780]   My mom slaps me.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.300]   She was the one that slapped me around a little bit.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.020]   But my dad, he pushed me against the car.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.860]   He goes, "What do you mean you might know
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.380]   "something about this?"
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:59.700]   I said, "Dad, I don't for sure,
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.380]   "but," and we were probably all crying,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.400]   but, and I don't, I doubt if I was crying yet.
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.520]   I've probably cried a lot of tears since,
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   but I just said, "Hey, I was walking to school
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.880]   "with this neighbor and I never had walked
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   "to school with him before."
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.840]   And he was kind of a troubled kid.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good,
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.680]   but I didn't, he goes, "Why didn't you say something?"
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.040]   I said, "Dad, I just boy talk."
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.240]   So, and so he hugged me.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.560]   He hugged me.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.640]   And it was one of these things that,
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.640]   it's definitely made me a lot of who I am,
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.920]   because there's been a lot of choices.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.080]   And I don't, I took the word choice out of my life.
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.320]   And I just like to say, "Okay, do the right thing.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.560]   "Do the thing that you should do."
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.160]   And so I don't really, it's like,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.520]   "Are you gonna do this or this?"
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:45:59.360]   Well, what do you mean?
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.320]   Which one's better?
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.680]   Well, then I'm, so I don't have that choice.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.400]   Just give me the right way to go.
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.280]   And so, not that I've been perfect by any means,
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.880]   but it's made a big difference in my life
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.800]   on how I handle my life.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.400]   It's probably given me the opportunity
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.120]   to be married for 44 years.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.440]   It's just given me opportunities to be better in my life.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.840]   And I wanna thank my sister for that.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:33.520]   And I think my family was ready to make a split
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.160]   because of that incident.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   They were blaming each other.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.840]   And I think that I was able to help,
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.040]   but more than that, they really liked each other,
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.520]   but they didn't really know it at the time
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.480]   until I got out of the house.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.280]   Two years later, it probably was going on
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.920]   for a couple of years until I moved on and went to college.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.280]   Then they found out they really liked each other
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.480]   when they were alone and it worked out pretty good.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.040]   But I think them being able to follow me,
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.840]   not just through college and Olympics and Worlds,
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.160]   but my coaching.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.960]   So it's the same, the same success and factor,
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.280]   the excitement and all those things
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.960]   gave them a real purpose.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.760]   And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife,
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.200]   a real purpose to be able to be close
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.120]   to all these champions and championships.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:32.080]   And now it's like there's a family of 22
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.640]   and they're all interested in what we're interested in.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.400]   And it's going good, knock on wood.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.280]   But it's something that when all of a sudden
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.560]   you got too much time in your hands
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.720]   and you're not doing and accomplishing much,
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.040]   that things probably get off track.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.400]   - What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.000]   Can a man do it alone?
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.840]   And if not, where's family most important?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.640]   - You can do it alone, but why would you want to?
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.480]   - Yeah.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.040]   - I think the chances of doing it alone
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.080]   are much less than the chances of doing it together.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:10.280]   I know they say don't bring your profession home.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.660]   Sometimes they say that.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.040]   I never got away from my profession.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   And sometimes it's like my house right here.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.160]   So when I'm moving home,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.720]   I'm not gonna have an office
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.280]   'cause I'm not gonna coach anymore
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.800]   or I'm not gonna be an assistant athletic director
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.640]   for a while.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.360]   That you gotta do something
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   that gives you a little bit of a break.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.640]   Not you necessarily, maybe the person you're living with.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.320]   And so I don't know if you looked outside there,
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.840]   I got a cabin right out in my backyard.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.440]   You probably can't see it right there, but.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.800]   - What's in the cabin?
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.520]   - That's my house away from my house.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   It's only 30 feet from my house and it's my office.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.480]   And it's my workout room.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.520]   I got a sauna there.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.040]   It's a bed upstairs if I need it.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.320]   If I ever get too close and she says,
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.520]   "Hey, why don't you go sleep in the other house?"
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:07.480]   But she kicks me out of the bed.
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.320]   - Get the heck out.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.200]   - It's never happened.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.640]   But I do spend a lot of time out there.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.760]   You gotta have a little distance sometimes.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.960]   You gotta know your role.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.440]   And so all of a sudden when you're a guy
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.800]   that's been gone your whole life
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.400]   from eight o'clock in the morning
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.440]   till close to seven, 30 or eight o'clock at night.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.400]   So 11, 12 hours a day.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.960]   Then all of a sudden you're not gone as much.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.960]   Even though you still work.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.160]   She's trying to slow me down now.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:35.040]   I'm doing not so much like here what we're doing right now,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.360]   but it's when I get in the car and drive somewhere
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.240]   or fly somewhere.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.880]   Like just last night I just went to bed
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:43.200]   and I hadn't told her that this guy called me
[00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:45.680]   and he wants me to speak for,
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.760]   he wanna build another,
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.720]   Wrestling wants to start another
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.400]   Wrestlers in Business Networking out in Delaware.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.880]   Because we don't have any colleges
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.360]   in wrestling in Delaware.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.640]   And so I said, "Well, I'm glad to do that
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.880]   "'cause that's my life."
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.640]   But then all of a sudden,
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.040]   I didn't say anything to my wife
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.200]   until all of a sudden this morning.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.760]   And I told her that I might go
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.280]   on the Friday, the 21st of December.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:12.440]   - Oh no.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.760]   - Well, I said, "That's not Christmas."
[00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.440]   She goes, "We're celebrating Christmas that weekend early
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.120]   "because a lot of the family can't be here
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.480]   "except for that weekend."
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.080]   And I said, "Oh, well, that's not gonna work."
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.600]   But I kind of didn't say anything to her at first.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.440]   And then, well, I tell you,
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.680]   she started getting a little emotional.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:36.960]   And if I wanna stay married for another year, 45 years,
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   then I better tell those people
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.360]   that I got family obligations
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:48.040]   because it depends what's most important.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   I love wrestling.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.240]   I love wrestling.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.680]   And I wanna start another,
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.040]   help start another wrestlers and business network.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.920]   But there's more than one Dan Gable out there.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.760]   Well, maybe not.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.440]   But there's a lot of people that are maybe even closer.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.080]   And they got big names.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.800]   I mean, we're doing pretty well right now.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.600]   I mean, we got first two years ago
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.360]   and we got second this year.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.160]   And then we got the women's freestyles
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.640]   doing good in wrestling.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.840]   We gotta work a little bit on our Greco yet,
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.280]   but they are working on it.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   But our men's freestyle team right now are excellent.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:30.560]   And the key for them is to get them all on the same page
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:36.000]   instead of just have new highlights.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.400]   And by that, I'm saying,
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.120]   who you look and see who won this year.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.240]   Well, the three guys that have never won before
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.080]   won this year.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.280]   We had three world champions.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:48.080]   Our two past world champions didn't win this year.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:50.160]   I mean, they did okay.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.360]   They got medals.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.840]   - Did Burroughs win?
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.160]   - No, he did not.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.520]   He got third.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.360]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.200]   He got bronze, yeah.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.120]   - And Sajalive got, I mean, Snyder got second.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.800]   So those two are our main guys.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.840]   So the three new guys that came through
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.760]   were guys that hadn't won world gold.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.400]   In fact, two of them had never made a world team before.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.200]   And so we have three world champions this year,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.240]   but we needed all five of them to come through
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.440]   to win the championships.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.920]   And so the key really is getting them all
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:25.680]   to do the same at the same time, year in and year out,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.480]   and not just based on, okay, Burroughs got beat this year,
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.160]   so he'll win next year.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.680]   It's gotta be every year if you're capable of doing that.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.760]   And that's what the coaching staff has to do.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.000]   What's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.960]   actually on the coaching staffs right now at the USA level
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.760]   because the women's freestyle guy is Terry Steiner,
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.080]   and he wrestled for me and was a national champion.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:52.240]   He's got a twin brother that's at Fresno State.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.560]   And then Billy Zadig is the freestyle coach,
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.400]   and he wrestled for the Hawkeyes back in the early days,
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.040]   and he was the national champion.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.280]   So we got a lot of former Gable influence on there,
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.840]   but it's- - You got deep roots in there.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.120]   In 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC,
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.480]   voted wrestling out of the Olympics.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.280]   So a lot of folks know about this,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.020]   the absurdity of it, and so on.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.440]   But in a big picture, you can step back now,
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.480]   it's five years later.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.800]   What did you learn from that experience?
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.120]   - Well, first of all, did it surprise me?
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.480]   But did it really surprise me?
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.320]   No.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:41.840]   You gotta run, you gotta have people running
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.920]   the organization that are top-notch.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.380]   If you take anything for granted,
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.840]   and you're not the person of authority,
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.500]   somebody can kick you out.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.240]   And even though we had a lot of authority
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.660]   because we're wrestling,
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.400]   we're one of the first sports in the Olympics ever,
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   and that we think that we're in 180-some countries,
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   and some of the number one countries in the world
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:22.400]   that are politically strong have the sport.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.440]   You know, we thought we were okay.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.200]   But then you gotta look and see who's running the IOC.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:31.160]   The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.680]   - Yeah.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.880]   - And then you gotta see that, in wrestling,
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.640]   we don't have anybody in there.
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.380]   I mean, that shocked me.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.840]   We've never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.000]   You know why?
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.600]   Because we didn't have to.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.400]   But yes, that's wrong.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.920]   You have to.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:55.600]   And if you don't have somebody looking out for you
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.320]   right within the structure,
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.240]   then it's pretty easy for people to turn their head.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   But all it took was the statement,
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.720]   "You guys are kicked out of the Olympics.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:09.740]   You guys are done."
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.460]   - Everybody came together, woke up.
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.680]   - Well, yeah, I mean, it's the first time in ever,
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.060]   in history, that probably all this competitive people
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.860]   that were working for their own agenda
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:25.360]   turned that agenda to the sport.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.000]   So that made a big difference, and we got a lot done.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   In fact, in America, there was several people
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:40.420]   that were really out there that we didn't know about
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.580]   until this point in time.
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.540]   And when they came aboard, now they're still aboard.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:50.300]   That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect,
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.220]   because just because we got voted back in
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.660]   before we even got kicked out, really,
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.460]   that doesn't mean we're by any means safe.
[00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:00.940]   We have to do some of the things that I'm talking about,
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.780]   or some of the things that we didn't do before.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:06.460]   We can't fall right back into the same mess.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:11.420]   And so our leadership got changed, and it's better,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.340]   but it's gotta stay better.
[00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:17.980]   But there are things that we could still be doing
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.740]   to make sure that we don't have situations like this happen.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.580]   I'll tell you, when I first learned about it,
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:28.020]   I was like, I broke down and wept.
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:29.100]   - Yeah. - Again.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   It's like every once in a while,
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:35.100]   I'll break down and cry about my sister.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.540]   Or I'll break down, I don't know if I cry
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.100]   about losing the O-ings, but I probably get more determined.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.220]   But that's kind of, you have to go back
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.820]   and think about those moments when you heard.
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:52.820]   When I heard that moment, and I, it just overcame me.
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:56.820]   It was like 4 o'clock, 4.30 in the morning
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:57.660]   when I heard about it.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.420]   And my wife had been up looking at the internet,
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.020]   and she woke me up, and I thought she was joking.
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:05.620]   But I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that.
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.100]   I knew she was serious.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:10.700]   And I started making phone calls right then
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:11.980]   to find out if it was true.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.340]   And when I found out it was true,
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.740]   it was just like devastating.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:20.180]   It was one of these things that, it's a nightmare.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.060]   And, but you don't let it happen again.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.060]   It's that simple.
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.700]   - Yeah, and you keep getting stronger.
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.100]   - Yeah.
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.380]   And if people haven't read, they should read
[00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.620]   "The Loss of Dan Gable" by Ray Thompson, the ESPN article.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:37.020]   They kind of, in this very beautiful poetic way,
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:42.860]   ties together all the losses of Dan Gable,
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.580]   the losing your sister, losing to Larry O-ings,
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.700]   losing wrestling from the Olympics,
[00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.280]   all of these tragedies of various forms.
[00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:57.980]   So that's the IOC, there's politics,
[00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.100]   and you're sort of being very pragmatic.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.500]   But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.940]   of combat, period.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.580]   Dating back, there's cave drawings, 15,000 years ago.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.620]   And if you look at the ancient Olympics,
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:13.900]   the Greek Olympics, 2,700 years ago,
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.340]   did you ever, when you wrestled or coached,
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.620]   do you now see wrestling in this way,
[00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:22.540]   of freestyle and folk style wrestling,
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.580]   the purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat,
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:30.380]   the roots of that, us as just human beings,
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.420]   this fair struggle between two men or two women?
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:37.500]   - I don't think I ever looked at it
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:43.340]   as anything but just a combat.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:48.340]   And I think there's times that have made me
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.280]   figure out how to make that combat better.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:58.180]   There's little markers or little points in time
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:01.660]   in your life that make you wonder,
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:05.640]   or I should say determined,
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:10.820]   to be able to get more out of yourself
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.060]   and to be able to take it to a new level.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.420]   And I don't think people can actually feel that way
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:20.380]   unless you've actually had a lot of accomplishments,
[00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.340]   in anything, I think there's anything out there.
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.020]   I mean, no matter what sport
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.260]   or breaking the four-minute mile.
[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.500]   I mean, when they broke that,
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.580]   Roger Bannister broke that four-minute mile,
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.260]   I can't imagine him breaking it
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.100]   from his best time being 4.30.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.460]   You know, it's one of these things that,
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:44.460]   along the line, that he did had some close calls,
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.980]   or he had some coaching that was giving him
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   the opportunity to become a little better.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.460]   But I think because he was doing well
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.460]   and being very successful, that the opportunity came.
[00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.740]   And so it's for me, it's like the same thing.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.940]   I had so much success
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:08.460]   and so many practices that went well,
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.060]   and so much goodness out of this sport
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.740]   that it gave me the opportunity
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:21.420]   to really look more finite
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.900]   and look more how I could even make it better.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.740]   And so it's like, if you look at my library upstairs,
[01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:29.500]   I got a library upstairs,
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:35.840]   and there's a lot of books up there from the family.
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.080]   But if you look at the Gable books up there,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.380]   I got a lot of Russian technique books.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.260]   (Lex laughing)
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:48.580]   I can't read the book, but I can see the diagrams,
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:52.140]   and I can see the figures.
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.220]   They don't really show it in pictures.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.760]   They do it in drawings.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:01.420]   And so it was like when I was trying to beat the best,
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.020]   that is labeled the best,
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.140]   because they win the world championships every year
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:09.940]   since they've been just about involved.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.420]   And I don't think they got started involved
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.500]   until like the '50s,
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:18.340]   but it's something, you study the best who's out there,
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.700]   but then you don't focus so much on the best
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.740]   that you can't beat the best.
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.600]   You learn from them,
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.860]   but there's something that they don't have
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.980]   that you can have.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.660]   - Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.700]   - Yeah, all that stuff.
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.420]   And that's why even talking to you
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.740]   and you're sitting over there and you love MIT
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.940]   and you're bragging about it over Harvard.
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.660]   - 'Cause it's true.
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.300]   - In your eyes, and that's great, and it might be,
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.100]   but it's the same type of thing
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.700]   that there's something that you're probably stealing
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.100]   from Harvard, but you won't give them credit.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:03.740]   - Well, Dan, in the interest of time,
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.220]   I've read that you're pretty serious.
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.980]   You're pretty seriously into fishing.
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.140]   So what's the biggest fish you ever caught?
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.820]   What are we talking about here?
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.020]   Are we talking about--
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:22.140]   - No, I don't think I've ever caught a big ocean fish.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.140]   I'm a river lake fisherman.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.100]   I have-- - Bass, trout?
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.020]   - No, probably northern.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:33.400]   I probably caught a northern that weighed 20-some pounds.
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.620]   The fish I like to catch is walleyes.
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.380]   And the reason why I like to catch 'em
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.780]   'cause they're really good eating fish.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.340]   And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.820]   It's kinda interesting.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.100]   I got people hunting deer right on my land
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.300]   and they're looking for the big bucks,
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.900]   but they're not the best eaters if you wanna eat,
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.300]   but they're the best trophy.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.500]   So I do have a couple of trophy walleyes on the wall,
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:03.100]   but most of the time I throw the big ones back
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.060]   and put 'em back in there.
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.340]   I don't know if you know there's a book by Hemingway
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.420]   called "Old Man and the Sea."
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.260]   - Heard of it.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:12.060]   - And-- - Ernest Hemingway?
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.780]   - Ernest Hemingway, yeah.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:18.780]   And there's an old man that basically catches an 18-footer,
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:20.660]   but can't pull it in, doesn't have the strength,
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.420]   so they together spend while the sharks eat away at it.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:26.620]   I mean, this is a very powerful story.
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.900]   I think won him the Nobel Prize.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:31.700]   But he says, "It's better to be lucky," the old man says.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.820]   "It's better to be lucky, but I would rather be exact."
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.740]   That way, when luck comes, you're ready.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:43.300]   So let me ask, what do you think about luck?
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:47.180]   Do you believe in free will, that we have actions
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.980]   that control the direction, destination of our life?
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:53.620]   Or does luck and some other outside forces
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:56.780]   really land you where you end up?
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:00.500]   - For me, I'm not about luck.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.980]   But I do think there is, luck is involved.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.740]   But I think it's mostly created,
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:11.060]   just how lucky you are through preparations.
[01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:14.960]   And things have happened in my life forever,
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.380]   and a lot of good things.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.540]   And a lot of people could say,
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.820]   "Hey, you've been pretty lucky to win all these awards."
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:27.220]   I don't know, if you analyze my life,
[01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:29.860]   I don't think it was involved with luck.
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.100]   I think it was more involved with preparation.
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.140]   And again, science, had you been smarter,
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:39.860]   had you understood that you could do some things
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.040]   and be just as lucky, that'd be great.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.140]   But I'm only as smart as today.
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.320]   So when I was training in my life,
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.300]   and me even training people in my life,
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.900]   as of that moment, that's how lucky I am
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:59.900]   to be able to have whatever is available to me.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.900]   And that's what, you call that a lot of science.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.900]   So for me, I think that, like right now, if I look back,
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.340]   I do a lot of things different,
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.740]   just because things are proven differently.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:17.380]   Like I give people water during practice, and I did.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.100]   And I would let them change their wrestling shoes
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.600]   into running shoes to run sprints on the concrete.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.740]   Or I would actually, maybe I've had a guy
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.380]   climb 12 ropes after practice, one after another.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.460]   And then maybe the next day I'd do it again.
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.220]   I might not make him do it the next day.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.180]   I might let him recover a little bit more.
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.180]   And you gotta learn, keep adding to your philosophy.
[01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.540]   And your philosophy may have been great at that time,
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.460]   but it's at that time.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.380]   And what is really important is
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.880]   where are you at with this time, today?
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.360]   And so there's better ways to do things.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.000]   Now, if you ever take attitude out of it
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   and just depend on total science,
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   then you're not gonna be as,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.680]   I think as I listened to a couple people
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.600]   that are really pretty famous people.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.040]   One of them was John Irving.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.040]   He was a writer.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.360]   And he told me, he says,
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.120]   "You think I really learned how to be a great writer
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.680]   in writing school?"
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.640]   I said, "Yeah, I learned a lot there."
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.640]   But really what gave me the ability to stay focused,
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.680]   to work extra hours, to be more disciplined
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.300]   was wrestling practices.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.240]   (Lex laughing)
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.800]   - That's right, he was a wrestler, yeah.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.720]   - Yeah, he goes, "I go back to that.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.560]   That's what gave me that chance."
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.120]   You know, and there's a guy in Iowa,
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.480]   a guy named Norman Borlaug.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:58.580]   He invented a process to feed
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.420]   the underprivileged countries of the world.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:06.680]   And he was a wrestler and he said the same thing.
[01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.720]   And he worked extremely hard.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.200]   And he said, "I give a lot of credit
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.080]   to the sport of wrestling.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.400]   And even though I'm known for this
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.360]   and I got a statue in Washington, DC
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.860]   because I saved a billion lives plus,
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.800]   I'm gonna give wrestling a lot of credit."
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.800]   So, you know, I think some of these MMA stars
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.940]   and some of these guys that maybe weren't wrestlers
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:36.760]   that had to wrestle, had to fight wrestling guys and stuff
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.280]   missed a little bit there.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.560]   But I think the ones that did have wrestling
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.920]   probably have a really good chance
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.480]   and can adapt to the other ones.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.320]   But I think every martial art or every activity is good
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.800]   and you probably can't skip any.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.920]   But I don't think they're ever gonna overlook
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.080]   and say that wrestling's pretty not,
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.720]   or not valuable because it is.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.560]   However, that doesn't mean you're gonna make it.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.400]   You still gotta take the values and apply it
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.320]   whatever area you're gonna be in.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.400]   And some people forget that.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.200]   Some people can't get over the highness
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.400]   of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.440]   And you know what?
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.080]   What's even greater than me getting my arm raised
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.320]   is that if I'm a coach or if I was in "Belong With You"
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.520]   that you get your arm raised.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.360]   And even if you don't get your arm raised
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.200]   it's what you walk away with
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.840]   and how you learn to handle that as well.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   Because there's gonna be some losses,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.040]   but you don't want many.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.560]   'Cause you don't wanna get used to losing.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.520]   I can tell you that.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.240]   - So it's the hunger for the win.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.320]   It's the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.960]   And it's hard work and science
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:49.920]   that's gonna beat luck at the end of the day.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.120]   - Absolutely, that luck.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.600]   I like luck, but I think it's created
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.880]   by the opportunity that--
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   - You make your luck.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.120]   - You make your luck, yeah.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.960]   - Dan, it was a huge honor.
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.840]   Thank you for welcoming me into your home
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.080]   and for having this conversation.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.240]   - Yeah, no problem.
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.840]   Good man.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.400]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation with Dan Gable.
