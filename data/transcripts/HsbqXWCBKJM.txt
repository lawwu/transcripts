[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Well, can Christlike virtues survive in a cutthroat technology sector like in Silicon
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.360]   Valley?
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   It's a great question from a listener named Bill.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.400]   "Dear Pastor John, recently the Wall Street Journal published an article titled, 'At
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.420]   Netflix, Radical Transparency and Blunt Firings Unsettle the Ranks.'
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.520]   The article detailed the culture at Netflix in which high transparency and bluntness in
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.240]   firings are virtues to be upheld in high regard.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.720]   It's a type of social Darwinism in that only the fittest survive.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.080]   Fear of firings becomes a strong motivator to ensure short-term successes.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080]   Netflix is not the only company to rid themselves of underperformers.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.640]   Amazon, Facebook, and Apple come to mind too.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.280]   In light of the biblical priority on grace, humility, servant leadership, kindness, gentleness,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.160]   and many other qualities, how can a Christian exhibit such character qualities in a culture
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.640]   that perceives them as professional weaknesses?
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.560]   And how do they harm our witness?
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   I live and work in Silicon Valley and would greatly appreciate your help."
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:20.120]   Let me begin to address this huge issue with an anecdote from my own ministry.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.480]   In the early days of my pastorate, the issue arose concerning musicians who were making
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.200]   mistakes in public worship back in the early '80s.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.000]   One leader put a heavy stress on the need for excellence.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.680]   The Lord deserves excellence and suggested that if somebody messes up, he should or she
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.040]   should not be used in worship services musically anymore.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.600]   Now, I responded to this by affirming the pursuit of excellence but adding two qualifications.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.440]   I said, "First, excellence is a category that is moral as well as musical, and so we
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.280]   should strive to be excellent in forgiveness and patience as well as excellent in technical
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.800]   musicality."
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.040]   The other thing I said was that there is a kind of excellence that can be just as disruptive
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.920]   to God-centered worship as musical flaws.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.980]   I pointed, for example, to a kind of piano solo during the offering where the keyboard
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.440]   flourishes are so off the charts amazing—you know, you can picture a person going, "Blah,
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.760]   blah, blah," up and down the keyboard, you know?—so off the charts amazing that they
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.760]   draw all attention to the skill of the pianist, not God-centered reverence of the moment.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.340]   There was no technical flaw in the performance, which is exactly the right word and the wrong
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.080]   attitude, but the ministry mindset of the moment was profoundly flawed.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.540]   It was flawed; it wasn't excellent.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.600]   It was a distracting excellence.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.760]   So we tried to put all this together with a leadership philosophy of God-centered,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.020]   undistracting, merciful excellence.
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.280]   Three key adjectives—God-centered, undistracting, merciful excellence.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now the reason I share this anecdote is to acknowledge that there is a real inevitable
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.880]   tension between the demands of excellence or competence in needed skills, on the one
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   hand, whether it's church or industry, and the demands of mercy, kindness, gentleness,
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.840]   humility, servanthood, love, on the other hand.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.060]   So let me support this from the Bible, and then we'll see how the tension is handled.
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.720]   On the one hand, we read, "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.440]   also," Matthew 5:39.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:26.260]   And we read, "Forgive a repentant offender seventy-seven times," Matthew 18:21.
[00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.160]   We read, "Love your enemies and do good to those who hate you.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.540]   Bless those who curse you," Luke 6:27.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.560]   We read, "Admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak, be patient with
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.960]   them all," 1 Thessalonians 5:14.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:56.040]   In other words, we are told to treat others not merely according to what they deserve—not
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.480]   according to their competencies and performances—better than they deserve.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.760]   We have received freely, we should give freely, we have been forgiven by Christ, we should
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.040]   forgive others.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.120]   That's huge, and that's the question being posed is, "Okay, what do I do with that
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.600]   in the workplace?"
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.160]   Now, what we don't often realize is that, on the other hand, the New Testament teaches
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:33.000]   that there are at least five spheres of life—spheres of life—where justice shapes the form of
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.840]   love along with the shaping power of mercy.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.040]   Let me give these five examples.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.240]   For example, in the sphere of the family, Paul does not tell parents to turn the other
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:53.080]   cheek when children disobey, but to discipline them in the Lord.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.800]   That may be right at times for a parent to turn the other cheek to teach something, to
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.200]   illustrate something about mercy, but not usually.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.040]   Love calls for not turning the other cheek so that children can be brought up in the
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.160]   discipline of the Lord.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   So there's one sphere where turning the other cheek is not the only way that love
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   shows itself.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.400]   Number two, the sphere of the church.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.240]   It is right that there be forgiveness, but this does not exclude the proper use of church
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.600]   discipline, which may involve excommunication of somebody from the church.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.680]   It also does not exclude the demand that elders have certain qualifications for teaching and
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   governing, and if they fall short of those qualifications, they are not allowed to be
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   elders.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.200]   You don't turn the other cheek to an elder who can't teach and say, "Oh, we'll let
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.520]   you teach anyway because that's—you'll make you feel better."
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.640]   That's not the way love functions at the eldership level or even at the membership
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.240]   level.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.560]   Number three, the sphere of government.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.120]   Policemen do not protect society mainly by turning the other cheek when criminals assault
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120]   people.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.560]   1 Peter 2:4 says, "Governors exist to reward the good and punish the evil."
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.080]   Sphere number four, business.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:35.200]   No economic order can function where there is pervasive cheating and deception and contract
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.480]   breaking and fraud and corruption and stealing.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:45.000]   Those sorts of things will bring ruin to an economy and result in anarchy and probably
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200]   the result of a dictatorship.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   Proverbs 11:1 says, "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.200]   is his delight."
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.520]   And when Jesus told the parable of the talents, which is the sum of money to be invested,
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:12.960]   the slothful employee who squandered his business possibilities with his talent is removed and
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.640]   called wicked and slothful.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:23.840]   Matthew 25, 26, "You wicked, slothful servant, you ought to have invested my money, you incompetent,
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.680]   you know, slothful person.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.000]   You ought to have invested my money with bankers, and at my coming I should have received at
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.160]   least interest.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.920]   You should have had that much competence."
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.680]   Sphere number five, education.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:46.800]   Jesus refuses to give any answer to a person who tries to answer his questions the way
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.800]   they do in Matthew 21, 23 following.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.760]   He does not give to him who asks.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.120]   In one place he says, "Give to him who asks."
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.360]   Well, in this case, Jesus does not give to him who asks.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   He will not educate those who simply try to manipulate language to avoid trouble.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:15.840]   I mean, two plus two is not five, and any manipulative effort to get a good grade for
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.000]   saying it is five is rejected by Jesus, not rewarded.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.440]   So you don't give an A to a person who gets all of his answers wrong just because it will
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.400]   make him feel better and that's a more kind and gentle and patient and forgiving things
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   to do.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.320]   So here's my conclusion, and my answer to Bill's question.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:43.840]   Christians are people who bear witness to both of these realities, both the justice
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:53.280]   and the mercy of God, requiring appropriate competence in certain spheres, but also mingling
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.520]   mercy and patience.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:06.280]   Our aim is to show that in this world, both justice and mercy are forms of love.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:15.120]   It's right to insist on competence while also being patient with everyone.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:23.160]   Now if that sounds imprecise and attention and complicated, it is.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   I mean, parenting with mercy and discipline, doing church discipline with mercy and holiness,
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:39.800]   governing with a billy club and kindness, educating with the necessary standards and
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:47.560]   patience, doing business with competency and compassion, none of this is precise.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:55.320]   This is why our minds—I'm thinking of Romans 12 here—this is why our minds must
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   be transformed in the renewing of them so that we can be saturated with the Word of
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.320]   God and led by the Spirit.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.840]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.760]   And Bill, thanks for the excellent question.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.920]   If you work inside a high-pressure business world, what challenges do you face?
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   Tell us, we'd like to know.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.600]   Email a question to us that we can address here on the podcast in the new year.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.360]   Send it to AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.120]   And speaking of 2019 drawing to a close, the end of the calendar year is a big time for
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.360]   us budget-wise here at Desiring God.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.240]   That's because almost 40% of our annual budget comes to us in December from our generous
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   ministry partners.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.520]   40% of our budget that it requires to fund our year-round work comes to us from donors
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.240]   in the last month of the year, and that month is almost over.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.640]   So if you've been blessed by the many resources we offer free of charge, like the Ask Pastor
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.400]   John podcast, would you consider donating to the ministry before December 31st?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.480]   In fact, you can do so right now at DesiringGod.org/give.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.920]   That's DesiringGod.org/give.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.440]   And so many of our ministry partners listen to this podcast, and I just want to say thank
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.160]   you for partnering with us in this ministry of labor.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.720]   You make this podcast possible, and I am deeply grateful to God for your donations and for
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.080]   your prayers over the many months and years that I've been at DG.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.600]   I am Tony Aranke.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.720]   We'll see you on Monday as we begin a little series addressing your great questions for
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.320]   Pastor John on Bible reading.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.760]   There's some great ones in the queue.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.800]   All new episodes beginning Monday with Pastor John.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.320]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.320]   [End]
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   1.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   What is the purpose of the Bible?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   2.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   What is the purpose of the Bible?
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.320]   3.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   What is the purpose of the Bible?
