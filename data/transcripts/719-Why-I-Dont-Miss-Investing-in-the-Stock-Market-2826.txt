[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.160]   I am your host and today we're going to talk about why I don't miss investing in the stock
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.160]   market.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920]   Now you should have a little bit of context though.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.320]   The reason why I think this is interesting is that I have for almost all of my adult
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.840]   life been invested in the stock market.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.900]   Not only that, I spent a significant amount of my career helping other people to invest
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.320]   in the stock market.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.560]   I've been a licensed securities broker.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.160]   I have managed money.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.680]   I have billed fees and charged fees based upon managing people's money.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.420]   And yet at the time of this recording of this show, I do not currently own any publicly
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420]   traded mutual funds.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.520]   I don't currently own any publicly traded securities.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.600]   Although I'll expand and share with you a little bit of some additional texture behind
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600]   that.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.160]   But today I want to talk about what I don't miss about investing in the stock market.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.280]   If we look back and we think about kind of where we are as a people, the stock market
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   is a big, big part of our lives.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560]   You know, right now, stock market up, down, every single way.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   It just seems like no matter how you go through it, every single day, there's more headlines
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.980]   and the stock market is driving almost everything.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.960]   And yet I become convinced the longer I've been a financial planner, that I become more
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   and more convinced that the stock market is not for everyone.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.820]   And so what I want to do in today's show is I want to share with you some details as to
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.880]   some of the ideas that I used to hold about in stock investing that I don't hold any longer,
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   as well as share with you kind of where I'm at.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.320]   And I need to just go ahead and give you the whole story from the beginning, which is fairly
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]   simple.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.160]   Right now, as I record this right now, I'm not sure where I'll wind up being over the
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   long term.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.960]   I'm not sure whether I'll wind up going back into the stock market or staying out of the
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.960]   stock market.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   I've been wrestling with that for quite a while, trying to think about different solutions.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.480]   What I have learned is this, and this is my basic thesis.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.740]   The more time that I spend out of the stock market, the less I miss it.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.020]   And the more excited I am about other opportunities.
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.760]   When I think about the other investment opportunities that I have and that you have, I become increasingly
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.860]   convinced that the stock market is really good at making investment advisors a lot of
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.220]   money, but it's not so good at making individual investors a lot of money.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.420]   Now I'm not going to make an extreme case in this show.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.100]   I'm not going to try to say, "Oh, you can't make any money in the stock market."
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.100]   Of course you can.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.100]   I'm not going to say that nobody should invest in the stock market.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.820]   You should sell it all and go buy timberland.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.220]   What I'm going to try to do is lay out more of my view, which is kind of a nuanced view,
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.380]   which comes down to the fact that the reason why you associate investing primarily with
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.660]   the stock market has more to do with the easy marketability of stocks than it does with
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.220]   the inherent benefits for you as an individual investor.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.140]   So here's what I've learned in my years of working as a financial advisor.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.140]   I started in 2008, so 12 years now as a financial advisor in some form or another.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.820]   I don't currently hold any investment advisory licenses.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.780]   I don't hold any securities licenses anymore.
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.700]   I abandoned all those things.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.020]   But I had all that stuff and I still consider myself a financial advisor, although I try
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.580]   to be a little bit thoughtful with how I use that term.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.060]   Simply due to follow the regulations.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.380]   I don't make suggestions to people to buy or sell securities.
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.180]   Here's what I've learned.
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.340]   Stocks are really easy to sell.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.020]   And they're really easy for me to make a living selling.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.420]   But when you actually pull back from that and you think about the whole broad scope
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:32.280]   of investment opportunities, you find that there are a lot more opportunities than most
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   people come in.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.580]   Usually over the years I've learned that I need to be very careful.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.260]   When I ask people about their 401k and what investments they have, they automatically
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.260]   think stock market.
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.420]   They automatically think, and let me even be specific because there are stock markets
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.420]   all around the world.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.060]   They automatically think US publicly traded securities, US stock market, the New York
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.140]   Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Stock Exchange.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.780]   They kind of automatically conflate this word investment to mean stock market.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.820]   And I believe that that is more due to, again, the influence of those of us who have worked
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.820]   in the securities business than it is to how individuals should think about it.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.220]   Sorry for all the disclaimers up front, but I do want to be cautious.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260]   I'm not mad at stockbrokers.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.380]   I'm not here to do an expose on the industry.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.380]   I have lots of friends who are stockbrokers.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.140]   I could probably be a stockbroker again in the future at some point in time.
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.380]   I have some ways that I've thought about that I think I could do that.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.360]   But what I want to do is just give you a little perspective on the subject.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.740]   Because when I say the word investment, I don't believe you should just automatically
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.900]   conflate that word investment with buying stocks.
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.540]   I think those should be different things and you should consider them differently.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.380]   Again, you can invest in almost anything.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.780]   I'll give you an example.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.120]   You can invest in an education.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.020]   You can and should invest in an education.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.380]   In fact, for most people, investing in your education is going to be the single best investment
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.820]   that you can make.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.220]   But here's another trap.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.900]   Notice that when I said invest in an education, you automatically thought invest in a college
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.540]   degree.
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.700]   Why did you think that?
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.060]   Well, you thought that because you've been effectively marketed to over the years by
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:26.460]   colleges, admissions advisors, your friends, your parents, advisors.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.860]   You've been marketed to by financial planning magazines that have said if you want to invest
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.300]   in your child, you should buy a college fund for them and you should fund it with stocks.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.300]   That's been marketed to you.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.940]   But all I said was invest in education.
[00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.580]   You can invest in your education in many ways.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.460]   For example, I invest in my education by reading books.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.940]   I invest in my education by taking seminars.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.340]   I invest in my education by hiring mentors and hiring coaches.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.140]   You can invest in your education by starting businesses and getting yourself in a situation
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.820]   where you say, "You know what?
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.580]   Even if it costs me a bunch of money, I'm going to go ahead and focus on starting something
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.020]   and learning from the process."
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.820]   You can invest in a marketing degree by going to college or you can go and start a business
[00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.260]   and invest in your marketing education by learning how to market your business effectively.
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.340]   Both of those, in my opinion, are really quality investments that you should, can, and should
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.340]   consider doing.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.860]   But when I say invest in your education, you think college.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.220]   Same reason when I say invest money, you think stocks.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.980]   Now what other ways could you invest though?
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.100]   The reason I started with invest in education is because most of the time, we would usually,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.660]   for thinking clearly, we would recognize that it's more important for you to invest in your
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.500]   education and building your earning skills than it is for you to buy stocks.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.300]   If I were presenting to you a 16-year-old who was making, I don't know, $8 an hour at
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.300]   some dead-end job, and they came to you and said, "I've saved $200.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.780]   What should I invest in?"
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.860]   You would never tell that 18-year-old, whatever age I said, you would never tell that young
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:05.820]   person that the secret of what you should do with your $200 is to go and buy a stock.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.260]   You would say, "You need to invest it into your earning ability.
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.660]   You need to invest it into yourself because that's a good investment."
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.140]   Now there could be other things that are worthy investments that give you financial returns
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.320]   but also give you lifestyle returns.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.180]   For example, let's say somebody doesn't have a car.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.700]   Well, they earn a little bit of money.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.240]   They save a little bit of money.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.980]   They should probably invest in a car or at the very least, probably invest in a bicycle
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.940]   because that vehicle might open up totally new earning possibilities to them.
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.780]   That vehicle might open up a totally better lifestyle for them.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.780]   Now what else?
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.140]   We talk about investing in your home, and that's perfectly reasonable.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.660]   That's perfectly adequate.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.300]   But that's just scratching the tip of the investments that are available.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.220]   So here's what came, what bothered me when I was a financial advisor.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.020]   I started to discover that I didn't have a lot of success stories of my clients becoming
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:06.100]   wealthy because they invested in my stocks that I sold them.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.420]   That bothered me.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:13.300]   What I realized is I was good at helping clients who were already wealthy invest their portfolios
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   effectively.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.460]   We put together a portfolio of mutual funds and I would say, "Listen, you've got a million
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.500]   dollars or you've got three million dollars or whatever you've got.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.020]   We'll help you invest that effectively."
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.700]   But I wasn't very good at helping them get rich.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:37.300]   That process brought me to believe that financial advisors and the financial advice industry
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:44.260]   is better at helping people who are rich stay rich and get a little bit richer without having
[00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:52.460]   to work every day and also helping people who, well that's it.
[00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.460]   That's what they're better at.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.060]   They're better at helping those people who are rich get a little richer and stay richer
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.620]   without having to work every day than they are at helping people who are not rich get
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:01.620]   rich.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:07.340]   I came to realize that when I looked at it, the two things that always happened that helped
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:14.620]   my clients to actually become rich was number one, they had a high income job and/or number
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.100]   two, they had a successful business.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.860]   Because if my clients could have a high income job, they could save money, put money in their
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.020]   401K and over a course of decades become millionaires or if they had a highly profitable business,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   they could have enough money either through income or through eventually selling the business
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.580]   that they were rich.
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:39.700]   But without those two things, without a high paying job or without a good business, people
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.020]   didn't really wind up becoming all that rich at least not through stock investing.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.780]   Now is that because it can't work, that it can't happen?
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   Certainly not.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.780]   It can work.
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.660]   You could have somebody, if you're a financial advisor, you could have a client that you
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.140]   start working with when the client is 22 years old, just came out of college, you open up
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.020]   a Roth IRA, they put a few thousand dollars in it and maybe if 40 years later you're still
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.520]   working with that client, they might have a million dollars, maybe.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.220]   But the realistic answer is you're probably not going to be working with that client 40
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.820]   years later because as a financial advisor, you're always upgrading your clients, you're
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:16.600]   always changing out your client base and you're moving up to wealthier clients who give you
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.540]   more opportunities for your business as a financial advisor.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.820]   So it's not that it can't work, it's just that it's not the most effective.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.780]   What you need is a high paying job and/or you need a business.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.980]   And that's why the number one prospecting pool for the vast majority of financial advisors,
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:37.940]   for most of us, is high income professionals and business owners because there's opportunity
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.940]   there.
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.580]   Well if that's the case, I think that we should spend a lot more time helping people to develop
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:49.380]   a high income and/or helping people to develop a profitable business than we do selling stocks.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.340]   But unfortunately the whole business is built on selling stocks.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.340]   So what's my personal experience with the stock market?
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.340]   Well the first thing is when I was 18 years old, I sat down on my 18th birthday and opened
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.060]   a Roth IRA and I bought a mutual fund.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.860]   I don't even know what mutual fund it was, I just bought a mutual fund.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.580]   And I was a nerd, I was really interested in financial advice, I was really interested
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.820]   in how I could become wealthy, I really wanted to become wealthy.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.060]   And so I sat down at an early age and I started reading the books.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.660]   I would read books on mutual fund investing and I started with the mainstream personal
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.780]   finance books.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:31.820]   I read, what's the one, Automatic Millionaire, I would read the Automatic Millionaire by
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.340]   David Bach when I was in high school.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:40.060]   Or I would read the Lazy Man's Guide to Investing, it's all about passive index fund investing.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.660]   I would read Jack Bogle's books and what I could find.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:50.260]   But mostly at the basic, what I call the personal finance, the consumer level of personal finance.
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.460]   And as a consumer I would put myself in a situation where I said, "Okay, the way I'm
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.660]   going to build wealth is I would buy mutual funds and I would put them in an IRA and I
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.060]   would make sure I fund that IRA."
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.940]   Well fast forward a number of years, in 2008 I started working as a financial advisor.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.700]   I started with getting insurance licenses, became an insurance salesman, selling life
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.980]   insurance, disability income insurance, long term care insurance.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.700]   Then I went ahead and got my securities licenses, a series six, and I forget all the numbers,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.900]   63, and then I later got a 65 and became a registered investment advisor representative
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.020]   or whatever it's called, it's a number of years ago.
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.100]   I wound up studying financial planning.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:30.060]   I had a certified financial planning designation, a chartered financial consultant.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.420]   I wound up getting a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.580]   I never did investment focused specific specialties.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.100]   I didn't become a chartered financial analyst.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.260]   I didn't spend time to get any of the specific investment management designations.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.260]   That was never my interest.
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.260]   I was always more interested in personal financial planning.
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.100]   But I passed the exams.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.660]   And generally I should know what I'm talking about.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.700]   I read a bunch of books on the subject.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.980]   I should know what I'm talking about.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.100]   Again, I used to manage portfolios.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.260]   Although I wasn't choosing what stocks were in them, I was just serving as an interface
[00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:06.780]   between clients and kind of the back end investment advisors for our firm.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.900]   Then I left the firm that I was with.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.420]   I surrendered all my securities licenses so that I could do what I'm doing right now,
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.060]   which is be a member of the media.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.500]   I became frustrated with trying to be locked behind a paywall where everything I had to
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.860]   say, sorry, a legal wall where everything I had to say had to go through a legal department.
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.300]   I had to be pre-approved.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:28.380]   The way that it works, if a financial advisor is going to do what I'm doing right now, the
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.020]   financial advisor has to write a script of everything they're going to say.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.300]   They send that script off to their legal department, get it approved by their legal department.
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.360]   The legal department says, "Okay, you can say this.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.360]   You can't say this.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.540]   You can adjust this."
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.140]   Then they go and they do the media appearance.
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.140]   They do the interview.
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.140]   They go on TV.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   They say what they're going to say.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.620]   Then afterwards, they get a recording.
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.700]   Then that recording all goes onto the company servers and has to be saved forever.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.500]   It's all kind of part of the deal because if you're going to be in the financial advice
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   industry and you're going to get the licenses, that's the deal you sign up for.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.300]   I didn't want that.
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.820]   I walked away from that business, got rid of all my licenses, surrendered everything.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:07.060]   I no longer have any licenses and haven't had any since about 2014.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.420]   Over the years, I've watched to see how I would change because even though I didn't
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:18.100]   have any licenses, I still had an intense degree of loyalty to the industry, to my comrades,
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.460]   to my friends who are advisors, to everything.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.420]   Over the years, that loyalty has kind of changed a little bit.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.540]   It's not that I don't have that sense of loyalty or that sense of affinity.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.500]   It's just that that's kind of a past life.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.380]   I haven't been involved in that in a very long time.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.940]   Because it's a past life, then I don't think about it much.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.220]   I don't worry about it much.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:43.500]   It's not something that I pay much attention to.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.780]   But in the present life, I have a little bit more perspective.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:54.260]   Over the years, as I've thought about it, I grew more and more dissatisfied with stock
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.260]   investing.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.300]   A number of years ago, around about, I would say, 2015 or '16, I was in a position where
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.140]   I looked around and I just thought, "I'm frustrated with stock investing."
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.100]   Number one is I was working on building a business.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.500]   What I realized is that I had far more profit potential from building a new business, a
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.700]   business that was not connected to work for time, a business that had a global opportunity,
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.620]   the business that had a potential revenue potential of unspeakably large, extremely
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620]   profitable.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.620]   I realized the single best investment that I can make is to invest into my business,
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.020]   into radical personal finance.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.940]   I said, "That business can be so much more profitable than anything else.
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.300]   I'm going to go all in on that.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.020]   No matter what it takes, I'm going to go all in on that."
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.940]   I moved money to cash, partly for safety because I didn't want to have volatility.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.360]   I figured if I spend every dollar in my savings on building this new business, and if the
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.820]   business succeeds, it would be worth it.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.640]   If I keep all the money as emergency funds and savings, just in case I need it, and that
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.060]   allows me the safety to build a big business, it'll be worth it.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   That was what I did.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.340]   But along the way, I'd become frustrated with some of the ethics of stock market investing.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.340]   I wasn't focused on the specific volatility or scared about the market goes down or it's
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.340]   all lies and fake.
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.860]   I just was frustrated with the ethics of big companies.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:21.220]   The number one thing that has really bothered me over the years is how modern capitalism
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.500]   has become crony capitalism.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.780]   Just no question has become, in my opinion, unquestionably crony capitalism.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:33.780]   I realized that the single most important job description for most companies is their
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.580]   corporate lobbyist.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:36.580]   That bothers me.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.620]   It still bothers me intensely.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:46.720]   I find it utterly offensive that seemingly the single first thing that a company wants
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.260]   to do is get a lobbyist so they can go in and get the laws adjusted.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.240]   There are two aspects to this that I find really offensive.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:02.300]   Number one is that companies constantly lobby for rules that add more regulation to their
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.980]   industry.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.060]   That seems counterintuitive.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.060]   You think I said what I didn't mean to say, but I meant it.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:14.620]   Companies lobby for more regulation for their industry so that they can keep their competitors
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.220]   out.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.860]   That's what is, to me, so frustrating.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.460]   Because as you look at the US economy, you look at a mature economy like the US American
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:30.500]   economy, and you look around and you consider what's actually there, it's very profitable
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.260]   for most large companies to not have small upstart competitors.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:43.340]   This leads to a calcified, locked in, repressed almost economic system.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.340]   It's what you see in the United States, where there's almost nowhere in the broader US economy
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:55.260]   that you look for and you find innovation, except usually in some area of internet work,
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.220]   a digital company of some kind, because there are just fewer regulations.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.500]   But even there, you're starting to see it.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.020]   You see Facebook last year when they're called before Congress saying, "Come out, regulate
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.020]   us."
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.620]   Zuckerberg is sitting there saying, "Regulate us, regulate us, pass laws."
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620]   Why?
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.100]   Well, I don't want to be too ... I don't want to try to say what Zuckerberg thinks, but
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.380]   it wouldn't hurt Facebook to have some pretty intense regulation right now.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.660]   Facebook could deal with any regulation because they're highly profitable.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.740]   They can afford to pay all the people to dot everything out and take care of everything.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.780]   It's Facebook's competitors who would be hurt by increased regulation.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.900]   But you look at the US economy and you say, "There's almost no area of excitement."
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.140]   What are you actually excited about with the broader US economy?
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.880]   There's no area of growth, of adjustment.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.340]   You have tiny areas.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.100]   For example, I pay attention to the electric car marketplace, but it's so unfathomably,
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.440]   impossibly expensive for a new car company to come out that you have just a tiny number
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   of success stories.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.660]   You have Tesla, and then you have Rivian, who gets invested in it.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.940]   Without this big, huge investment, they can't make it.
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.980]   Now, you go back and you compare that to the dynamism of a US economy of a century ago,
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.180]   where you had far less regulation.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.020]   You had dynamic development in all areas of the economy.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:15.500]   I'm convinced that there's nothing that's fundamentally changed about the potential.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.380]   It's just simply that the regulatory environment is so intense that it leads to really very
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.140]   modest ability for companies to change, to adapt.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.260]   Again, the place where you usually see it is in digital markets.
[00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.100]   That really bothers me because big companies, I'm personally convinced.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.040]   I can't prove it, but I'm personally persuaded at the moment.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.500]   Big companies use regulation as a tool to keep from being competed with by small upstart
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   competitors.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.020]   I find that really offensive.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.260]   The other thing that's really offensive is that the companies just directly lobby for
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   changes and changes in laws that are going to help them and help their own business models.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:58.900]   Let me give you an example just from today's Wall Street Journal.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:04.380]   You see right here, when you look at the Wall Street Journal and you think about what's
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:05.780]   actually happening right now.
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.540]   First, you had all these companies that put themselves in a situation where they were
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:20.120]   broke in no time at all, where they couldn't even handle three weeks of no business before
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.020]   all of a sudden they come crying for handouts.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:29.980]   You have trillions of dollars being given to bail out giant Wall Street corporations.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:35.180]   Thankfully, some of that money, some of the money is filtering down to smaller businesses
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.740]   as well who don't usually have the lobbying power that large corporations have, but trillions
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.020]   of dollars going to these companies.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:45.940]   What's the first thing that you see now when you look constantly at the news?
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.940]   You see that number one, one of the basic focuses is that we want more.
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.660]   Wall Street Journal article headline, "Lobbyists Press Congress for Last Chance at Coronavirus
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.660]   Stimulus Funds."
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.540]   This is from May 3, 2020.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.300]   "Democrats Want to Expand Stimulus Aid.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.420]   Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Says New Help Should Be Tied to Liability
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.580]   Protections for Business."
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.700]   Lead, "Lobbyists for business groups, labor unions, and non-profit associations are shifting
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.540]   into high gear as Congress considers what could be a final round of aid to combat the
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.140]   economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic."
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.460]   So first it talks about, the article talks about non-profits, but then it says this,
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.260]   "Other organizations are seeking relief from measures that were aimed at preventing
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.060]   coronavirus aid to companies that have lots of debt.
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.800]   Saks Fifth Avenue thinks government rules that prohibit federal assistance to firms
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.420]   with too much debt don't take into account the vast real estate holdings and other collateral
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.660]   options of many department stores.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.780]   Such a change could help Saks and others qualify for federal help.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:51.460]   Saks has hired a former top Senate aide as a lobbyist and hopes to win the support of
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.260]   Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from New York.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.260]   Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship department store is in Manhattan."
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.920]   So you see, Saks Fifth Avenue putting themselves in a situation where what they feel like they
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.820]   have to do to succeed in this time is to hire a lobbyist to change the laws so that they
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.260]   can get some government money, get some government bailout money.
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.940]   But it's not the only one.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:16.060]   Men's grooming company Harry's Incorporated has hired a lobbyist close to President Trump
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.700]   to try to change another provision that makes it harder for startup companies to qualify
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.860]   for loans backed by the government.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.060]   New companies can take years to be profitable, making them ineligible for government help
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.460]   due to a rule that prevents loans to failing businesses.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.620]   Harry's doesn't qualify for federal assistance under that rule, even though its business
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.540]   appears to be thriving.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.840]   Last year, a rival grooming company tried to buy it for $1.4 billion.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.980]   On April 13, Harry's hired lobbyist Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for Mr. Trump's
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.460]   presidential campaign.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:54.140]   Joshua Kushner, the brother of Mr. Trump's son-in-law and advisor, is a Harry's director
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.860]   and investor.
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.620]   I do appreciate the Wall Street Journal making it obvious that this is a bipartisan issue,
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.540]   because it certainly is.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.900]   You got Mr. Schumer, and you got Mr. Trump.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   Everybody's involved.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:12.540]   And so you've got this constant revolving door where it goes from Wall Street to Pennsylvania
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.860]   Avenue, Wall Street to Congress, back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.660]   And it's disgusting.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.380]   It's utterly, ethically, morally disgusting.
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.260]   Continuing on, who else is going to get involved?
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.700]   More than 100 retailers, commercial real estate firms, and insurers want to create what they're
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:33.060]   calling America's Recovery Fund, which would build on the already historic economic rescue
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.060]   efforts.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.780]   The coalition, which will formally launch on Monday, wants more federal support over
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:42.060]   a longer time to more companies, said Trevor Hanger, the group's research director.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.900]   "Businesses across numerous sectors are not going to make it without additional support,"
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.860]   said Mr. Hanger, whose coalition includes blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.120]   The existing PPP program is aimed at getting businesses to retain or rehire employees.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:58.260]   The coalition contends the needs of consumer-facing businesses and their landlords are more complex
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.760]   and require grants that can be spent over a much longer period of time, with the flexibility
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:09.020]   to spend more on expenses like rent, utilities, taxes, and debt.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.180]   So what do you see?
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:14.140]   You see that it seems like almost the first situation, first thing that the companies
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:19.940]   did in this most recent catastrophe was run crying to Congress and say, "We need money."
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.220]   Didn't even take a few weeks before everyone says, "We need money."
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.940]   Now, is there an ethical argument saying, "Well, the government shut us down and therefore
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.060]   we should get some government money"?
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.780]   I grant that there's an argument there.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.580]   I don't buy it, but I grant that that's a legitimate argument.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.260]   But what's amazing is that this is the first response, seemingly, of everybody.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   "I need some money."
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.460]   Now, you want to know why.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.940]   One of the things that I do, most of what I have to say about the stock market is not
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.940]   from an investment perspective.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:49.500]   It's not saying, "Well, in the long term, the investment perspective is going to be
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:53.980]   bad," although I'm going to make a little bit of that argument later.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.980]   But this is one of the many reasons why the investment opportunities are so bad, because
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:05.780]   you have this calcified structure where you have these huge corporations that are so accustomed
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.500]   to and reliant on government money, and you never have a clearing of the decks.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.380]   Back in 2008, what should have happened?
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.100]   All these companies should have gone bankrupt, and then newer competitors should have come
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.900]   in and bought out their assets, but they didn't do it.
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.140]   They didn't let them go bankrupt.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.200]   They didn't let them fail.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.380]   And so what do you see in 2020?
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.700]   You see the same thing happening.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.700]   We're not going to let them go bankrupt.
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.060]   We're not going to let them fail.
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.300]   And what's needed is to clear the decks.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.940]   What's needed is bankruptcy for all of these companies that can't make it.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.620]   All of their assets will be sold off at auction to somebody else who will come in and start
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.960]   again, and that would be the thing that would actually lead to economic growth.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:48.380]   But instead, we've got this calcified corporate crony, corrupt—I'm lacking more C words,
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:54.780]   but we've got this system that just leads to tremendous inefficiencies and is leading
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:00.260]   to a stale, stagnant economy, in my opinion.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:05.740]   Time will tell whether that prediction turns out to be true or not.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.240]   I don't like that business model.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:13.060]   I don't like to be involved in it, and I find it really, really revolting.
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:22.640]   When you have a society that says, "We're going to steal money from citizens for taxes.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.940]   Then we're going to use that tax money to put in place laws that are lobbied for."
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:33.020]   And the laws are in many cases written by large corporations who can hire successful
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.500]   lobbying firms to get their position through.
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:44.180]   We're going to reward this utter corruption of this back-and-forth flow of going to Congress
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.060]   and then going to Wall Street, going to Congress, going to Wall Street, back and forth and back
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060]   and forth.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.780]   And we're going to pay for access to the legislators.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.580]   And then when things go bad, we're not even going to let anybody pay for the price of
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.580]   their actions.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.220]   We're going to just step in and bail them out and print more money.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.220]   It's absurd.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.100]   Anyway, that for me has always been the biggest issue.
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.540]   I believe in the value of a free market system.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.780]   I want to compete in an area of open competition.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.140]   I've never asked for a bailout.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.220]   I've never asked for something.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.740]   I believe that there's something fundamentally valuable about an individual taking the risk.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.700]   That's why I love the Internet, because I can speak on the power of my ideas.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.500]   I can be in a situation where I'm not sitting here saying I'm going to coerce somebody to
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   do it.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.580]   I can just bring my ideas and I can compete.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.860]   And there's a totally free market.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.740]   I compete for your ears, for your eyeballs.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.100]   I compete with everybody in the world.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.420]   And you can say anything you want in the comments.
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.420]   You can share.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.420]   You can not share.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.640]   And I love that because it's almost the purest expression of competition where it's the value
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.700]   of my ideas and the value of my advice that has to stand on its own.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.140]   How do I, who believes in those values, how do I then turn around and say, "We're going
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.700]   to reward this antiquated, calcified, corrupt system, and we're going to say that that's
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.180]   the best we can do from an investment perspective?"
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:07.340]   Especially when the investment returns stink and the volatility is off the charts and the
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.860]   regulation is unheard of.
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:20.500]   It's frustrating.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.500]   Other issues that I have.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.740]   When I look at the broader market, just the S&P 500, I personally, again, not going to
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.980]   try to tell you what to think, but I personally do not like a lot of the businesses that these
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.260]   companies are in.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:40.660]   I find them really, really frustrating, the businesses that these companies are in.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.140]   I don't like how many of these companies are involved in war.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.980]   The United States government and the country of the United States of America has been at
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.500]   war for almost 95% of its history.
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.340]   You look at that and you say, "Why?
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.420]   Why on earth does this exist?
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.820]   How could it possibly be the case that you have a country that's at war for almost, for
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.660]   like 93 or 95% of its history?"
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.140]   There's been basically been about a dozen, 12 to 15 years in the history of the US government
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.940]   that they've not been at war.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:18.660]   Now I'm not in Howard Zinn camp.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.260]   I'm not going to accuse everything of craziness.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.460]   I'm firmly in a Smedley Butler camp myself.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:30.500]   If you're unfamiliar with him, Smedley Butler was the man who wrote most decorated general
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:40.660]   in history in the United States.
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.660]   He was a Marine Corps general and had two medals of honor.
[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.540]   He wrote this incredible book years ago after World War II.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:49.380]   He wrote this incredible book that was specifically called War is a Racket.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:59.500]   In that book, he goes through and he shows in that book, specifically, he shows why war
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   is a racket and why there's this horrifying commitment to war based upon the finances
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   of it.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.660]   He goes through in that book and he explains how it's all about money.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.900]   He does such a great job with it.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:25.580]   Him, again, most decorated, I think soldier, but certainly Marine in history.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.060]   He goes through and he just shows how crazy the whole thing is.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.580]   He shows how even the big wars that most people would agree, like these wars are morally valuable,
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.500]   wars like World War I, World War II.
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.180]   You would say these wars were necessary or they were valuable.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.820]   Well, maybe they were, maybe they weren't.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.820]   None of us were that.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   We don't get to choose and it really doesn't matter.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.820]   We can look at them in history.
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:52.940]   What we can be sure of is that they were unquestionably profitable and that they made massive amounts
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.540]   of money for the inside people.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.460]   You look forward and you say, "Why does the war continue?
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.260]   Why on earth does it continue?
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.740]   Just on and on and on.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.740]   It never ends."
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.060]   Well, it never ends because it's highly profitable.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.340]   You go through the large companies in the United States of America, you look at Northrop
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.060]   Grumman and Raytheon and Boeing and whatnot.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:18.300]   You just realize how much of it is based upon war and this promulgation of constant and
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.540]   never ending war.
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:24.740]   It makes you sick to your stomach, especially when you realize who pays the price.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:30.220]   Who pays the price is the people who get killed by it, the millions and millions and millions
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.180]   and millions of people who are killed by it.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:37.020]   Yet here I am profiting as an investor from this.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.780]   It just bothered me for years.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.500]   That would be an example of the kinds of things that you can consider.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   You have to make your own decision.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.740]   You have to think about it.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:53.100]   I think that it's so hard because when you come to any of these issues, we all have family,
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:33:00.940]   we all have friends who are involved in these things, and it becomes personally troubling.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.300]   For me, it's a big, big deal.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   I hate the violence.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.980]   I hate the war.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:12.140]   It really bothers me because how can I earn money on this system that promotes just extensive
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   war?
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:17.180]   One of the big concerns I have right now is I feel like everything smells like and feels
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.980]   like we're headed for even more of it.
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.980]   What would everybody say?
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.220]   What would happen to the stock market if war took off?
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.060]   Well, there'd be some people who would say, "Well, the stock market is going to be bad,"
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.260]   but most people agree that war is good for an economy.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.500]   It unites a nation and results in let's go and do it.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.980]   There's only a tiny number of us who would buy the overall arguments that things are
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.100]   destructive, but what I will say is that although I think war is destructive to an economy,
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.620]   war is very profitable to stock investors.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.580]   There you have that never-ending disconnect between the economy and the stock market.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:54.260]   It also really bothers me just that the ongoing social activism of some of these huge companies
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.860]   because it seems like I'm always on the wrong side of the social activism.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:04.220]   For example, I'm deeply offended by war for the reasons previously stated.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:10.380]   I think it's really, really bad, but I believe that there's real value in individuals having
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.060]   firearms, for example.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.500]   There's a massive difference between tools of war, tanks and battleships and F-22 fighter
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.700]   jets versus rifles, AR-15s or otherwise.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.420]   The difference is the scale and who benefits from them.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.260]   You have a system where the government will spend tens of millions of dollars on an F-22
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.220]   or on an aircraft carrier and yet wants to say simultaneously, "We're going to ban AR-15s."
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:40.100]   The Canadian government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, "We're not going to have AR-15s in
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.100]   this country."
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.980]   Well, Justin Trudeau is still going to be protected by AR-15s or the Canadian equivalent,
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.060]   military equivalent, and his troops are still going to have it.
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.940]   It's just that individuals are not.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.820]   You have companies ... It's frustrating.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.820]   The banks, right?
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.820]   In 2018, Bank of America said, after the Parkland shooting, Bank of America says, "We're going
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.420]   to stop producing loans and financing loans for companies that are involved in firearms
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   manufacturing."
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.460]   Well, on the one hand, I personally support their right of discrimination.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.680]   I believe that you and I have an absolute unconditional right to run our businesses
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:17.100]   and our lives as we see fit when we're in a voluntary society.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.620]   So I support their right to discriminate.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:24.560]   It just feels like their right to discriminate is everywhere and nobody seems like will give
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.400]   much of ... It doesn't seem like they afford the same right to other people.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   What else?
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.620]   Again, back to the banks.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:37.580]   Banks and payment providers are actively excluding people from commerce, people that I care about.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.060]   Right now, there have been many Christian ministry organizations who have been canceled
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.700]   by PayPal, who have been canceled by Stripe, who have been canceled by their merchant providers
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:52.340]   because they get blacklisted by a social activism organization that disagrees with their position.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:56.300]   Now, do I personally support the right of discrimination by PayPal and Stripe?
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.340]   Yes, I do.
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.500]   But it's frustrating to say that now my investments are going to be from these people who are
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.580]   discriminated against, people who believe things that I think are really important.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.260]   Sometimes really, really difficult.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.260]   Or what else?
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:14.860]   What about just the involvement of a lot of the organizations and invasions of people's
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.860]   privacy?
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.700]   Again, we're getting into pretty esoteric territory.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.020]   I'm just giving you some things that are the kinds of things that bother me.
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.260]   I wouldn't just pull out of the stock market based on this.
[00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:27.140]   But you look at what the banks and the finance companies do in response to the Patriot Act
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.780]   laws and just the complete destruction of privacy.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   It's frustrating.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.140]   Now, in the United States, is that life and death?
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.700]   No, it's not.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.460]   But around the world, is it life and death?
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.380]   It absolutely is.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:46.700]   I find it really frustrating when some of these big companies submit to human rights
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.980]   violators to make a quick buck.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   You look at a company like Google, right?
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:59.500]   In 2018, Google comes out and I think it was Project Dragonfly is revealed, where Google
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:05.700]   gone back and forth with the Chinese censors over the years about whether or not they were
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.820]   going to censor web search and censor different things.
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:14.620]   Google had generally taken a pretty strong anti-censorship track.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.860]   They stood up for what Google professed to believe, right?
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:22.060]   Do no evil and organize and allow access to information.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.020]   Well, in 2018, the information comes out about Project Dragonfly.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:30.140]   Now, Google is going to facilitate and work with the Chinese government to put themselves
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.860]   in a situation where they're going to have a censored version of Google web results.
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.420]   Now, is that Google's right?
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.220]   Sure, it's Google's right.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.500]   But the Chinese government is unspeakably evil.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   They are evil.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:49.140]   They have murdered tens of millions of people and today, today are persecuting and executing
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:55.180]   and imprisoning millions of people in the most immoral and unjust fashion.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.820]   People that I care about, right?
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.100]   Millions of Christians in China suffer because of the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.260]   Right now, millions of Muslims, the Uyghur Muslims are being completely devastated, locked
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.340]   up, sent to re-education camps.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:12.460]   The Chinese government, let alone even coming out with the coronavirus, COVID-19 and the
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.020]   insanity of that.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:20.020]   You have one of these just incredibly evil governments and you have Google saying, "Oh,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.020]   okay.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.340]   Well, we'll talk a lot, but when it comes down to actually making a buck and us being
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:31.140]   excluded from the government, from a huge market, we're going to just roll over on that
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   stuff."
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.140]   Fine.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.140]   Right?
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   Is that Google's right?
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140]   It's certainly Google's right.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:38.500]   My issue is why should I try to profit from that?
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.980]   How can I sleep at night when Google is sitting here saying, "We're going to submit to these
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.780]   evil men just so we can make some extra money."
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.740]   And I'm supposed to sleep well at night when my brothers and sisters, my Christian brothers
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:58.240]   and sisters are locked in prison right now, when they're being disappeared off the street
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.860]   right now, and now I'm going to go to bed at night and say, "Well, at least my 401k
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.860]   is up."
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   Like that's unconscionable.
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.860]   It's unconscionable.
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.020]   And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:15.380]   For me, now again, I know I'm unusually sensitive to these issues.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.140]   I know most people, it doesn't seem to bother them, but it just goes on and on.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:25.260]   It feels like increasingly, Joshua Sheets in 2020, it feels like almost every move that
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:31.020]   is popular on the broad level is something that's against something that I care about.
[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:41.300]   I care deeply about children and the ability for children to grow and to not be, to have
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.340]   just the ability to grow and to succeed.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:47.180]   And yet we live in a world where everything is about marketing to my children's eyeballs
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.940]   as early as possible.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.860]   And I fight day and night to keep their eyeballs free of all that stuff.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.780]   And yet now I'm supposed to say, "Well, I know that this is the fundamental operating
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:03.140]   philosophy of this company, and I'm working to keep my children insulated from the destruction
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:08.820]   of staring at this screen and being totally marketed to and bombarded left, right, and
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:09.820]   center.
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.900]   But now I'm going to profit from it for other people's children."
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:18.300]   How does that fulfill any kind of ethical standard of...
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.060]   It's just, it feels so dirty.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.700]   And so that's a lot of things.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.460]   It just seems like for me, with the moral positions that I hold and the ethical things
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.180]   that I think are pretty clear, whether I'm right or wrong, of course I believe I'm right,
[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:40.500]   otherwise I wouldn't believe what I believe, but it seems like at every turn, the majority,
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.840]   I don't know if all, but the majority of large publicly traded corporations have official
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.020]   positions that are directly offensive to me.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.540]   And yet I'm supposed to line up and say, "Here, here's the money."
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:41:02.180]   At the end of the day, I just came to a point, I thought, "How do I get to the end of my
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:11.580]   life and stand before the Lord and say, 'Here's my accounting of what I did with your money,
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:12.580]   God.
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.260]   Here's how I invested it.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.660]   And here's all the money that I made on it.'"
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.340]   And God says, "Well, what return did you get?"
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.580]   You read the parable of the steward, right?
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:30.780]   The master goes away and Jesus tells the parable and he says, the master goes away on a long
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:36.100]   trip and he comes back and he gives one talent to, depending on which version we use, he
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.820]   gives a talent, gives a few talents, 10 talents, gives 20 talents, comes back from the trip
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.900]   and says, "Give me an accounting."
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.180]   And the master's expecting a return.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:51.180]   And I see that parable that Jesus taught as directly applicable to my life.
[00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.860]   When God entrusts money to me and he says, "Here, here's money.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.980]   You are the steward of this money."
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.640]   He expects a return.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.620]   So I imagine myself standing before the master, right?
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.420]   The master comes back from a long trip and I'm standing there saying, "Well, what's the
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.420]   return?"
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.260]   "Well, God, I made 8.2%."
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:10.940]   Meanwhile, millions of people were murdered around the world, right?
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.380]   Other people were locked up.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.540]   We destroyed society.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:16.140]   We destroyed lives, right?
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:23.100]   Millions of teens committed suicide and yet we're going to stand by and profit from it.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:29.100]   Over time, it just grew and grew and grew to the point where I'm like, "I can't do this."
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:32.660]   Now could I have ever come to that position as when I was a financial advisor?
[00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.940]   I don't know if I could have.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.260]   I'd like to say I could have, but it would have just meant the complete destruction of
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.700]   my entire business, right?
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.780]   How do you operate in that environment?
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.780]   You can't.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   So it was almost like I needed a few years to detox from it.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.940]   But over the years, for those reasons, I've had all of my investment accounts just sitting
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.940]   in cash.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:53.300]   Now does that mean that I'm fundamentally opposed to investing in stocks?
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.300]   No.
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.020]   There's lots of ways I think to work through handling that.
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.780]   There's lots of companies that I admire.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.020]   There's lots of companies that I'd be proud to own, publicly traded companies that I personally
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:04.120]   would be very proud to own.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:09.220]   But what I came to, as I said, the mass market approach, just buying the mutual fund that
[00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.060]   includes everything, I didn't feel good about it.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.580]   I acknowledge the efficiency of that kind of scenario, but I didn't feel good about
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.700]   it.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:28.820]   I came to the realization that I was as blinded to investment opportunities as most of my
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:37.940]   clients because I was trained by this mainstream system that exclusively relied on financial
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.580]   advisors to market their products.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:46.540]   What I started to realize over time is that there was a massive world of potential investments,
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.100]   a massive world of opportunity that I just wasn't tuned into.
[00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:56.900]   And so once I walked away from the stock market, I started to realize that there were many
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:04.100]   other areas of investing, many ways I could build huge wealth, invest very effectively,
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:09.900]   and not have some of the ethical concerns that didn't help me to sleep well at night.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.460]   I'm also convinced that a lot of those things are far more profitable.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:18.540]   Now I'm not at a position yet as a mature investor where I can confidently teach you
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.660]   what they are.
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.620]   I can teach you some of the academics of one area or another, but I'm not willing to
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:27.260]   say, "Look, here's my investment record," because I haven't done it for long enough.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.380]   I don't have the results to speak for themselves, and I try to speak to things that I actually
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.380]   know about.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.860]   So we can talk about it academically, but I can't say, "Look, you should invest like
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.860]   me."
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.620]   What I can say is that as I have dug in deeper and deeper, I've realized that there's this
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:48.180]   whole world of investment that I never before thought about because I was so focused on
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.980]   stocks, stocks, stocks, stocks.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.100]   And when you start opening up your mind to those things, all of a sudden you now turn
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.460]   around and you look back at the stock market and you think, "This is crazy.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.940]   You're trying to tell me that this is where I should invest my money?
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:09.740]   You're trying to say that this is the best thing that I can do with my money right now?"
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.060]   When you look at it and you think about—I'm sorry for the phone call.
[00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.060]   I'm still learning.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.980]   I'm live streaming the recording of today's show, and usually nobody calls me, but unfortunately
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:20.980]   I can't.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:28.640]   I'm using all my phones as cameras, and so I'm being interrupted by a phone call here.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:33.940]   When you look at the stock market and you're open to other opportunities and other ideas,
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:38.540]   it's hard to make a really strong argument for the stock market with the exception of
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.100]   a few basic arguments.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.340]   Let me make the positive thing about what the stock market, speaking generally, is really
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.340]   good at.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.060]   As I see it, it's basically two things in the modern era.
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:56.740]   Number one, investing in the stock market makes investing really, really easy for people
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:57.860]   to do.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.700]   It makes it really, really easy in the modern world for people to do.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.900]   It's so easy for people to open an account.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.380]   You can do it in an app on your phone.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:11.700]   You can go to any one of these investment markets, and you can just open an account
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:17.260]   and boom, you can be invested in five minutes in some pretty good investments, speaking
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.860]   purely from a financial perspective, broadly diversified, low cost.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:22.260]   It's pretty incredible.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:28.140]   When you go into markets where that level of efficiency does not exist, and you go back
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:34.100]   to a place like the United States where you have that level of access to the market, it's
[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   sobering.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:40.540]   It's really sobering because you realize what a stunning achievement it is in market efficiency
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:45.580]   and building out this powerful world of investments where any individual with a smartphone app
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.260]   can just open it up and boom, invest into it.
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:54.260]   In the stock market, because of that, it's very efficient.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.260]   Costs are low.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.540]   You look at the incredible revolution that's happened over the last couple of decades,
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:05.780]   even in just the decline of costs, the decline of costs of investing, the major impact of
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.140]   passive investing, of firms that have cut fees.
[00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.020]   There's almost no comparison.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:16.540]   When you look at the market, you see how incredibly efficient it is with the tremendous focus,
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:22.620]   the tremendous constant and never-ending focus by the investment analysts.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.380]   It's really incredible.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:29.020]   The US stock market has succeeded in making investing easy.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.260]   That I think is well worth acknowledging.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:38.740]   It's worth and important to acknowledge that investing is easier in the United States than
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.840]   almost anywhere else in the world.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:49.940]   The other thing that's worth acknowledging is that when you invest in the stock market
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:55.140]   and you invest in mass market mutual funds, you can make a little bit of return, a decent
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:02.220]   level of return, and you can do it with zero input.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.320]   That's amazing.
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   I don't know of any other investment that truly comes close to being passive.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.620]   People talk about passive income.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:12.020]   They talk about, "Well, I'm going to make passive income because I'm going to start
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.460]   a YouTube channel and get advertising revenue," or, "I'm going to make passive income because
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.220]   I'm going to buy rental houses," or, "I'm going to make passive income because I started
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:25.920]   a network marketing company and I received overrides on the purchases of my downline."
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.380]   None of those things are passive income.
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.000]   None of them are passive income.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:42.820]   They're income that necessarily is not directly tied to the work of today, but none of them
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.780]   are actually passive income.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:54.420]   The only thing that I think actually qualifies as passive income specifically is dividends,
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:49:00.260]   living on the dividends from publicly traded companies and/or living on the dividends and
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.700]   profits from a large mutual fund portfolio.
[00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.780]   Maybe you say, "I'm going to put all my money with American funds, and I'm going
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.020]   to spend my dividends from the American funds in mutual funds," or, "I'm going to put
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.020]   all my money with Vanguard.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.580]   I'm going to buy the Vanguard total stock market index fund.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.980]   I'm going to live on 3% of my portfolio."
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:23.540]   That's genuinely, truly passive, but almost nothing else is.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.340]   You can get a little return from that, broadly speaking.
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:32.540]   You can get a little return for that, and you can do it totally passively.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:36.940]   I think that there's also ways to do that, that you can generate those results and still
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.580]   satisfy maybe any ethical concerns you have.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.100]   Maybe your concern is, "I don't want to fund the war," but you can put yourself in a situation
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:50.900]   where you say, "I may not want to fund the war, but I'm happy to spend Coca-Cola dividends.
[00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:54.620]   I'll spend my Coca-Cola dividends.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.900]   They're not financing the war, but I've got dividends from all over the world."
[00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.220]   Totally passive, really, really powerful as a solution.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:06.700]   But outside of those two things, stock market investing has a whole bunch of downsides.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:14.340]   The first thing is, although the stock market is generally higher in terms of the overall
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:18.420]   return that you can get than something like putting money in a bank, which is its own
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.540]   ethical issue, right?
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:26.380]   The war on savers, which I'm convinced contributes over time to, is going to contribute to more
[00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.480]   and more of a destruction of our lives and our finances.
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:36.620]   When you have a society that penalizes savers through inflationary policies and yet doesn't
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:42.220]   open up and forces everyone into stocks, it just makes it really more difficult.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.620]   I can't go down that tangent.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:52.660]   But in the stock market, you can generate some returns, but you have no competitive
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.020]   advantage.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.740]   Because the market is efficient, you pretty much know that, "Okay, the market's efficient,
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.620]   and you and I have no competitive advantage."
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:06.900]   There's nothing that you and I can do as individuals to go in and get involved in a particular
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.420]   market and really make it pay off.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.020]   We're stuck in a scenario where we're little fish.
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.740]   Now, can you find some little trading opportunity?
[00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.740]   Maybe.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.300]   Is there something that you can do where you say, "I've developed a scheme," or, "I've
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.060]   developed a philosophy," or, "I'm going to buy these companies," or maybe.
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:27.140]   At the end of the day, there's not really any competitive advantage that you and I have.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:30.860]   Why should we invest in a market where we have no competitive advantage?
[00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.100]   You have a much bigger competitive advantage in a market that you know, in a market that
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.580]   you can be involved in.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:40.460]   You have a much bigger competitive advantage working as a plumber and building a plumbing
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:44.100]   company because you can go out and say, "Here's what's going to make us really effective at
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:47.180]   plumbing and here's how we're going to compete with everyone," or, "Here's how we're going
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.460]   to take and build out a chain of automotive repair shops and make that really profitable."
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:56.540]   When it comes to the stock market, you have no competitive advantage.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:57.660]   You're a small fish.
[00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:58.660]   I'm a small fish.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:01.420]   Utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
[00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:05.300]   Why should we go and invest in these areas where we don't have a competitive advantage
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:09.620]   if that costs us investing in another place where you do?
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:15.540]   What I'm convinced, personally, is it costs many investors the willingness to go and invest
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.100]   in a market that they actually do know.
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:22.940]   Because they're so used to investing into their IRA or their Roth IRA, people often
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.180]   don't ever amass any meaningful wealth and thus they don't look at the world through
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.780]   the eyes of an entrepreneur and see the opportunities.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.980]   They look at the world through the eyes of a broke salaryman who has a bunch of money
[00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.620]   and a 401(k) and they don't see how they could get involved in this other business opportunity
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.500]   over here because after all, my money is locked in the 401(k) and yeah, I know I could do
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.380]   a self-directed 401(k) but that's really hard and my company doesn't allow it.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:53.860]   They go through life as basically a salaryman without ever applying that entrepreneurial
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.100]   mentality to the world and seeing the investment opportunities.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100]   They'll see a house.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.580]   Somebody will see a house across the street for sale.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.060]   Honestly, for many people, it never enters into their brain, never, that they should
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.060]   buy it.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.060]   Never.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.860]   They don't ever think of it because, "Oh, that's not an investment," or "I don't like
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   real estate."
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.680]   They don't look to the guy next door to them that's a real estate investor himself and
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.780]   realize I could lend that guy money at 15%.
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:27.300]   I make a whole lot more with very modest risk versus the stock market and have it secured
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.500]   by real property instead of something made up.
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:34.220]   I have no inset edge in the stock market.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   I'm a small fish.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:40.220]   I have no competitive advantage and I'm dealing with strangers whose character I cannot assess.
[00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:41.860]   That's the thing.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:48.020]   When you see a company come out, when you see an Enron, the classic Enron and WorldCom,
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.060]   what keeps those things from being an everyday story?
[00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.940]   Part of it is due to the very efficient marketplace that people are involved in.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:04.060]   Part of it is due to the constant scrutiny of the analysts and the news media chasing
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:05.060]   down hot stories.
[00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:10.540]   But at the end of the day, you still have no ability to know the people.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.060]   Whereas if you invest closer to home, you can know the people and you can take a bet
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:19.620]   on a person because you know their character.
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.620]   The volatility in the stock market is crazy.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.740]   It's crazy and it makes no sense to me.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.940]   It makes sense to me that there is volatility, but the direction of it makes no sense to
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.780]   me.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:41.340]   If there's anyone who should know what's going on with the stock market, it should
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.340]   be me.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.220]   I'm not claiming to be the world's greatest analyst.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.220]   I'm not.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   I'm not claiming to be a charter.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.220]   I'm not a CFA.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.900]   I've never been that interested in it.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:55.860]   But you would think that somebody with a master's degree in financial planning, who was a certified
[00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.660]   financial planner, I'm in the process of reinstating, but it's not reinstated yet, so I can't say
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.740]   that I am.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.260]   You would think that somebody like me should know what's going on in the stock market,
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:11.160]   considering I used to make my money telling people to invest in the stock market.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.460]   I don't understand it.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.420]   I genuinely do not.
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:15.420]   I do not understand it.
[00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.580]   Now, part of it is, okay, I get that the market, and I would teach.
[00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.980]   If you were calling my Q&A show and you were saying, "Josh, explain the market," I would
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.460]   say, "Well, the market doesn't really exist.
[00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:29.540]   The market is this word that we use to describe the individual decisions of millions and millions
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:34.020]   of people, millions and millions of businesses, funds, all of whom are buying and selling
[00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.300]   for their own individual reason.
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.640]   It could be somebody's buying or selling because they think the market's going to go down.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.180]   Could be someone's buying and selling because they need money to pay for their kid's college
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.180]   tuition.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.380]   Could be someone's buying and selling because their dad died, left them stocks, and now
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.380]   they're selling.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.420]   We have no idea why, so we just talk about the market."
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.740]   But realistically, when you think about the overall themes, it's just hard for me to make
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.820]   sense of.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.460]   It's really hard for me to make sense of.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:02.820]   So we say this thing, "Don't invest in something that you don't understand."
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.500]   We say this little aphorism, "Don't invest in something you don't understand."
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.180]   We say aphorisms, and I like aphorisms.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.020]   I'm the king of aphorisms.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:13.500]   We say, "You shouldn't invest in something that you can't explain to your five-year-old."
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:18.780]   And yet when I honestly, genuinely come down to it, and I honestly, genuinely think, "Do
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.500]   I understand the stock market?"
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.220]   The answer is no.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:28.060]   The answer is honestly, genuinely no.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:29.300]   I don't understand it.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:33.180]   I know something about it, but I don't understand it.
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:40.340]   And so why am I investing massive levels of money in something that I don't understand?
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.580]   Now I'm basically making some bets, right?
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.220]   I can make the arguments, and I'm not saying sell your stocks.
[00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:52.220]   I can make some of the arguments for the long term and say, "Here's where things can grow
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.580]   over time."
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:55.980]   I look and I see significant headwinds.
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.900]   Let me give you an example.
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.420]   Over the last few years, you've seen most stock analysts, most people involved in stock
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:10.260]   analysis have minimized and have put themselves in a situation where they downgraded some
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.860]   of their predictions.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:12.900]   They said, "You know what?
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:18.420]   We think that there's some major headwinds coming up over the long term, and because
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:19.420]   of that, we're going to downgrade.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.260]   We think the winds are going to be more difficult."
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.260]   Vanguard, right?
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.260]   Everyone's darling.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.540]   Vanguard comes out and says, "We know that there are headwinds."
[00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:29.060]   Jack Bogle, before he died, "Things are going to be more difficult."
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.060]   Why?
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.980]   Well, I look at something and I see a lot of reasons why.
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.140]   An example would be this.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:40.340]   I think one major headwind against US growth and also global growth is going to be the
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:47.020]   plummeting or destruction of population growth, the population decline.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:52.100]   There's been such a destruction to birth rates that you have this entire economy that was
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:56.700]   predicated upon basically constant and never-ending growth fueled by large birth rates, and you
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.780]   see the birth rates are going, "Boof," right off a cliff.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:05.580]   Now, most of the wealthy nations of the world, including the United States of America, are
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:10.220]   below replacement birth rates, which means you can expect to see population shrinking.
[00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:13.460]   Is this any kind of overnight thing where all of a sudden it's going to happen right
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.460]   now?
[00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.060]   It's going to happen and boom, things are going to fall apart?
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.500]   No, it's not.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.500]   But what you do see is this is going to have a long-term impact.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.740]   Now, here's the question.
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:32.420]   How do declining birth rates impact the stock market?
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:38.620]   I don't know, because the stock market is this giant amorphous thing made up of thousands
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.660]   and thousands of companies.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.780]   How do declining birth rates impact Toys R Us?
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.380]   Well, they result in the total destruction of Toys R Us.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:51.220]   I can understand that because people aren't having children, children aren't buying toys,
[00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:54.800]   the toys that they are buying are often more electronic, more digital, and so physical
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.620]   toys is a market that's completely fallen apart and led to the bankruptcy of companies.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:05.000]   So I can understand a company, or maybe I run a company locally, maybe I have a local
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.060]   toy store, now I can understand what the impact is.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:12.180]   Or I can look and say I run an education company, now I can understand what the impact is.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:16.940]   So I can chart a trend out and I can think how it impacts my company that I know, but
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:21.660]   I can't bring that over and apply it to the stock market.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.460]   I don't understand the stock market.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:26.460]   I can only understand companies in the stock market.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:32.060]   So it goes on and on and on when you think about the lack of understanding.
[00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:36.300]   But I guess one day I woke up and I said, you know what, now that my paycheck doesn't
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:41.940]   depend upon my pretending that I understand the stock market, I honestly have to acknowledge
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.060]   that I don't understand it.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.500]   I can make some arguments for it.
[00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:50.020]   I can make some arguments as to why it's good.
[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:54.540]   In the last weeks, I have encouraged family members to keep their mutual funds.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:59.320]   I'm not saying sell out of mutual funds, but for me as an investor, why should that be
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.220]   a primary part of my life?
[01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:11.780]   Final train of reasoning where you realize the stock market is just woefully not nearly
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:15.740]   a superior answer as some other things are.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:25.180]   About the only thing I get from investing in the stock market is financial return.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.460]   But investing in so many other areas gives me additional returns.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.860]   For example, pretend I live in New York City.
[01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:37.060]   Well, I can invest into mutual funds in my IRA.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:49.740]   I can also lend money to a friend.
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:54.940]   I can also lend money to a friend just to make sure I don't get the prohibited person's
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.940]   rules wrong.
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:00.780]   But I can also self-direct my IRA and I can lend money to a friend and that friend can
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:07.060]   purchase a rental house in Florida and then simultaneously my friend can lend me money
[01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.660]   from his IRA to purchase a rental house in Florida.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.420]   So I've established a source of financing from my IRA.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:18.020]   We'll choose some rental houses and then once a year I need to go to Florida to check on
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.540]   my rental house and so now my travel expenses to check on my investments are now going to
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:28.780]   be deductible to me and my friend might also choose that week for him to go and check on
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:34.060]   his rental house and we'll go and during the day I'll work on my rental house.
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:39.420]   Notice I'm not saying I'm specifically steering clear of a prohibited transaction because
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.860]   I'm not working on my rental house that my IRA owns.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.740]   I'm working on my rental house that my friend's IRA has a mortgage on that lent me.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.700]   So I'm there working in the daytime on my rental house and then at nighttime we can
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:56.260]   go down to the tiki bar and hang out together and have a nice time together.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:00.500]   I can't do that with mutual funds at least not in a tax efficient way and oh by the way
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.860]   the returns on that rental house depending on what I do I can juice those returns by
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.380]   actually applying all the techniques of real estate investing.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:13.260]   I can juice those returns by putting myself in a situation where I just dramatically expand
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.220]   my opportunity for profit.
[01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.660]   I can do that all over the world.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.460]   I can go into markets that are far more interesting, far more profitable than Florida.
[01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.540]   There's plenty of investors in Florida but I can go into markets all around the world
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.300]   and do exactly the same thing.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.900]   Now I can get a little bit of currency play.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.100]   I can get a little bit of political play.
[01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:35.260]   I can do some things in ways that should over time dramatically enhance my returns.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.060]   One of the most fascinating things to me that I've been studying a lot is just banking rates
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.220]   around the world.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.460]   You wind up stuck like in the United States or in the United Kingdom.
[01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:49.100]   You wind up stuck in these banking situations where you get no return on your money because
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:55.940]   you're living in a calcified economy with low interest rates because the Fed is desperately
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.780]   trying to boost some growth in the economy.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:04.180]   Meanwhile you can't get any return just on your savings.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.220]   But if you go around the world there are all kinds of markets around the world where they'll
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.960]   actually pay you a return on your savings in the bank.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.860]   So how do I wind this down?
[01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:16.360]   I hope this wasn't a screed.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.260]   My goal was not to sit down and record a screed of everything wrong with it.
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:27.140]   The stock market is good at giving you easy ways to invest money and it's good at giving
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:34.980]   you something of a return maybe over the long term with zero input from you.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:41.340]   So if you are a high income professional and you say my day job is fine.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.140]   I don't want to go and be a plumber.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.620]   I don't want to go and invest in timberland in Nicaragua.
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.500]   I don't want to go and do this stuff.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.580]   I just want to work my day job, earn my money, put money in my 401k and relax.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.460]   Well the stock market is going to be the best solution for that.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.340]   But there's a percentage of us, I don't know what that percentage is, but there's a percentage
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:11.860]   of us who are just involved in that automatic system by default.
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:17.220]   Not because we chose it, but just that's the default option.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:22.220]   And so what I would tell you is that from one guy who went into that automatic default
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:30.740]   system, I went into it as a default system as a Roth IRA investor when I was a teenager
[01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:31.740]   going through college.
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.780]   I went into that default system as a mainstream financial advisor.
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:42.780]   And as one guy who's come out of it fairly slowly and set out and kind of charted for
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:49.860]   myself the radical personal finance approach, when I see the wealth of options that are
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:58.540]   available beyond that, I have no incentive to go back.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.500]   And when you see the costs that come with it, right, the crazy volatility for reasons
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:09.740]   that you can't be sure of, the impenetrability of the markets, you sit back and you watch
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.100]   people's portfolios just decline.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:18.500]   I know, right now, I know how well my investments are doing because I understand them.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   And this is the first market crash that I didn't have money in the stock market.
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.660]   And as I've tried to make very clear, it wasn't because I timed it.
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.780]   Respect to those who want to do that, that was not my thing.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:34.620]   But I understand my investments now.
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.620]   And even if I don't get as good of a result, which I think is probably unlikely in time,
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:40.340]   at least I understand them.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:47.740]   And I feel good about investments contributing to society instead of being destructive to
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.940]   society.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.340]   In the future, I want to invest in a lot more private businesses.
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.900]   I haven't figured out how to do it effectively yet.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.740]   It's a project of mine.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.740]   But I want to invest in businesses that actually help their neighbors and serve their neighbors
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:04.520]   instead of enslave their neighbors and put their neighbors into debt.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:11.580]   I want to invest in businesses that lead to peace and prosperity, not to war and destruction.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:18.440]   And I want to invest in businesses that are on a good moral standard instead of corrupting
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.580]   society and corrupting youth.
[01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.620]   And I sound like such an old man.
[01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   Apologies.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.620]   But I guess I'm becoming an old man.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:34.420]   Just that at the end of my life, I don't want my investments to be an area that doesn't
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.660]   count.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.580]   I want my investments to be an area that I'm proud of.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:42.780]   I don't want to sit back at the end of my life and say, "Yeah, yeah, Lord, I made some
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.780]   money.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780]   Isn't that great?"
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:49.700]   I want to sit back and at the end of my life be proud of what I built.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.060]   I want to be proud of that.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.980]   I always think of a guy like, I don't know, Munger and Buffett, right?
[01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.380]   You think of that.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:03.800]   Buffett and Munger are proud of what they've built because they built a giant business
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:11.980]   that has a legacy and a lasting legacy and they built this culture around it.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.980]   Many entrepreneurs get to the end of their life, they're proud of what they built.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.180]   They're proud of their store.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.180]   They're proud of their business.
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.180]   They're proud of their impact.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:22.220]   At the end of my life, I want to be proud of what I've built.
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:30.280]   I want something that's going to be handed down throughout the generations of my family.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:40.540]   I want there to be a sense of identity, a sense of, "This is us."
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:45.500]   I don't see any way to get that with some shares of an index fund.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.140]   I see a way to get that with a vineyard in Argentina.
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:57.460]   I see a way to get that with an office building in Miami.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.860]   I see a way to get that with a farm in Mexico.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:06.380]   I don't see a way to get there with ... I see a way to get there with radical personal
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:07.380]   finance, right?
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.220]   Maybe we spin off a bunch of businesses in the coming decades.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.220]   I don't know.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.820]   I don't know what the future holds.
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:16.980]   But I see a way to get there with a sense of pride.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:20.980]   Having a sense of pride in my investments, I've realized, is something that I really
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.740]   care about and that I really want more of in my life.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:30.200]   It's much more satisfying than the disgust that I used to feel when I opened the pages
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200]   of the Wall Street Journal.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.540]   I guess I should say these.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:40.140]   I'd open the screen of the Wall Street Journal and read about the latest shenanigans on Wall
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:43.140]   Street.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.980]   That's all I got to say, but that's my answer on why I don't miss investing in the stock
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:49.980]   market.
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.540]   I don't know what's right for you.
[01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.940]   What I would encourage you, though, is think about it.
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   Think about it.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:02.340]   More and more, I've become convinced that if you think about your decisions very carefully,
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:07.900]   at the end of the day, you can often be prouder of those decisions.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:11.100]   And whether you make the same choice or not, at least it was an examined decision.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.420]   There's the old quote, because Socrates, "An unexamined life is not worth living."
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:20.780]   Well, I think there's a real sense of truth in that, that an examined life is really nice.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:25.020]   And so when you examine the basics of your life, you examine where you live, you examine
[01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:29.600]   how you earn an income, and you examine how you invest your money, when you wind up doing
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.300]   it over again, you'll probably feel happier about it.
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:38.540]   What I found for me is that although I think I'll buy more stocks in the future, I think
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:44.980]   I will, I don't think I'll ever go back to that default approach.
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.180]   I don't want those feelings again.
