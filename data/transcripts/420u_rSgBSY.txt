[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.000]   - This week, Pastor John, your new book launches.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   It's titled Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.680]   It's short, it's to the point, it's 150 pages,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.760]   a really good book.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.940]   My copy is highlighted all over the place
[00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.580]   and we will be talking about it this week.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.740]   It's published by our good friends
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.580]   at the Good Book Company in England.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.700]   It's available on Amazon now.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.200]   And of course, the full digital book
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.520]   can be downloaded at desiringgod.org.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.440]   Pastor John, early in the book,
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.680]   you admit that in the process of writing this little book,
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.980]   you say that you experienced a fundamental change
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.280]   in your thinking.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.060]   What happened and how do you think differently
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.980]   about these categories of money, sex, and power
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100]   now after writing the book?
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700]   - There was an encounter and it happened to be
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.200]   with you and the editorial team.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.640]   I don't know if you remember it,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.280]   but it was one of those aha moments for me
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.240]   or as I look back on it,
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.920]   it really was a duh moment.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.080]   Like what's wrong with my head
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.800]   that I have to be made to see by other people
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.760]   what I should see on my own.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.000]   We were talking about the book
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   and about my plan for it over lunch one day.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320]   And I think it was David Mathis who brought something up
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.320]   that was just so obvious that I had sidelined.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.480]   But let me put it in the context of the flow
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   of thought how the book was coming into being.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.000]   I started the book as I was first conceiving it
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.120]   with definitions.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   And an image came to my mind as I was peeling away
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.360]   the layers and going deeper and deeper
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.780]   with the meaning of money, sex, and power.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.480]   And the image was of an iceberg.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.200]   And you can see what a 10th of an iceberg above the water,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.680]   but it's the nine tenths below
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.840]   do all the damage to your boat.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.160]   And what I found over the years
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.240]   is that the effort to define things at the beginning
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   almost always reveals that what we thought
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.800]   we were dealing with is like the tip of an iceberg.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.720]   We thought we were dealing with that
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   and really there's way more to it.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.980]   We thought we were dealing with money, for example,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.960]   paper currency, coins, there it is in my hand.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.760]   But in fact, underneath we're dealing with pleasures
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.240]   and advantages that money can buy
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   or status that money can signify.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.880]   And then we realized, no, that's not the bottom
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.120]   because underneath that is covetousness and greed
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.000]   and fear and cravings for safety and prestige and control.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.080]   And then we realized, no, that's not the bottom
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.420]   either because the Bible teaches us
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.560]   that there's another reality
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.160]   called the condition of my heart,
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.720]   deeper than covetousness that gives rise
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.040]   to all those things like a bad tree
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.240]   giving bad fruit on its limbs.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.400]   And so as always, it seems to me,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.880]   I realized just by trying to define
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.900]   what we were talking about, what I was thinking about,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.120]   this money, sex and power appeared to be
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.440]   like the fraction of an iceberg above the water
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.080]   and the dangerous part was underneath
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.680]   was jagged sawtooth ridges that can slice a gash
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.040]   in your Titanic and there it goes
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.200]   to the bottom of the ocean.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   And that's where I had come when we had our editorial lunch.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.880]   And there we're sitting and talking
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.600]   and David Mathis just mentions almost in passing
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   that money, sex and power are good gifts of God
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.440]   that may be used with great love and effectiveness
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.720]   in serving other people and glorifying God.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.240]   And it hits me like a thunderbolt
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   that my iceberg image is true
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.720]   but it's only true on the negative side
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.200]   and it was holding me hostage as it were.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   It was keeping me from seeing that other side of,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.960]   no, no, these things are not just dangers.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.720]   Money, sex and power are not just dangers.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.500]   They are potentials, they are gifts,
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.200]   they are opportunities to make God look great
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.240]   in the world and advance his cause in the world.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240]   So I went home thinking, oh my goodness,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.440]   I gotta restructure everything here
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.760]   and make sure this gets done in a more biblical way
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.720]   because I was lopsided in the way I was thinking.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.280]   So it's not just an iceberg, I need another image
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   like floating islands of glorious food
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.820]   and fuel and the rarest fruit.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.300]   So in other words, what I realized is that
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.140]   we have to deal with another foundational reality,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.700]   namely these are God's gifts.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   And if they sink us, it isn't because God gave us bad gifts,
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.700]   it's because something happened inside of us
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   that turned gifts of grace into instruments of sin.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.560]   And this totally altered the way I went at the book.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.120]   So yes, we need definitions and I do start,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.080]   chapter one is definitions.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.880]   What are the depths of these three realities
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.120]   we call money, sex and power?
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.100]   And yes, we do need chapters on
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.920]   the pleasure-destroying dangers of sex
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.280]   and the wealth-destroying dangers of money
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.700]   and the self-destroying dangers of power.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.820]   And you can see in those very titles
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.380]   how I tried to catch the positive
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.740]   even when I was dealing with the negative.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.260]   But when we turn away from those dangers to the potentials,
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.020]   we ask, why did God give us these gifts in the first place?
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.660]   Not just to test us, not just to tempt us
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.660]   to be fornicators or covetousness or power mongers,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.900]   money, sex and power all have a unique potential
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.320]   to magnify the worth and beauty of Christ.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.880]   So that's the new structure of the book.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.920]   Define, defeat, deploy.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.800]   So define, go deep with what are these things after all
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.080]   and defeat the dangers and deploy the potentials
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.280]   when God takes his place as our true treasure
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.720]   and pleasure and sovereign.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.320]   - Yeah, so there's really,
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.640]   I mean, when we talk about takeaways in principle,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.440]   there's three, kill the sinful habits of life
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   that misuse God's gifts.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   Number two, praise the giver for the good gifts itself.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.760]   And then three, you take it one step further and say what?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.920]   - I go further and say, actually take hold of power,
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   take hold of money and make them a means
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.320]   of advancing the cause of the giver.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   And more than that, see in the actual gift of sex
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.240]   and money and power, see in them dimensions of God's goodness
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.800]   that when you enjoy them rightly, you are enjoying him.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.120]   - That's brilliant, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.960]   The new book is titled "Living in the Light,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.040]   Money, Sex and Power."
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.520]   It releases this week.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.080]   And tomorrow we're gonna press into the topic
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.440]   of the power of pleasures,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.200]   godly pleasures versus sinful pleasures.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.780]   Can delight in God really compete with the pleasures
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.800]   and allure of pornography, for example?
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.960]   And how should we think of those competing pleasures?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.080]   That's tomorrow.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.120]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.640]   with author and long time pastor, John Piper.
