[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Let us pray. Almighty God our Heavenly Father we come to thee once more and we
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.440]   come O Lord to thank thee for thy great mercy and goodness toward us. Above all
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.840]   we thank thee for him in whose name we venture to approach thee, realizing that
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.600]   apart from him we can do nothing and least of all when we desire to seek thy
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.240]   face. So we come O Lord and rejoice that we are accepted in the beloved. We pray
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.560]   thee to enable us to realize this more and more so that furthermore we shall
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.680]   desire ever to live to his glory and to his praise and especially as when we
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   have the privilege of standing before others to make known the riches of thy
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.320]   grace in him. So we once more ask that thou wouldest look down upon us in pity
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.840]   and mercy and compassion. Help us O Lord to concentrate upon these things. We do
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   realize our utter final dependency upon thee and the power of thy might through
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.800]   thy spirit but enable us to lay hold on everything else that can minister to
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.160]   this end. So we commit and commend ourselves to thee once more praying that
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.280]   thou wouldest be pleased to look upon us and to bless us. Pardon and forgive us
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.880]   our every sin and especially our sins and our failures in connection with
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800]   these most holy things. We plead nothing but the name and the merit of thy dear
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.280]   son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.720]   Well now we've reached the stage at which we've considered the preparation
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.200]   of the sermon and we've considered certain things that are common both to
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.520]   the preparation of the sermon and the preparation of ourselves and the actual
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:07.800]   act of preaching. Now all this so far has been preparation. In other words our
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.000]   ideas concerning these things. So the one question that seems to me to be left
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.920]   therefore is this. Some of you may consider it a trivial one but I want to
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.560]   try to show that it has its importance. Should you announce beforehand the
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   subject on which you're going to preach? You'll have to face this problem because
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.820]   churches seem to like this and especially those who advertise their
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.880]   services in newspapers and so on. It has become the custom to announce the
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.360]   subject. Well now I take the view here that this is something that one should
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.040]   not do. That it's a wrong practice. I say that for many reasons but the first and
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.440]   the overriding reason is that people should come to the house of God to
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.200]   worship God and to listen to an exposition of the Word and of his truth
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.400]   whatever it may be. Whatever aspect, whatever portion, it doesn't matter. That
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   should be the thing that they should be concerned about. Not some particular
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.960]   subject or question. I think this is wrong because I think it's bad for the
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:31.520]   people. I feel that it encourages a pseudo-intellectualism. I call it that
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.600]   because I'm sure that that is the ultimate reason for it. This was a
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.520]   practice that came in last century as far as one can gather. It wasn't done
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.160]   before that and people would come together in the way that I'm saying to
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.320]   worship God and to listen to the exposition of the scripture. But then
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.120]   this notion became current about the middle of the last century that we were
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.560]   now educated and we were now intellectuals and we must have subjects.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.280]   It was a part of that whole turning which took place in the middle of the
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.440]   last century which in Britain we call Victorianism and there was as much
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.040]   Victorianism in this country as there was in Britain. This, as I've already
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.240]   referred to it in connection with the buildings and so on, I do commend to you
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.960]   this study of the subtle change that took place somewhere round about the
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   middle of the last century. A change from the old idea of meeting together to
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   worship God and to listen to the exposition of scripture and the waiting
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.040]   of the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the preacher and upon the whole service.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.240]   The change from that into a more man-centered type of service. We've seen
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.400]   how this works out in evangelism and so on. It's the Arminian outlook and
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.120]   Finney, Moody and all the rest. Well, but I think this was a part of it. This
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.240]   interest in subjects, you see, that we are no longer simple people but we want more
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.160]   or less an address or a lecture rather than to come under the power of the
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.760]   preaching of the word. So I think it's bad because it encourages this
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.080]   pseudo-intellectualism but it also encourages a too theoretical approach to
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.700]   truth. I've been dealing with this in terms of the preacher that it's bad for
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.560]   him. Well then it's very much worse for the people. And another way in which I
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   can put this is that it has the tendency to isolate subjects from the scriptures
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.400]   and indeed ultimately to regard the scriptures as but a collection or a
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.720]   series of statements about particular subjects. And so one atomizes the
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.080]   scripture and forgets the whole. And surely the whole is more important than
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.320]   the parts. This seems to me to be a bad practice that it pulls out these
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.080]   subjects, tends to isolate them from their context, tends indeed to isolate
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.240]   them even from one another. It's only a danger but I feel it is a
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:34.520]   danger in this way. And so one loses this wholeness of the biblical message and
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.960]   becomes interested in particular subjects and questions. But a still more
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.160]   important reason I would say, and this is a pastoral one but of course you can't
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.080]   divide these things into watertight compartments. Why are people interested
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.520]   in these subjects? Well the answer is that they think they know what they need.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.280]   They put it in terms of what they want but they think they know what they need.
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   They're tremendously interested in certain subjects. This is what they want
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.640]   to hear about. Well you must have already gathered that it is a part of my whole
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.160]   contention that they are not in a position ultimately to know what they
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.880]   need. And it's a part of our work to diagnose them and to discover this.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:28.680]   Because so often their ideas to what they need is quite wrong. Of course this
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.960]   applies to us also but it certainly applies to the congregations. And
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:42.160]   therefore it is a part of our whole approach to this matter not to allow
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.440]   this dictation as I say and not to encourage them along this line but
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.280]   rather to give them the whole truth and to bring them to see that there are
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.640]   aspects that they are not interested in apparently. They should be interested in
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.280]   it all and we must show them that they need this. Or putting, let me put it in
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.080]   this form to you, there is always this danger of becoming lopsided and lacking
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   in balance in the Christian life. Some people you see are tremendously keen as
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.440]   they say on prophecy. They want to know if you're preaching on prophecy. If you
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.360]   are they'll be there. There'll be no question about this. I've discovered this
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   so many times. I remember the late Dr. Campbell Morgan, my predecessor, telling
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.800]   me once jocularly if you want an exceptionally large crowd and I'm such a
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.520]   good appeal to preach on prophecy and you'll get them. There are these people
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.760]   they've got this lust after particular subjects, prophecy, holiness and so on.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   Well now if we therefore announce subjects in this way we tend to increase
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:58.240]   this danger of a lopsided imbalanced Christian life. But let me finish and
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.320]   deal finally with this matter by putting it like this. As a generalization now it's
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:15.440]   often amazed me to notice how churches and preachers hold on to 19th century
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:23.720]   methods when they've long since said farewell to the great emphasis
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.440]   especially of the early part of the 19th century in a theological sense. And I'm
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.280]   most amazed of all that this should happen in evangelical circles. You see
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.760]   this whole business of announcing the subject and indeed of having a choir and
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.760]   of having a children's address all these things came in in the last century. They
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.960]   were not done before. It was a part of this pseudo intellectualism and we are
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.720]   now experiencing a kind of hangover from this. And I'm calling attention to the
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.960]   thing in order to try to stimulate you to break into these bad habits. This
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.160]   false respectability and intellectualism that was so characteristic of the last
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:14.280]   century from the middle onwards. These things have become dominating in church
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.720]   services and I feel that they're detracting from the preaching of the
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.560]   gospel and the centrality of the preaching of the gospel. Let's learn to
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.600]   ask why should I do this? How did this ever start? And so on. And I think you'll
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   find that so many of these things are simply hangovers as I'm putting it of
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.840]   what was introduced very wrongly and for the wrong reasons towards the middle of
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.000]   the last century. Well as evangelicals we should be more concerned to do this than
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.840]   anybody else surely. Very well let's leave that at that. But the next thing
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   follows I think from that in a way and this is the whole question of radio,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:03.040]   radio and television preaching. I don't want to spend time on this I dealt with
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   it in the introduction to this series but I've got to just bring it in at at
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:16.080]   this point because you may well be invited to do this kind of thing. Well I
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.560]   personally again am an opponent of this and have refused to do so with one or
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   two exceptions because of very special occasions throughout my life. I did so
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.080]   because I hold the view and still hold it that these ways of communicating
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:45.560]   truth have been inimical to true preaching. In fact I would suggest that
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:52.360]   probably in this century and especially since about 1920 or so on have been one
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:59.120]   of the major factors in militating against a belief in preaching. The
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.760]   argument is of course the results that you get and you'll hear wonderful and
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.720]   thrilling stories of somebody accidentally turning on the radio and
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.280]   suddenly hearing a word which arrested them and they were converted and so on.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.720]   And the same with television. It's always the argument from results but I think
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.720]   we've got to examine this very carefully because there are many sides to this
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:29.200]   question. My rooted objection to doing this is very largely that the service is
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.640]   so controlled. Of course it has to be. These people have to draw up programs.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:42.000]   Only a given amount of time is allotted. From their standpoint this is perfectly
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.600]   all right but I argue that from the standpoint of preaching it is all wrong.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.560]   It militates against the freedom of the spirit. If I've warned you against the
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.680]   danger of allowing the congregation to dictate in this respect well how much
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.560]   more do we need to be warned against allowing radio and television authorities
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.480]   to do this and they will do it because they're interested primarily from the
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.440]   commercial standpoint but quite apart from that even it is surely wrong at any
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.560]   time to start in fetters or in chains with any kind of time limit. I remember
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.280]   once having a discussion on this whole question with the director, the religious
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.360]   director of our British Broadcasting Corporation who had been good enough to
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.000]   ask me to preach more than once and the simple way I put it to him was this. I
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.840]   said what would happen to your programs if the Holy Spirit suddenly descended
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   upon the preacher and possessed him? What would happen to your programs? And of
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.520]   course he couldn't answer. The answer would be of course that you'd be turned
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.480]   off. But what a terrible thing to do. You see we are not in charge and therefore
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:59.760]   it is wrong it seems to me to be hemmed in like this by these time
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   considerations and proprieties and so on. Not only that he made clear they always
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.320]   have to of course that having their eye partly on people who are in hospitals and
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.440]   so on you've got to have a certain number of hymns and prayers and so on
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.360]   and the preaching is crowded out. They don't want much of that and in any case
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.600]   they would be disturbed if you should preach on certain aspects of the truth
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.760]   the question of death and judgment and so on. Now from their standpoint of course
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.920]   one can well understand this but from our standpoint surely this is not
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.400]   legitimate. But with regard to this whole question of results we need to look into
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.360]   this. I would suggest that actually if you really sifted them you'd find that
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.760]   the results are very few in number. They always get great publicity and you're
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.080]   never told very much about what happens to them afterwards. But even granting
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:03.520]   that what we have to bear in mind is the difference between particular results
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:11.720]   and the whole trend of a method. Now this to me is a very important point. I'm
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.520]   prepared to grant for the sake of argument that there are individual
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.440]   conversions and so on. But when you come to evaluate a thing like this I suggest
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.680]   that you should evaluate it in terms of its total effect upon the life of the
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.480]   church. And there I do not think that there's any question at all that the
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   effect has been a bad one. Now I'll give you just one illustration of what I mean.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.120]   I was in this country of yours once a few years back and I was preaching in a
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.960]   church where in the morning there were two services because of the number of
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.400]   people who came. One service at 930 and the other at 11. And one was asked to
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.360]   repeat the service exactly. I was one of those people who couldn't do that. It was
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:06.000]   meant to be verbatim so that the two congregations would have exactly the
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.480]   same thing. However in the evening the service was broadcast and I was most
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.320]   interested to find the first Sunday that having had two congregations in the
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.560]   morning one say of 1400 people and the other of 1200 people my total
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.080]   congregation at night was about 400. And that was customary I was told in that
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   church. But this was the interesting thing that happened. I wasn't familiar
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:39.960]   with this procedure. It came roughly to this that we began the service about
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:45.200]   quarter to eight and the song leader was in charge with them. Green light came on
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.320]   to say that we were on the air. And then there was more singing and so on and so
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.800]   forth. And I was instructed that I when I started preaching the green light would
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.360]   be there but then at a given point a red light would appear. Which was the sign of
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.240]   course that I was to end and everything should really be over by then by the red
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.920]   light I should be pronouncing the benediction. Well on we went and I could
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.720]   see the time going. I began to feel rather anxious. The service was due to
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:19.520]   finish at five minutes before nine. And I found to my dismay that I was on my feet
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.160]   at five and twenty minutes to nine. Leaving me you see just a bare, well not
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.800]   not full twenty minutes because we'd about had to have the last hymn and the
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   benediction before five minutes to nine. Well I was in great trouble. I thought
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.960]   first that it was my duty to cut down what I intended saying to this space of
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   time. And I began trying to do that. But as it happened I suddenly found I was
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.120]   being given exceptional freedom. So when I while I went on speaking there was
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.080]   this great discussion going on within me. Should I be guided by this program or
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   should I be guided by what seemed to me to be the influence of the power of the
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.640]   Spirit upon me. And I decided that I would be quenching the Spirit and guilty
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.600]   of sin if I observed their rules and regulations. So when I saw the red light
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.920]   coming on I took no notice whatsoever. And I went on and finished preaching at
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:20.200]   five and twenty minutes past nine. Well now you wait a minute. They let me tell
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.440]   you the sequel. That was my first Sunday in that church. I then had to go up to
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.840]   some conference and came back again for the following Sunday. There were three
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.040]   assistant ministers in that church and they were very nice men and I'd
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.380]   apologized to them the first Sunday night for what I'd done and hoped they
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.960]   wouldn't get into trouble and told them to land it all on me. Well when I got
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.560]   back the next Sunday morning they were there to greet me and I said I hope you
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.480]   haven't had too bad a week. They said we've had a terrible week. And well I
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.040]   said I hope you explain to them that it was entirely due to me. And I said I hope
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.600]   you apologized on my behalf that I wasn't accustomed to this and I must
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.400]   try to make amends. But they said that wasn't the trouble we had at all. I said
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.840]   well what was your trouble? Well they said we've never had so many
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.400]   complaints about us. Never. I said what was the complaint? They said well the
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.040]   complaints were these. The people were writing in and saying why didn't you
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.800]   give that men more time to preach? We want to know how that sermon went on.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.280]   What did it lead to? Where did it end? Why did you have all that singing? Why that
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.800]   quartet? Why that solo? We can have singing at other times. Why not let, why
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.360]   not give this men more time? And the result was this second time I was given
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.000]   the time. They cut everything down to the bone and I was given about three quads
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.120]   an hour for my sermon. But now this is you see the interesting thing. I told
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.200]   those men afterwards I said you know if I were the minister of this church I
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:55.040]   would not broadcast this evening service but I would advertise this church in
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:02.440]   these terms. The church which doesn't broadcast. Why? Well for this reason. I
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.040]   think then the people would come out for the evening service. You see as long as
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.520]   they can sit at home and listen to it why take the trouble to get out your car
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.760]   and to trouble and struggle with the traffic and all the rest of it. You hear
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.640]   it at home. It's discouraged people from coming to the house of God. It's taught
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.240]   them bad habits. They just want to listen like this to sermons. So that I do
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.920]   really regard this as something very bad because it is doing harm to the whole
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.440]   notion of the corporate life of the church. People have got to think of
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   churches just in places where you sit and listen to a sermon and now you can
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.600]   get it on the radio you can get it on tapes and so on and so the whole notion
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.120]   of coming together and sitting together around the word and listening to an
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:54.560]   exposition of it is seriously damaged and I think that the facts are
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.400]   demonstrating this. That during these years the life of the church per se as
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:09.000]   such has deteriorated very seriously and therefore I again suggest that it's up
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.360]   to us to break into all this. The reasons why men have done it of course have been
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.040]   obvious. They thought it was going to do good to their churches and people
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.160]   hearing them would come and listen and so on. Well I'm suggesting that it really
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.280]   hasn't worked out like that and that you are likely to find in the future that
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.960]   God is going to revive his work in the church and it is those who attend
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.400]   regularly are the ones who are going to participate most of all in the blessing.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.520]   The astonishing thing once more is that people don't want to do this. That
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.160]   they're content with this detached attitude towards these matters. It is a
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.200]   fundamental failure to understand the true doctrine of the Christian Church.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.160]   The unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. The gathering together of the
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.360]   people of God. Now we don't want to make this mechanical or force people to do it.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.400]   What I'm saying is that our preaching ought to fill them with a desire to do
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.200]   this. You don't have to whip them up to do it. Look at those people in Acts 2.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:21.520]   Daily you remember. House to house, daily, continued steadfastly in these things.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:27.000]   This idea that people are content with one service on a Sunday, it's just a
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.880]   failure to understand the true character of the Christian who's like a newborn
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:39.280]   babe thirsting for this milk of the word and the desire to be with his fellows. It
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:47.000]   seems to me to be indicative of a wrong view of the church and of the individual
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   Christian as a newborn babe. Well you see we've allowed these outside forces to
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.320]   influence us over much and I'm suggesting it's time we broke into it
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.960]   all and really tried to get back to the New Testament picture of the church and
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.760]   to conduct our services in that way. Very well let me leave that at that. I now
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.560]   come therefore we've now here is all these are all preliminaries we've made
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:20.960]   our preparations now then I've got next to consider with you the things to avoid
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.680]   in preaching. Things to avoid in preaching. Of course we've been dealing with some of
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.120]   them already but these are I feel extras. First of all the preacher himself. What
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   has he got to avoid? First and foremost professionalism. It is the curse of the
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.960]   ministry professionalism. It's a thing you'll have to fight against as long as
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.000]   you're alive. Professionalism is to me hateful anywhere,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.760]   everywhere. When I was practicing medicine I hated professionalism even
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.040]   there. There's a type of medical practitioner who's more professional
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.680]   than able. He's got all the airs and graces and the things to do and
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:12.720]   the things to say but he's generally a bad doctor. The greater the doctor the
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.360]   less evidence there'll be of this professionalism. Well it's infinitely more
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:23.880]   true in the realm of the ministry. But let me say a little more of what I mean
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.800]   by this. There is nothing more terrible that can happen to a preacher than that
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.480]   his main reason for preaching on a Sunday morning is that he's been
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:41.240]   announced to do so. You see what I mean by that? It's become his job. He's lost
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.680]   contact with the thing that originally moved him and urged him. It's now a
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.360]   routine. It's a job. And if he really asked himself honestly as he walks up
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.400]   the pulpit steps, "Why am I doing this?" he would have to give that as the answer.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.240]   "Why will I have been announced to do so? Therefore I must do so." That's a
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:07.160]   manifestation of professionalism. And then of course it comes out in so many
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:16.280]   ways during the service. A man is too formal. Everything he does is too studied.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:24.480]   This is always a sign of professionalism. I remember a man again in Midsomney
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:30.760]   Family illustrated and we were all amused. Those of us who were not trying
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.480]   to imitate him and to become professional as he was, the way this man
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.320]   used to apply his stethoscope to the patient's chest. It had nothing to do with
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.080]   medicine at all. He wasn't very good at interpreting what he heard, but the airs
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.960]   and graces with which he applied the stethoscope. No doubt it could affect people and
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   help people who were only suffering from some psychosomatic or psychological
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.640]   condition, but if you were really ill it didn't help you. It was more flourish
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:11.880]   than factual and of value. Well, but this happens. You watch men in pulpits and
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   it's pathetic to notice the stances, the studied character of almost everything
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.000]   that is done. There was a famous preacher in London. He actually used to turn
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.560]   around a complete circle as the service went on so that people would have the
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.920]   advantage of seeing the back of his head as well as his face and his wonderfully
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:39.200]   cultivated and ordered hair and so on. Literally, literally this happens and
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.040]   people crowded to see this, but that's sheer professionalism of the worst type.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.480]   In other words, the professional is a man who's always watching himself. He's
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:59.640]   always watching himself and he's always tremendously interested in techniques.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.160]   This sort of man has always gone round listening to others, picking up ideas,
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.720]   watching how men do various things and then they try to imitate them and to put
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:17.360]   them into practice. I believe you have something similar in the realm of
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:23.440]   acting in the theater. There was a time when a man was a born actor and he just
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.440]   went and acted, but I believe they've introduced something which is called the
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:31.680]   method. They all tend to be doing the same thing, you see, the method. It's no
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:40.080]   longer real acting in the old sense. It's applying this method. Then there are
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.520]   many other things that one's got to avoid. One's got to avoid a display of
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.400]   knowledge. One of the besetting sins of preachers, trying to give this impression
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.880]   of wide reading and so on. Well, I've emphasized the place and the value of
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.440]   reading, but if your whole object is to show your reading and to make a display
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:11.400]   of your knowledge, it's obviously bad in every sense. Another thing which I would
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:18.840]   emphasize tremendously is this, the danger of relying on your preparation.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   Terrible thing this, but I'm sure every preacher would agree with me when I say
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.480]   this. See, the danger is that having finished your preparation, whenever that
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.840]   may be, but let's assume that it's on a Saturday evening or somewhere like that
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:38.200]   early, the danger now is to say, "Well, now then I'm ready for tomorrow." Because you've
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.720]   got a good sermon, you've finished your preparation, and you put your reliance on
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.520]   that. There's no greater danger in the ministry and ministry of preaching than
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.840]   just that. You'll be let down by it, you'll be disappointed, and you'll be
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.440]   less effective. It's an awful temptation. You see, that's why I've emphasized the
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.040]   preparation of the man himself and so on, and I shall deal with it once more before
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:11.320]   we're finished, but I just put it in at this point. Watch this, watch it carefully.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.440]   You'll find yourself doing it. It's right, and you're not right. Just say that
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:23.360]   yourself and you'll be able to correct it. And then, of course, the preachers then
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:31.040]   in the pulpit, many men relies on a good voice, many men's proud of his voice, and
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.040]   gives a display of it. Astonishing, but you see you're always fighting the devil,
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.520]   and he's there with you. Then many a man, perhaps who hasn't a good voice, may rely
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.320]   on his eloquence or his oratory and so on. I mustn't weary with these things. Let me
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:51.200]   try and sum it up by saying, what advice would I give at this point?
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.960]   Well, I'm entitled to do so as a great sinner, as one who's fought this battle
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.360]   for so many years. I would say, I would put it like this to you. Watch your
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:09.800]   natural gifts and tendencies and idiosyncrasies. Watch them. What I mean by
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:16.600]   that is this, that they will tend to run away with you. If you like, I'll put it in
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:23.240]   a phrase. Watch your strength, not so much your weaknesses. It's your strength you've
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.560]   got to watch. It's the things at which you excel, the things at which
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.120]   you're good. They are the ones that are most likely to trip you, because they are
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:39.600]   the ones that will tend to lead you to make a display of them, and to pander to
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:49.360]   self and so on. So watch these, and watch your idiosyncrasies. We've all got them,
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:56.480]   but we must watch these. Perhaps I could put it like this to you. The preacher
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:05.720]   always has to guard himself against this terrible temptation to be a character.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   You see, people like a character, and if a man has got these certain elements in
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.040]   him, you know what I mean by character, that he's something a bit out of the
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.480]   ordinary about him, and something which people regard as attractive. His danger
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:26.600]   is to pander to this and to play up to this, and in the end he's just calling
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:34.840]   attention to himself. Men like to be quaint or odd or different, and to get
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.840]   people to talk about them. This is the danger. So I'm putting it
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:47.800]   in that form. Beware of this, and especially watch your strong points.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.080]   They are the ones that will get you down. Let me put this in the form of a picture.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.160]   I remember once hearing a man preach on Absalom, and this was the whole point he
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:03.720]   was making. I don't know that exegetically it's a sound point, but it
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.240]   certainly, you see, impressed itself on me. You remember Absalom was very proud of
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:13.040]   his hair, this wonderful hair that he'd got, and he used to pay great attention
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.780]   to this, and to make his best of it. And you remember that finally it was his
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:23.120]   undoing. He got caught up by his hair in those trees as he was going through, and
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.640]   gave the opportunity to Job to thrust the spear into him. The man's point was
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:34.440]   that this great strength of his, his hair, was his final undoing. All right, you see,
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.080]   I've remembered that, so that sometimes even though a man doesn't always keep to
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:44.000]   the rules, he gets his lesson home. That doesn't justify breaking the rules. So
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.480]   all I'm saying to you is, watch your strength, whatever it may be, your
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:57.320]   hair or anything else. Don't display it. Very well, so I sum it up by putting it
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.120]   like this. The greatest, obviously, of all the temptations to a preacher is pride.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.400]   Pride, because he's set up there, almost on a pedestal. He's standing in a pulpit.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.360]   He's above the people, everybody looking at him. He's got this leading place in
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:19.520]   the church, in the community, and his greatest temptation of all is pride. And
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:26.880]   it takes terrible and horrible forms, and many, many forms. But as long as one
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   realizes this, all is well. I've already said something about how to deal with it
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.280]   let me repeat this because it is so important. The best way of checking any
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.920]   tendency to pride, pride in your preaching or in anything else that you
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:52.160]   may do in that way, is on Sunday nights to read the biography of some great saint.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.840]   Doesn't matter which of them, there are plenty of them. You can get the books and
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.480]   read them. But if you think you've done amazingly well and that nobody's ever
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.720]   preached like that before, well just dip into Whitfield's journals and I'll
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.600]   guarantee you will be cured in less than five minutes. Or take up David Brainerd or
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:15.360]   somebody like that. And if that doesn't bring you to earth, then I say you are
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.080]   just a pure professional and you're beyond hope. But that's the antidote.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:28.480]   Bring yourself down. Well those are some of the special dangers confronting the
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:35.400]   preacher. But now with regard to the sermon, you see I'm putting it here
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.880]   because so far when I was dealing with the preparation of the sermon, I was
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.480]   anxious to do it in general. These are sort of special points, refinements on
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:53.160]   top of what we've been saying. Now as regards the sermon itself, beware of too
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:02.320]   much intellect. I put that first. I put that first particularly to you people. I
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.760]   wouldn't have to put it first to everybody. But to some, this has got to
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:15.720]   come first. I remember a bit of advice given me many years ago. I was preaching
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.560]   on one occasion with another preacher that used to be the custom in Wales at
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.360]   that time and special occasions to have two preachers and they both preached
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.800]   together in a service. The younger men first and the older men afterwards. But
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.400]   that began to be varied and I found myself preaching alone in the afternoon
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.720]   and then the old men had preached alone in the morning and we both preached
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:44.160]   together at night. Well he heard me preaching in the afternoon alone and it
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.760]   was the first time he'd heard me. So as we were being driven in the car together
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:54.000]   to have some tea, you don't have tea but we have tea between the afternoon and
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.920]   evening meetings, he said to me, he was an old man, he was at that point
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:08.560]   exactly 60 years older than I was, he said, he was quite kind to me, he
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.320]   wanted to encourage me but he gave me a very serious warning. He said the great
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:20.160]   defect in that sermon this afternoon was this, he said, that you were overtaxing
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:25.800]   your people. You were giving them too much and then he went on to put it like
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.000]   this. He said I'll give you a rule, remember it as long as you live, only one
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.960]   in twelve of your congregation is really intelligent. Only one in twelve, that was
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:45.480]   his assessment. Remember that he said. They can't take it, it's impossible for
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.080]   them to take it, you're only stunning them and therefore you're not helping
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:55.320]   them. And then he said to me, he said, you watch now what I do tonight. He said I
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.800]   shall be saying one thing rarely but I'll say it in three different ways and
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.880]   that was precisely what he did. He was a very intellectual man, very able man. There
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:09.640]   may well be some of his commentaries in the library here but that's what he told
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:16.040]   me. So I'm putting it in this form to you. Beware of too much intellect. You see
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.840]   it's inevitable isn't it that you should fall to this danger because you spent so
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.520]   many years in studying and in reading and in discussing with others and you
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.440]   tend to assume that everybody's like that but you're not, you're strange birds
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.080]   and remember that these people are very different. They haven't had time, they're
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.880]   business people, all sorts of things. Beware then of too much intellect. Of
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   course I equally emphasize beware of too little but that's not the thing that
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.040]   needs to be emphasized here. I'm preaching you see to my congregation as
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.800]   I've told you always to do. Not to somebody else who isn't here but there
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.400]   are people to whom it is necessary to say beware of too much sentiment and
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:03.760]   immersion. The first men hasn't sufficient of this, too intellectual but
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.820]   then there are some people who are nothing but emotional and sentimental.
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:11.440]   I've heard men give a text and then they start telling stories and on and on and
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.760]   on they go and they become more and more sentimental. That's bad. And then there
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.780]   are those who need to be warned against mere exhortation. So often men think that
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:28.400]   preaching just means an extended exhortation. They start exalting the
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.280]   people. It's all application. They don't present the truth and make the
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:37.640]   application inevitable. The whole time they're getting at their people and
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.240]   slashing them and exalting them and calling them to do this and that and
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   forcing them. Too much exhortation. There are some men who don't exalt at all.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.840]   They've given this brilliant intellectual disquisition and is left
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.520]   at that. There's nothing to move anybody to tears or to action. No emotion, no
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   feeling, no exaltation. Well now, all this obviously is wrong. So I put it in that
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.120]   form of beware of too much of any of these. Well then I come to another. The
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:17.080]   place of polemics in a sermon and in preaching. Now the polemic element is of
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:24.960]   course important and it has its very definite place. It is good for the people.
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:32.360]   But I'm warning now against the danger of too much polemic. And I think that
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.280]   this will be the danger of most of you again. You've been struggling with
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.280]   rival theories and heresies and things of this description and your mind is
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.200]   naturally full of this. But I say be careful that you don't have too much of
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.680]   this. Why? Well the people, the bulk of the people to start with are probably not
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:59.920]   interested. A large number of them don't even understand. Remember that, that there
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.440]   are such people. Now I'm saying there is a place for it. I'm saying that there
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.440]   must be too much. And of course you have always got a certain number in the
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   congregation who are too interested in polemics. And it's very bad for them of
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.040]   all people. They are the people who will travel miles in order to hear a
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.640]   slashing attack on a man or on a theory or any or the rest of it. And as you know
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:26.400]   men who are always polemical generally get a good hearing and they generally
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:33.480]   get good collections also. But this is a real snare. Now I'm so concerned about
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:38.420]   this because I've seen good men ruined in this way and I've seen good ministry
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:45.160]   ruined. I've seen great preachers ruined I think by this. Shall I tell you about a
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   discussion I once had with one of them but I'm not going to mention his name.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:57.040]   But he was one of the greatest of these polemical preachers. And I had the
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.880]   privilege of spending a day with him many years ago. And we got onto this
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:08.840]   theme. We got onto it through his asking me a question. He said do you read Joseph
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:17.320]   Parker? This was a great preacher in London until about 1901. And he published
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:22.560]   great volumes of sermons, the People's Bible. He said do you read Joseph Parker?
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:27.520]   I said no I read very little of Joseph Parker. He was amazed at this. He said oh
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.840]   I read Joseph Parker every Sunday morning. Always he said. Always read
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.080]   Joseph Parker before I go to church on Sunday morning. He puts me right you know
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.840]   he said. Old Parker he said was wonderful. He said I can't tell you how I enjoy
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.920]   reading old Parker making mincemeat of these of those modernists of his age and
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:52.960]   liberals which gave me my opportunity. I said well you know I said I must confess
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.200]   that doesn't appeal to me. What exactly did Joseph Parker achieve after he'd made
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.920]   mincemeat of these people? Well that set us off and we had this great discussion.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   And I only remember now it went on for the whole day. But I only remember three
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.360]   points in the discussion which I'm repeating to you because I trust there'll
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:23.840]   be some help to you. He at one point said to me now but look here he said I was
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.720]   suggesting to him I was trying to appeal to him that he was ruining his great
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.880]   ministry by having these tirades every Sunday night in particular either on
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:42.080]   some teaching it was very often Roman Catholicism or even on persons. They were
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:46.040]   brilliantly done but I was trying to suggest to me it was ruining his
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:51.640]   ministry. But he said you're unscriptural. He said let me remind you he said that
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:57.600]   the Apostle Paul tells us in Galatians 2 that when Peter went astray the Apostle
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.840]   withstood him to the face. He said that's all I'm doing. He said I'm doing what Paul
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:10.720]   did. Surely this is right. To which I replied I said yes I know that Paul tells
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.320]   us that he did that but I said I am interested in the result. I noticed that
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.160]   the result of Paul's dealing with Peter and tackling him face to face at Antioch
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:27.440]   was that he persuaded Peter that he was wrong and won him to his position. And
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:32.880]   Peter later on in life expresses his great admiration of the Apostle Paul and
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.680]   his writings. Can you say the same about the people whom you attack? And of course
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:45.160]   he could only get up and walk away from me for a while. If you can win people to
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.080]   the truth and to see your position by your polemics all right but be very
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.840]   careful that you do so and that you don't end by antagonizing this man still
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:00.120]   more and antagonizing a number of others at the same time. Well then I remember
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:05.040]   later on in the discussion a second argument came up. He said look here. He
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:09.320]   said I'll put this to you as a medical man. He said now here you are. Here's a
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.840]   surgeon and there's a patient. He's got a growth in his system. If that growth is
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:19.560]   allowed to go on growing it'll kill that man. There's only one hope for him. That
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.160]   growth has got to be extirpated. It's got to be removed by a surgical operation. He
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.440]   said the surgeon doesn't want to operate but to save that man's life he's got to
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.720]   do it. He's got to get this cancer out of the man's system and body. He said that's
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.120]   precisely my position. He said I don't want to do this sort of thing but he
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.160]   said I've got to. This cancer has come into the church. It's got to be removed.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.200]   Got to be extirpated. What was the reply to that? Well one had to think quickly
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.360]   but the reply to me was an obvious one. I said you know you've chosen an
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:58.160]   unfortunate illustration. Perhaps I know more about surgeons than you do. I said
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:03.040]   there is such a thing as developing the surgical mentality and it's the thing
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.280]   one's got to be very wary of. I said if you really are ever taken very ill never
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:15.840]   accept the verdict of a surgeon alone. Always check it either by your general
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:21.620]   practitioner or by some physician. Why do I say this? I'll tell you why I said. The
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.400]   surgeon tends to develop the surgical mentality and outlook and
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.840]   unconsciously the moment he looks at a patient he tends to think in terms of
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:36.360]   operation. Take it out. Take it out. Now this is actual fact. This is actual fact
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.360]   and I've always told people never submit to the opinion of a surgeon alone. Always
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:48.520]   check it. So I said would you tell me that you can say honestly that you're
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:55.240]   quite free from this surgical mentality? Haven't you rather got into the way now
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.840]   of immediately wanting to operate as it were and you're doing it constantly? And
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.360]   again you see he was in some kind of a difficulty. But then I remember the third
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:12.480]   argument. He said well listen to this he said. This surely will prove it to you. He
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.880]   said every time I indulge in what you call one of these exceptional tirades of
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.520]   mine and they were tirades. He would attack people by name and say the most
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:29.080]   scurrilous things about them. He said every time I do this which you say is so
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.760]   harmful. He said you know the result? The circulation of my paper he says simply
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:40.860]   rockets up. What do you say to that he said? Well I said what I say to that is
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:47.280]   this. I've noticed always whenever there are two dogs fighting a crowd always
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:55.120]   gathers. And I think it is the answer. There are people who enjoy this. I'm not
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:00.000]   surprised the circulation goes up. You attack things and appeal for money you'll
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.960]   always get people to support you. But it's negative. It's destructive. There's
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:13.160]   no question about it. So I said be careful of too much polemics. You see
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:18.920]   this particular man I'm talking about he ended his life almost in isolation and
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.200]   his church had gone down to about a handful from having been a great church.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:27.080]   I knew another man who imitated the men about whom I've been speaking. And while
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.280]   he was alive and able to do indulge in these polemics he had a great crowd every
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:38.760]   Sunday night. He died and within about three months his church was almost empty.
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.240]   These people used to gather together from everywhere to hear this and they
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.440]   appealed to the flesh and they enjoyed it. But he hadn't been building up a
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.760]   church. You can't build up a church on polemics. You can't build up a church on
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:58.280]   apologetics even. Still less on polemics. You've got to give the people the
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.440]   positive truth. But again to be perfectly fair let me say that you must be aware
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.080]   of too little polemics. There are some people you know like to have the
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.880]   reputation of being nice men and it's said of them they're never negative and
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.800]   they like to say that about themselves. Never negative. Always positive. It's
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:22.520]   humbug. It's sure humbug and hypocrisy. The scripture has the polemical element
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:27.360]   and it must be present in our preaching. We've got to warn our people and we've
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:33.400]   got to guide them. But you mustn't let yourself develop this idea that you are
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.520]   the defender of the truth and you're always doing it and you're always
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.080]   attacking people and points of view. It becomes negative and there's no life in
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.240]   it and it certainly will ruin the life of your church. You won't be building up
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.520]   your people. And under this heading I would say this. Beware also keep your eye
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.800]   carefully on the use of irony. It has its place. It has its place but be careful
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.840]   with it. Most people completely misunderstand it and they don't realize
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:04.520]   you're being ironical and they take you literally and then they're offended by
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.840]   it. So be careful with it. It can be used. Sometimes it has to be used. But be
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:18.260]   careful. It's a dangerous weapon. Ridicule I think we should really always avoid. So
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:22.480]   the balance in this matter is in the sermon isn't it? As Paul puts it to the
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:28.680]   Philippians in chapter 1 we are set for the defense and the propagation of the
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:35.320]   gospel. It isn't defense only. Don't just become a self-appointed guardian of the
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:41.400]   faith or a defender of the faith. Defense and the propagation. Let there be this
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.760]   balance and let there be more propagation than defense. Build up the
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:52.840]   people. Give them a balanced message. Preach the whole counsel of God to them.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:50:00.480]   Now lastly in delivery. Now there are many things here in connection with the
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:07.320]   actual delivery of the sermon. I've known a man who never walked into his pulpit
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:14.980]   on Sunday morning. He always ran into his pulpit. Invariably. He, the man I saw doing
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.480]   it and have seen doing it more than once, he was imitating another man who used to
[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.040]   do it. Ran into the pulpit. The idea was you see how keen they were to preach to him.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:32.440]   Well that of course is again calling attention to self. But there's one thing
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.680]   even worse than running into the pulpit which I think is wrong of course. The
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.720]   other is putting on a smile when you've got there. You've seen it happen haven't
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:48.800]   you? The man that puts on this smile in the pulpit. And then I'm reprobating all
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   this then greeting your congregation. Walking into your pulpit and saying good
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:03.760]   morning folks. How nice it is to see you. And how good of you it is to come. You know
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:11.080]   and thanking them for coming. And then still worse, cracking a joke. Or two. Just
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:17.200]   to put the people at ease. Now people do this kind of thing. I've heard
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.360]   people saying that they would justify that in an evangelistic campaign in a
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   hall and so on. I say it is wrong always everywhere in connection with this work.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:34.920]   But obviously how wrong in a place of worship. Why is this wrong? Well I say the
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:43.360]   whole approach is wrong. It isn't our service. They're not coming there to us.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.120]   We are not people inviting them into our home as it were. It isn't our
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:54.240]   service at all. They and we are there to worship God and to meet with God. And
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.520]   what we must try to do is to show them that this is something absolutely and
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.040]   entirely different from everything they do everywhere else. It's not like a man
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.360]   inviting you into his home. He's not in charge here. He's just a servant himself.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.640]   We are all going together into the presence of the living God. I cannot
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:17.160]   emphasize too much this point that we should go out of our way to show the
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.280]   difference between this. You see the whole other notion is, well no there's
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.480]   nothing strange about this. So you say good morning folks and you put them at
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.440]   ease and a few jokes and all is well. If you want to do that sort of thing in
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:34.080]   your own home do so. But it isn't your home. You yourself are under God.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:39.920]   Emphasize this difference. Shall I show you this point by putting it in a way
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:49.080]   which really makes it quite ridiculous. I knew a deacon once who poor fellow was
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:55.320]   anxious to show always what a nice and pleasant man he was and indeed he was
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:00.840]   but he tended to play on this. This is what I noticed about this man. That when
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.600]   I was handing the bread round at the communion service all the deacons took
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.000]   their portion of bread. When he took his he always muttered beneath his breath
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.400]   thank you. And the same with the wine. Thank you. And I had to point out to him
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.360]   that it was wrong to say thank you. If he was in my home as a guest and I handed
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.240]   him bread and butter I'd expect him to say thank you. But not when he's taking a
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:30.200]   bit of bread at the communion service. You see the whole thing is different. I'm
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.440]   not giving him the bread. I'm not giving him the wine. And he mustn't behave in
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.800]   this way. Politeness and the things that you do in society are even wrong here.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:46.760]   The poor fellow never realized what was taking place. No no. What is needed is a
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:53.040]   sense of God. A sense of the Holy Spirit. Now this does not mean that you put on a
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:54:01.960]   false dignity and become pompous. I'm talking about reverence and godly fear.
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:09.560]   Then let me hasten to say this. Don't put on a personic voice. What a terrible thing
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:14.600]   that is. Men do this. They get into a bad habit. They hear others and they do it.
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:22.240]   An affected, personic, unnatural voice. It offends people. Still worse is to put on a
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:29.920]   false appearance of piety. Sanctimoniousness. What a horrible thing it
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:37.960]   is. You remember how Spurgeon really used to ridicule this. He did it whether he
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:43.040]   was right or wrong in the case of people known as the Plymouth Brethren. He put it
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.880]   like this on one occasion adapting those words of Acts 1 11. Ye men of Plymouth,
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.640]   why stand ye there looking up into the heavens? You know this people who sort of
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:59.400]   look up. Sanctimonious expression. What a terrible thing it is. And he also said
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:05.320]   another very wise thing I think. He said whenever you look at a man who gets as
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.280]   the reputation of looking very saintly and who rather likes to think he does
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.040]   look saintly, you can be quite sure, said Spurgeon, that he's got a bad liver. I
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:22.640]   agree 100%. 100%. You see the New Testament tells us if we are fasting to
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:27.880]   anoint the face with oil. You do everything you can not to give the
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.520]   impression that you're fasting. You don't call attention to this. Then another thing.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:38.840]   Avoid chattiness and the so-called easy style. How horrible all this is in
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:43.240]   connection with these things. Never be histrionic. Don't cultivate or practice
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:48.400]   gestures. Everything that is histrionic should be avoided. What's the rule then?
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:54.800]   Well the rule is be natural. Forget yourself. Be so absorbed in what you're
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.140]   doing and in the realization of the presence of God and in the glory and the
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.240]   greatness of the truth that you're preaching and the occasion that brings
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.520]   you together that you're so taken up by all this that you forget yourself
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:14.800]   completely. That's the right position. That's the only place of safety. That's
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:19.960]   the only way in which you can honor God. Self is the greatest enemy of the
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:25.440]   preacher more than any other men in society and the only way to deal with
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:32.200]   self is to be so taken up and then raptured by the glory of what you're
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:37.720]   doing that you actually forget yourself altogether.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:42.520]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
