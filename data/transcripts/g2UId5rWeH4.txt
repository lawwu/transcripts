[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   We come in our consideration of the great message of this first chapter of Paul's epistle
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.800]   to the Romans, this evening to the 18th verse. The 18th verse in the first chapter of Paul's
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:28.640]   epistle to the Romans. "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:41.520]   and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness." We last Friday evening
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.720]   ended by giving a very general view and analysis of this section of this epistle which starts
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.960]   in this verse and goes on until the end of the 20th verse in the third chapter. It's
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.360]   one complete whole, it's one great argument. We took a general bird's eye view of it,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080]   saying that having done that and bearing that in our minds, we would then come back, God
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.520]   willing, and go through it in detail. And that is what we are now going to do together
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:29.480]   this evening. The apostle has been telling these Romans how he longs to see them, how
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.680]   anxious he is to preach the gospel to them, how anxious indeed he is to preach the gospel
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.760]   to anybody, wherever he can find anybody to listen, for he is not ashamed of it. He really
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.680]   glories in it, and he is ready to preach it in the imperial city before the emperor or
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.040]   anybody else. Why? Well, he has been giving his reasons in general, and glorying especially
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:05.920]   in this fact that therein is the righteousness of God by faith revealed to faith. Even as
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.840]   Habakkuk had put it, "The just by faith shall live." And therefore, he rejoices in this
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   great gospel, which is God's way of saving, God's power to save. That's what the gospel
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.080]   is. It's this power of God in operation, saving him, because God does this great work in and
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:40.280]   through his own word. Very well he has been saying that he is proud of it, he glories
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.000]   in it. Well, why? And here he answers the question. Here is the beginning of the answer
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.640]   to the question. And again he introduces it with one of his words, "for." We have already
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.760]   seen the number of times that he uses this particular word. His mind, you see, always
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.360]   moves in a logical, consecutive manner. He works out his great thought, his great idea,
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.040]   the great truth that has been given to him. For. Why does he boast of this gospel? Why
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.720]   is he so ready to preach it? And there are two main answers to the question. The first
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.120]   is that there is a terrible need of it. And the second is that there is nothing but the
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.920]   gospel that is adequate to meet that need. Now, that is the thing that he begins to expound
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.160]   here in this eighteenth verse. I suggested to you last Friday evening that first of all
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.560]   he puts it as a general statement in this particular verse. He will then later work
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.400]   it out more in detail as regards the Gentiles and as regards the Jews. But here it is a
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.160]   universal statement. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.640]   of men. It does not matter whether it is a Jew who is within the covenant or whether
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.840]   it is a Gentile outside the covenant. If he is ungodly, it applies to him. All ungodliness
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:28.760]   and all unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.640]   Now then, here we are face to face with this great statement. The first comment that we
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:47.640]   surely must make about it is this. This is the thing with which the apostle begins. So
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.560]   far, you see, he has just been telling us about the nature of the gospel, the message
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.940]   of the gospel, the truth contained in the gospel. Now that is just a general statement.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:09.320]   But now he becomes the practical evangelist. He has already been telling us about himself
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.960]   as an evangelist, as one who preaches and who is ready to preach, and now he tells us
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.840]   why he preaches. This is his motive. This is the thing that sends him and makes him
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.760]   travel overseas and continents, working day and night to preach this gospel. This is the
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.080]   reason. This is the motive. Now I think that this may very well strike
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.840]   some of us as being rather strange and curious. I wonder how many of us would have started
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   with this. If you were giving reasons as to why you talk to people about the gospel and
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.880]   why you tell them the gospel, or if you are privileged to preach it, as to why you preach
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.400]   it, I wonder whether you would start with this. But you notice, this is the thing with
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.120]   which this man begins. Why is he ready to preach the gospel in Rome or anywhere else?
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.440]   You notice he doesn't say because he is so anxious that they should be happy, all
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.840]   of them. He doesn't say, you notice, that it's because he knows that many of them
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   are living defeated lives and he's got something to tell them that will give them victory.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.520]   He doesn't say to them, "I want to come and preach the gospel to you in Rome because,
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.960]   you know, I've had a marvelous experience and I want to tell you about it in order that
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.840]   you all may have the same experience because you can, you know, if you want it, it's
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:47.800]   there for you." It isn't that at all. This is the thing that he starts with. There's
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.720]   no mention here of any experience. He isn't talking in terms of their happiness or their
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.040]   particular state of mind or something that might appeal to them or certain possibilities
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:08.800]   to them, but this staggering, amazing thing, the wrath of God. And he puts it first. It's
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   the thing he says at once. Here is the motive for evangelism. Here is the thing that urged
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:28.040]   and drove this man. The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and all
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:37.720]   unrighteousness of men. The apostle is interested in the first place, we notice, in men's relationship
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   to God, in their standing in the sight of God, in their eternal destiny face to face
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:57.520]   with God. In other words, the gospel that was preached by the apostle Paul was never
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:06.760]   man-centered. It was always and invariably God-centered. Now to me this is something
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   which is truly staggering. And how important it is that we should pay attention to this.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.840]   How important, in other words, that our Bible study should be spiritual and not mechanical.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.280]   How easy to come to this and to classify it and say, "Yes, the wrath of God," and then
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   you pass on quickly. No, no, but we can't afford to. What this man does is something
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.440]   that teaches me quite as much as what he says. I'm called to preach the gospel, to be an
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.320]   evangelist. We're all evangelists these days. Very well, why am I to evangelize? How am
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.120]   I to evangelize? My dear friends, it isn't enough that you and I should be clear about
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.720]   the evangel. Our methods of evangelism must correspond to the scripture as much as our
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:02.200]   message. And here is the method. He starts with the wrath of God. Not with the needs
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.400]   of the people as such, not the things that were worrying them, that thing that gets them
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.040]   down, that sin that they can't overcome, and their unhappiness and so on. Not at all, doesn't
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:20.320]   mention it, the wrath of God. Now this is surely of very crucial importance to us all
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:27.160]   at a time like this. And I want, therefore, to turn aside for a moment to show that this
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:35.400]   is how the Bible puts it everywhere from beginning to end. You read your Old Testament, read
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.040]   every prophetic message in it, it's always this. Those prophets were always reminding
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.200]   those children of Israel of their relationship to God. That's the thing they bring them
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.320]   back to. Not anything to them personally as such, first and foremost. That follows. All
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:59.720]   experiences are secondary. We mustn't start with experience, we start with position, status,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   standing in the presence of God. You can feel perfectly happy and yet you can be damned.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.040]   You can have a false joy and a false peace and a false thrill in your life. The history
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:19.200]   of the Church is full of that sort of thing. That isn't the thing to start with. And if
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   you and I have any sort of peace or joy or any experience of deliverance or have been
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.040]   able to give up a sin or anything else apart from this first question of our relationship
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.360]   to God, well, we are denying the teaching of this apostle as we are denying the message
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   of the whole Bible. The prophets always started with this. When you come to the New Testament
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.040]   you find John the Baptist doing exactly the same. The first thing John the Baptist said
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   to people who came to listen to him was this, not "Have you come along to have a given
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.920]   experience?" but this, "Who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" Same
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   thing you see. It's equally plain in the message and the method of our blessed Lord
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.360]   himself. Listen to Peter preaching on the day of Pentecost and what does he do? He expands
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.480]   the Scriptures and they're all Scriptures showing men their relationship to God. And
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.160]   the effect of that sermon was to make them cry out saying, "Men and brethren, what
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:29.440]   shall we do?" They were face to face with God. And as you read of the sermons of the
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   apostle Paul in Acts 13, 14, and 17, and 20 especially, you'll find that it was always
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:46.880]   the same thing. Now, this is so vital for this reason. It is this particular thing that
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:55.520]   we are talking about at the moment that differentiates the Christian message from all the cults.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.120]   Now you know there are so many cults being offered to men in the world tonight, and they
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.960]   all come and they offer them happiness, they offer them deliverance from something that
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.280]   gets them down. That's the way they always come. Of course, they're bound to. They must
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.800]   have something to recommend themselves and they make it so attractive. "You've been miserable,
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.960]   come with us and you'll be perfectly happy. You've been defeated, do this and all will
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:22.920]   be well." It's so easy, it's so simple. That's the characteristic of every cult. The one
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:30.000]   thing that makes it impossible for you ever to put this gospel in line with the cults
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.680]   is that it invariably starts with God and holds men and women face to face with him
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   and their relationship to him. Christian people let us never so represent the gospel that
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:50.800]   it sounds as if it were a cult. Let us never so put it, I say, that men and women may mistake
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:59.560]   it for a cult. Let us be scriptural in our method as well as in our message. This staggers
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   me, I say. Has it staggered you? The first thing this man tells us about his reasons
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.600]   for preaching the gospel, which is such a wonderful way of salvation, is "The wrath
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:20.240]   of God has been revealed." But let us go on, therefore, to note that he's holding us face
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:27.640]   to face with God is not something vague or general or indefinite. He doesn't merely say
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.840]   that he's concerned to hold people face to face with God, he particularly specifies "the
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:46.400]   wrath of God." And this is still more astonishing. But again, it's something that this man always
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:55.760]   does. He started with this always. He always put it in right at the very beginning.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:03.400]   Now I take up this point again. There are large numbers of people today who stumble
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:13.360]   at this whole question and conception of "the wrath of God." I suppose, really, there is
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:19.960]   nothing about the Christian message that is so hated, so objected to, as this particular
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.560]   doctrine of "the wrath of God." And therefore, I conceive it to be my duty as we expound
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.280]   this great passage, not simply to note or to mention "the wrath of God," but to show
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:42.920]   you its integral place, its vital place, in biblical preaching, in New Testament evangelism.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240]   We've got to be in a position to be able to deal with what people say about this wrath
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.920]   of God. What do they say? Well, it seems to me there are three main attitudes with respect
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.880]   to it. There is, of course, first of all, the attitude of the unbeliever, the man who
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.200]   perhaps does not believe in God at all. And if he doesn't believe in God at all, he particularly
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.080]   ridicules this idea of "the wrath of God." But even if he says he does believe in God,
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:16.680]   the unbeliever always says that this idea of "the wrath of God" is unthinkable. He
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   says if there is a God at all, he must be a God of love. He must be someone benign.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:36.360]   He must be someone who is so kind and so good that this idea of wrath is an utter impossibility.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:46.920]   You know this general attitude of these unbelievers with regard to this particular question. I
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:53.160]   think I once quoted you before reading a book by a very able man in a certain noble profession,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:59.360]   and he took up this question of the wrath of God. And he said, of course, it's so easily,
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:06.920]   inexplicably said in terms of psychology. He said it's nothing but a kind of projection
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:17.520]   of the whole idea of the Victorian father. You know, the stern Victorian father who ruled
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.240]   his children with a rod of iron, and who didn't allow them to do this and that, and they quaked
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.000]   and trembled even when they saw him coming or heard his voice. "Oh," he said, "people
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   have just transferred that to God. It's this idea of the bogey, as it were." And he really
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.880]   thought that he dealt with it like that. Well, then others of them put it like this. They
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:45.280]   say, of course, every religion is based on fear. They say psychology has taught us that.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.960]   The study of comparative religions has confirmed it. All religion is based upon fear, doesn't
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.440]   matter what religion. They say if you could only get this idea of fear out of people,
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   you'd do away with religion. So that's the thing to concentrate on. They say all these
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.120]   religions, the primitive person you see, he's afraid of trees, he's afraid of the darkness,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.520]   he's afraid of the sun and the star and the moon. There's a God there and he may suddenly
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.440]   do something to him. They say all religion is based on fear and this idea of the wrath
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:22.160]   of God is just a kind of relic of that. Now that's the typical unbeliever's attitude
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.960]   towards the wrath of God. But come, there are others who object to it quite as much
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   and almost as violently, and they are those who we must describe as liberals in their
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.780]   theology, or if you like, modernists. I don't like these labels, but we've got to use them
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.860]   because they're used. Here are people who call themselves Christian and who are members
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.880]   of the Christian church and active in the Christian church. They object totally to this
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:00.040]   whole idea of the wrath of God. And they do so, they say, for this reason. They say that
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   this is nothing again but a kind of relic or remnant of the tribal God of the Old Testament.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   They say that Jehovah of the Old Testament was a terrible being, bloodthirsty. These
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.500]   are their terms, they're not mine. I'm not caricaturing their position. This is exactly
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.960]   what they say. I could have given you the quotations. That bloodthirsty God, that angry
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:30.160]   God, that's a tribal God, they say. They say that's not the God of our Lord and Savior
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.320]   Jesus Christ. That's not the God, they said, that Jesus spoke of. That's incompatible,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:44.800]   they argue, with Jesus' teaching about love, with the whole idea of the fatherhood of God.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.220]   They say Paul, of course, he was a Pharisee. He was rabbinical in his outlook, and though
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:54.680]   he became a Christian, he didn't shed it all. These things still clung to him, and
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.160]   he feisted these old ideas of his upon this wonderful gospel of Jesus. You know, they've
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:09.360]   tried to put a wedge between Paul and the Lord Jesus Christ. That's their attitude.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.840]   They object to the whole conception, and thus at the expense of the Old Testament, dismissing
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:22.600]   the Old Testament as true revelation, they claim that they believe in the God, the Father
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.880]   of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is nothing but love, and to whom this conception of wrath
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.600]   is not only unthinkable, but it is, as I read in an article a fortnight ago, it is blasphemous
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.480]   to suggest, said the writer, that this quality is at all possible even in the God of the
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.640]   New Testament. That's the second group.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.160]   But there is a third group that are in trouble over this question of the wrath of God, and
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:58.200]   they are evangelicals. "Well, dear me," says someone, "can you be an evangelical
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:04.560]   and not believe in the wrath of God?" Wait a minute, there's a difference here. These
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.680]   do believe in the wrath of God. They accept it because it's in the Scriptures. These
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   believe in it and accept it in theory, but they deny it in practice. And to deny a thing
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.600]   in practice is as bad as to deny it in theory. "Oh yes," they say, "they believe in
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.960]   the wrath of God." But they say, "you've got to be careful, you know, and especially
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:36.840]   these days, you don't put that first, because if you put that first, people won't come
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.240]   and listen to you." They say, "you know, modern young people would be put off by that.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.700]   You must attract them," they say. Now, in the interest of evangelism, in the interest
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.880]   of attracting people, they deliberately do not start, as Paul does, with the wrath of
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.920]   God. They say, "after all, you know, people are different now. This is the twentieth century.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.280]   Perhaps you could do that sort of thing a hundred years ago, but you just can't now.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:08.000]   You must make it attractive to people." So you do what I saw on a big poster outside
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.400]   a chapel that I passed about two or three months ago. "Come and join us next Sunday
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:20.280]   evening. Come to our bright Sunday evening service. Come and have a good time with us."
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:28.600]   Cheery music, bright message, "come and join us."
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.880]   Now you see, my friends, the importance of facing these matters. It isn't enough to
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.920]   say, "ah yes, wrath of God," then go on to the next bit or to the next verse. The
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.720]   question is, do we really accept this teaching? Are we controlled by this teaching? Does this
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:52.600]   govern our evangelism as well as our thinking? Does it govern us in practice as well as in
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:22:02.960]   our fear? I say there are many who are denying this doctrine in practice, and they are offering
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:10.440]   Christ to people as a friend or helper or sympathizer, as one who can understand them,
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.480]   as one who will be with them. All that is absolutely true, but they don't start with
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:21.640]   this. It isn't in the context of the wrath of God. It doesn't start where Paul starts.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   They bypass this. They come to something else. And yet I'm emphasizing this fact, that this
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.100]   great apostle starts with this.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.400]   Now let me drive this matter right home, lest there may be anybody in trouble. You see how
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.120]   easy it is, though we believe the gospel, to begin to think immediately in terms of
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.840]   human wisdom and human strategy. The tragedy is we don't believe in the power of the Holy
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.160]   Ghost as the apostle Paul did. Paul didn't stop to ask, "Ah, will the Romans like this
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.480]   doctrine? I wonder when they see that this is my message, will they stay away?" Paul
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.360]   knew that it all depended upon the power of the Holy Ghost. He wasn't a windman in any
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:09.640]   sense. It was the gospel that's the power. And whatever men may do or say, it is our
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:14.960]   business to preach the truth. And the Holy Spirit does the application.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:20.600]   Well now let me prove it to you. Had you ever realized, I wonder, that the apostle uses
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:29.160]   this idea, this term, about the wrath of God, ten times in this one epistle? I'm going to
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.720]   tell you about it. We mustn't make any mistake about this. We are starting, remember, and
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.720]   if we are wrong at the beginning in the first move, we'll be wrong everywhere else. If we
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.560]   are not right here, how can we be right afterwards? Ten times over the apostle brings in this
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:49.480]   idea in this one epistle. Here's the first. The second is in the second chapter in the
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:58.760]   fifth verse. "But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:07.720]   the wrath, the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." There it
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.120]   is for you the second time. And then there it is again in the eighth verse in the second
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:20.120]   chapter. "But unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:30.040]   and wrath." How he repeats it, how he realizes that you can't take it for granted. It isn't
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.360]   enough just to say it and pass on. No, no, go on repeating it, says Paul. There it is
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.280]   the third time. And then we come to the next one in the third chapter and in the fifth
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:46.880]   verse. Now let's be careful about this. I'll read to you first how the authorized version
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:54.480]   translates Romans 3.5. "But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:03.680]   we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?" Now that's an unfortunate translation, that
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.280]   word vengeance. The revised version here, which you've got in the pews, is very much
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:19.480]   better. It puts it like this, "Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath?" "If our unrighteousness
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:26.160]   commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:34.960]   wrath?" Or listen to the revised standard version at this point. It's good at this point.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   "Is God, or that God is unjust to inflict wrath on us?" "If our unrighteousness commend
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:52.240]   the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict wrath on us?"
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.840]   The word that Paul used is the same word as in the previous instances. It's this word
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   that should be translated wrath. Then the next example is in chapter 4 and in verse
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:15.040]   15. "Because the law worketh wrath, for where no law is, there is no transgression." Then
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.600]   the next illustration is in chapter 5 and verse 9, where he's been saying in verse
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.640]   8, "God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.400]   for us." Then verse 9, "Much more than being now justified by his blood, we shall
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:41.080]   be saved from wrath through him." Same idea. Then you go on for the next instance to chapter
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:51.360]   9 and verse 22. "What if God," he argues, "willing to show his wrath, and to make his
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:00.800]   power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction?"
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.760]   What could be plainer? Romans 9, 22. Then our next illustration of it is in chapter
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:14.640]   12 and again in verse 19. Here again, let's watch the translation. I'll read first of
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   all the authorized. "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:34.040]   wrath, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.'" Now,
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:40.560]   the word comes there twice. Let me read to you the revised version, margin, which is
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:50.120]   particularly good at this point. "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:56.840]   give place unto the wrath of God." Now, the authorized, you see, doesn't bring that
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.880]   out. It says, "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath."
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.160]   But what he says is, "Give place unto the wrath of God." Or again, as the revised
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:15.280]   standard puts it, "Leave it to the wrath of God." Don't you do anything about that
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.440]   enemy. Don't you punish him. Don't you get your own back. "Leave it to the wrath of
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:26.880]   God." That's what Paul wrote. "Leave it to wrath." Not give place to wrath. You
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:33.880]   give your place to what is his place. He is the one who is to administer this. "For
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:42.760]   vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord." Very well, there it is then in chapter
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:50.920]   12, verse 19. And then the last two illustrations are found in chapter 13. First of all, in
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:58.000]   verse 4, where we are dealing, you see, with the magistrate. "He is the minister of
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:05.680]   God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   the sword in vain, for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath." The
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   wrath of God, of whom he is a minister. "The wrath of God upon him that doeth evil."
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:29.480]   Then the last example is in the fifth verse, Romans 13, 5. "Wherefore ye must needs be
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:39.240]   subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience." You must be subject to the powers
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.080]   that be, to the magistrate and people like that, not only because of this wrath of God
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:49.920]   that is ever there, but also for the sake of conscience.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.800]   Well now there, you see, we find that this great apostle, in this one epistle, ten times
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.880]   over, repeats this and repeats it and repeats it. That is why he starts with it. It is a
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.600]   controlling conception. The apostle simply cannot think of the gospel except in terms
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.360]   of this tremendous idea of the wrath of God upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.720]   men. But it is not confined to the epistle to the Romans. Go through the whole of Paul's
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:25.080]   epistles and you will find that he has got it everywhere. Listen to him in 1 Corinthians
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.240]   3. He is talking about various ways of preaching and of building up the church. He says, "Every
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:38.120]   man's work will be judged. Some build wood, hay, stubble, and so on, others precious metals.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.240]   What about it? The day is going to declare it. Every man's work will be tried by fire."
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:51.760]   The day, this day of judgment, is going to declare it. Same idea exactly. Do you remember
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.560]   how in telling them even about the communion service in the eleventh chapter of that first
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.360]   epistle to the Corinthians, he tells them that there are many who are sick and many
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:07.760]   who have even died, many who sleep, because they have forgotten all this. They have not
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.400]   judged themselves. They have been coming to the communion table, but they have not been
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.960]   living the Christian life. They have been hating some fellow Christians. They have
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   not been living in the right relationship. They have been taking advantage. For this
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:26.160]   cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. They have forgotten the judgment
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.800]   of God. So he says, "Examine yourselves. Let every man examine himself. For if you
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.240]   judge yourselves, ye shall not be judged. But if you judge yourselves, you shall not
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:42.000]   be condemned with the world." There it is again.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.240]   Then when you come to his second epistle to the Corinthians, you will find he has it again
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:55.680]   in that second chapter. "We are a saver of life unto life and of death unto death.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.680]   Our message divides people," says Paul. "It confirms some in their position of wrath
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:08.560]   and damnation, its life and everything else to others." And then, of course, in that
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.280]   great and notable statement in the fifth chapter of 2 Corinthians, you have got it absolutely
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:20.920]   plainly and clearly. Why does he preach as he does? Well, you remember the answer. "It
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.960]   isn't only that the love of Christ constraineth us, but these things must always go together,
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:31.920]   love on one hand and what else. We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:37.080]   and give an account of the deeds done in the body, knowing therefore the terror of the
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:44.360]   Lord," says this man who knew his love so bountifully. "Knowing therefore the terror
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:50.520]   of the Lord." My friends, this idea has gone out of our churches, hasn't it? Not only
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.560]   of the unbelievers or the modernists, but out of evangelical churches. We are bright
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.360]   and breezy. Come and join us and have a good time. We crack our jokes to put people right
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:09.560]   as we begin to evangelize. "The terror of the Lord," says this man. The knowledge
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   that he will have to stand before that judgment seat. Haven't we departed rather far from
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:24.480]   this man and his method? You see what happens if you don't start where Paul starts? Your
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:31.040]   whole method becomes wrong. You are interested in attracting people and entertaining them,
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:37.720]   instead of confronting them with this thing with which we must all start. Or else we are
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:45.640]   in terrible danger. Go on to the epistle to the Ephesians. And there it is again in that
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:51.400]   second chapter in the third verse, "Among whom we all had our conversation in times
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:59.480]   past, in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:07.520]   and were by nature"—what?—"the children of wrath, even as others." It is everywhere,
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.880]   my friends. This man could not speak of the gospel without bringing it in. Listen to him
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.840]   again in Ephesians 5, 6 and the parallel in Colossians 3, 6. "Because of these things
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:24.640]   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." Have you ever read 1 Thessalonians
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:31.240]   5? "The day of the Lord shall so come as a thief in the night." "Be ready," he says.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.760]   You know not when it will come. He says that to Christians and to unbelievers. And have
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:42.200]   you ever read the first chapter of his second epistle to the Thessalonians? "When the Lord
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:49.280]   shall come having his vengeance upon all who are opposed to him, and all ungodliness in
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:55.200]   flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.360]   of our Lord Jesus Christ." And do you remember what he says to the Thessalonians in that
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:07.320]   first epistle at the end? He says, "Everybody knows about you. They themselves show us of
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.760]   what mannering of entering in we had unto you, and how he turned unto God from idols
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:18.320]   to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:24.040]   the dead, even Jesus." What about Jesus? What has he done? "Which delivered us from
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:33.840]   the wrath to come." You see, these men everywhere can't keep away from this message, this great
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:40.920]   truth, this vital doctrine. "Ah, wait a minute," says someone. "I think you've established
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.600]   abundantly that the apostle Paul at dinner had always preached it. But I wonder," says
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.280]   someone, "whether it was a message only that Paul emphasized. Is it confined to Paul? Is
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.920]   it that he was just legalistic? Is it this rabbinical tradition that he's still being
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:03.640]   governed by? Wait a minute. Try the epistle to the Hebrews and see what you find there.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:09.960]   Well, you won't have gone further than the second chapter before you read this. "Therefore
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:15.280]   we are to give them our earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:22.000]   we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels were steadfast, and every transgression
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.680]   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:38.480]   so great salvation?" Escape? There it is still, you see. You'll find it in the third
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.280]   chapter of Hebrews. You'll find it in the fourth chapter. "The trouble with the children
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.160]   of Israel in the wilderness was that they didn't believe this, and that was why they
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:53.080]   perished. They didn't believe the message about God and his eternal holiness, and that
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:59.120]   is why they were overcome in the wilderness." Have you ever read the sixth chapter of Hebrews?
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:05.800]   Of course you have. "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.960]   tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:16.520]   the good word of God and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, to
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:24.080]   renew them again unto repentance. The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh after
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:29.480]   upon it, bringeth forth herbs, meat for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:36.280]   from God. But that which bringeth thorns and browers is rejected, and nigh unto cursing,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:45.440]   whose end is to be burned." And then go on to chapter ten of Hebrews, and there it is
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:52.000]   again in most notable language. "If we sin willfully, what is it? Well, there's nothing
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.280]   but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.200]   adversaries." And then you remember that section we read at the beginning, from the
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:11.840]   twelfth chapter beginning at verse twenty-five. "See that he refuse not him that speaketh.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:22.000]   Our God is a consuming fire." And listen to James addressing the rich men. "Be careful,"
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.880]   he says, "the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." "Don't make any mistake about it," he said.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:38.960]   "Be careful, the judge standeth before the door." The wrath of God. You remember it,
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:45.640]   don't you, in the first epistle of Peter? He's got most solemn words for all of us.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.280]   He says, "The time is come, the judgment must begin at the house of God, and if it
[00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.680]   begin at us, what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel? And if the righteous
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:03.520]   scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner come in?" That's how Peter
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:15.680]   puts it, same doctrine. "Humble yourselves," he says in the next chapter, "under the mighty
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:23.080]   hand of God." Have you ever read chapters two and three of the second epistle of Peter,
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.920]   where he talks about the angels that kept not their first estate being kept in reserve
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:32.400]   for this wrath that's coming and all who belong to them? Have you read his third chapter of
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.160]   that second epistle? When he deals with this day of judgment, the day of the Lord, the
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:44.680]   day of the manifestation of the wrath of God, it's the whole chapter given to him. "A thousand
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:51.840]   days, a thousand days with the Lord, a thousand years are but one day, and one day is a thousand
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.600]   years. The Lord is not slack concerning his promises. These things are going to happen,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.480]   whatever the scoffers may say." It's the same doctrine. You'll find it in the epistle of
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:13.520]   Jude, and the whole of the book of Revelation is given to it. That's what it's all about.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:23.320]   The vows being poured forth, the trumpets being sounded. It's all about this. The wrath
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:29.960]   of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, entering with that tremendous statement
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:35.640]   at the end that the gates of heaven are shut against certain people, nothing vile or unclean
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:42.000]   shall come in. Outside are murderers and sorcerers and adulterers and all the rest of them. The
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.040]   wrath of God. The whole book is given to it. Judgment and the wrath of God.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:55.280]   And if you go and examine the preaching of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, as I've
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.480]   already told you, you'll find it everywhere. What Peter said to those people on the day
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:06.000]   of Pentecost, you'll see it in Acts 2.40, was this, "Save yourselves from this untoward
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.600]   generation." He didn't say, "Come along and have a good time with us. What a happy crowd
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:18.320]   we are. All your problems will be solved. Come along." Not at all. "Save yourselves from
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:26.160]   this untoward generation. Flee from the wrath to come." It was a message of repentance.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.120]   Stephen preaches the same thing. Read chapter 7 of Acts. Paul preaches it in Antioch of
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.160]   Pisidia. Read chapter 13. And when he's addressing the Stoics and the Epicureans on Mars Hill
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:44.240]   in Athens, what does he say? "The times of this ignorance God winked at, but now commendeth
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:51.960]   all men everywhere to repent." Not to come and have a good time and be wonderfully happy
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:58.200]   and join us in singing and in laughter and in jollification. Not at all. "He commendeth
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.320]   all men everywhere to repent." Why? "He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.200]   whole world in righteousness by the man whom he hath appointed, whereof he has given evidence
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:15.560]   in that he hath raised him again from the dead." It doesn't matter where you go. You
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.800]   find it everywhere. As I've already reminded you, it was the message of the herald John
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:27.880]   the Baptist. It was the message of our blessed Lord himself. "Repent," he says. He went and
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.920]   preached everywhere that men should repent. He sent out his apostles and told them to
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.760]   preach the same thing. He preaches it in the Sermon on the Mount, chapter 7 of Matthew.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.040]   Have you read it? The house and the rock and the sand, the types of prophets, the tree
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:49.520]   being examined, good fruit, bad fruit. It's always this. And then he says, "And when occasion
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:55.720]   fear not them that destroy the body, but after that have nothing that they can do. But I
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.920]   rather say unto you, fear him that hath power to destroy both soul and body in hell. Yea,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:10.160]   I say unto you, fear him." Do you remember his references to Sodom and Gomorrah? Read
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:16.720]   chapter 11 of Matthew's Gospel. "Woe unto thee, Pharisee! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!"
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's going to be better for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for you. And the
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.280]   same with other cities. Even Tyre and Sidon will have a better fate than they shall have.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:35.400]   Have you read Matthew 24 and 25? It's all about this. Given entirely to this mighty
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.160]   doctrine of God as judge. And then go to Luke 16 and listen to him speaking about divies
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:48.280]   and Lazarus, the rich men divies in hell and Lazarus, and the gall fixed, and the impossibility
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:53.920]   of moving, or a chance after death. No, no such thing. Once and forever, a great gulf
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:44:04.680]   fixed. Judgment has been passed. Why, it's even in John 3, 16. "God so loved the world
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:12.200]   that he gave his only begotten Son. Why, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish."
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:17.960]   That's the first thing you see. Always that first. Not have a good time, but not perish.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:24.720]   That's the immediate thing. But have everlasting life. And then in John 3, 36 we are told,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.800]   "The man doesn't believe. The wrath of God abides on him." Our Lord repeats this in John
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:37.560]   12. He says, "The word he preaches is going to judge them in that day." And his constant
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:44.760]   statements about the place where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. It's
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:54.680]   all, my friends, just a repetition of this great message of the wrath of God. I mustn't
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:01.440]   keep you, but that's the biblical testimony. And if you read the accounts of the lives
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.840]   and the preaching of the greatest evangelist that the church has ever known, you'll find
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.800]   they've all repeated it. It doesn't matter who they were. It isn't only a John Calvin
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:18.000]   and a John Knox, whom you may regard as firm, legal men. Martin Luther preached it. Augustine
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.880]   preached it. They've all preached it. The saintly, lovable Whitefield preached it. John
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.440]   Wesley preached it. Have you read the sermon of Jonathan Edwards on sinners in the hands
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:41.480]   of an angry God? Oh, how God used it to convert, yes, young people as well as older people.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:47.640]   What has the age to do with this? What has the passing of centuries to do with this?
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.240]   God doesn't change. He's still the same consuming fire. And unless people come to
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.000]   him because they want to know him and to live his kind of life, there's no point in their
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.400]   coming. The business of the gospel is to bring people to God and to reconcile them to God.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:12.000]   Not to fill churches, not to have good statistics, but to reconcile men to God, to save them
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   from the wrath to come.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:26.080]   I say, therefore, that if our evangelizing and our evangelism is to be scriptural, we
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:42.960]   must, with the apostle Paul, always and invariably, start with this. For the wrath of God has
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:55.280]   been revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. I confess freely,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:05.120]   I cannot understand a jocular evangelist. I cannot understand anyone who believes this
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   doctrine for any reason or for any motive, being light or considering men, rather than
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:26.880]   the truth and the power of the Holy Ghost to apply it. You go back and read the lives
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:34.360]   of the men whom, as I say, God has used in the mightiest manner, and you will invariably
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:42.400]   find that they've been serious men, sober men, men with a fear of the Lord, knowing
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:49.720]   the terror of the Lord, they all say with the apostle Paul. They were not afraid what
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:57.400]   people might think of it. They were only afraid of what God might think of it. And so they
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:03.960]   started with it and proclaimed it and God yielded it.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:12.160]   And those believing the gospel because of it began to experience the wondrous blessings
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:20.720]   of peace and joy, deliverance and power, and began to have glimpses of that blessed and
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:32.680]   everlasting hope. Oh may God give us such a realization of this mighty, tremendous,
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:46.600]   awe-inspiring truth that we, in our day and generation, shall become more like these men
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:57.520]   and so minister to the glory of the only true and living God. Amen.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
