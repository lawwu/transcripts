[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.440]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.460]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.560]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.340]   Today, we are discussing grief.
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.880]   Grief is a natural emotion that most everybody experiences
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.280]   at some point in their life.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.600]   However, grief is something
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.840]   that still mystifies most people.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.160]   For instance, we often wonder why getting over the loss
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   of somebody or a pet is so absolutely crushing.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   In some cases, it's obvious
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.840]   because we had a very close relationship
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720]   to that person or animal.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360]   But in other cases, it's bewildering
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.900]   because somehow, despite our best efforts,
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.880]   we are unable to reframe and shift our mind
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.800]   to the idea that the person or animal
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.640]   that at one point was here and so very present is now gone.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.940]   Today, we are going to discuss how we conceptualize grief,
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.980]   both at an emotional and at a logical level.
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.860]   I'm going to teach you about the neuroscience
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.600]   and the psychology of grief and incredible findings
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.760]   that have been made in just a few key laboratories
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.580]   that point to the fact that we essentially map
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.920]   our experience of people in three dimensions.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.100]   Let's just give you a little hint
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.720]   of what those dimensions are.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.480]   They relate to space, where people are,
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.580]   time, when people are, I'll explain what that means,
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.160]   and a dimension called closeness
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.840]   and how those three dimensions of space, time, and closeness
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.100]   are what establish very close bonds with people
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.400]   and are what require remapping,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880]   reorganization within our emotional framework
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.000]   and our logical framework when we lose somebody
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500]   for whatever reason.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200]   Within that understanding,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.600]   I'm confident that you will have greater insight
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.640]   into the grief process.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.580]   And should you ever find yourself within the grief process,
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.160]   as I imagine most everyone will at some point,
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   you will be able to navigate that process
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.240]   in what psychologists and neuroscientists deem to be
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   the most healthy way of going through grief.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.280]   Indeed, moving through grief requires a specific form
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.920]   of neuroplasticity, a reordering of brain connections,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   and also the connections between the brain and body.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.740]   I'm going to teach you about all of that today.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.000]   So you're going to learn a lot of scientific information.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.620]   You will also learn a lot of tools
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.000]   that you can put in your kit of emotional
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720]   and really emotional physical tools
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.280]   that will allow you to move through grief
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.080]   in this healthy way that I referred to earlier.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.800]   I'll also point out some of the myths about grief.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.280]   For instance, many of you have probably heard
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.320]   that there are designated stages of grief
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.040]   that everybody moves through.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.760]   It turns out that recent research refutes that idea.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.120]   There are different stages of grief,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.380]   but not everybody experiences all of them.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.060]   And hardly ever does somebody move through
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.740]   all of those linearly, meaning in the same order.
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.860]   I also want to point out that for many of you
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.980]   that are not experiencing grief in this moment,
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.540]   there's an important scientific literature
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.100]   that teaches us that how we show up to grief,
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.640]   meaning our psychological and our biological state
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.320]   that we happen to be in when a loss occurs,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.480]   strongly dictates whether or not we end up
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.800]   in what's called complicated or non-complicated grief.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.120]   And non-complicated grief is a form of grief
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.680]   that is very prolonged.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.880]   And in fact, often requires that people get
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.860]   substantial professional help.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.080]   So whether or not you're experiencing grief,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.160]   that's mild, moderate, or very intense right now,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.080]   or whether or not you are not experiencing any grief at all,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   you're going to learn scientific information and tools
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.720]   that will help you navigate through this process
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.360]   that we call grief.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.000]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.920]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.120]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   about science and science-related tools
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.620]   to the general public.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.520]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.080]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.820]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.960]   that have cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600]   I recently started sleeping
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.880]   with an Eight Sleep mattress cover,
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.160]   and I am so glad that I did
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.940]   because the sleep that I'm getting is superb
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.800]   compared to the sleep I was getting previously.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.520]   I always thought that I slept pretty well,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.600]   especially since I apply a number of different tools
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.820]   in order to sleep well,
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.760]   things like supplements,
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.960]   things like keeping the room cool, et cetera,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.760]   but I have had a repeating problem over the years,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.040]   which is that I would wake up
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.520]   in the middle of the night often
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.600]   and sometimes have a bit of trouble
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.520]   or a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.600]   I would have to apply other tools
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.300]   in order to get back to sleep.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.680]   Eight Sleep allows me to adjust the temperature
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.880]   of my mattress and my sleeping environment
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.440]   so that I fall asleep easily
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.340]   and stay asleep throughout the night,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.480]   which as many of you know, is a game changer.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.560]   Temperature is a powerful regulator of sleep
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.840]   and the ability to get into sleep.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   We know for instance,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.760]   that the body needs to drop by one to three degrees
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.840]   in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.780]   And with Eight Sleep,
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.520]   I can program the temperature of my bed
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.280]   so that it gets cooler as I fall asleep,
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.020]   gets even colder as I enter deep sleep
[00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.960]   and at the transition to REM sleep,
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.380]   rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.000]   it can get even cooler if I like.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.640]   I actually like to maintain the same temperature
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.960]   through deep and REM sleep.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.720]   And then it heats up slightly as I head towards morning
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.380]   because of course heating up of the body
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.760]   is one way in which we wake up.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.480]   So I have this nice contour of cooling and heating
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.240]   that puts me through a beautiful arc
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.200]   of falling and staying asleep and waking up when I want to.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.400]   If you want to try Eight Sleep,

[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.180]   now through June 6th.
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.100]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.600]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.020]   to help you better understand your body
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.140]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.120]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.240]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.480]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.000]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.880]   And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.920]   you can also get insight into, for instance,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.360]   what your biological age is
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.560]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.880]   And of course your biological age
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.360]   is the number that truly matters.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.840]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.780]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.560]   is that you get values back about metabolic factors,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.680]   hormones and lipids, et cetera,
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.120]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.760]   Inside Tracker solves that problem.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.400]   They have a very easy to use personalized platform.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.340]   It's a website where you can literally place your cursor
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.440]   over a given value, say for a hormone
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   or metabolic factor or lipid.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.320]   And it will tell you what you can do
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.800]   in terms of nutrition, behaviors and supplementation
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.760]   in order to bring those values into the range
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.200]   that are optimal for you and your health.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.280]   Find this immensely useful and very easy to use.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.680]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.440]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.160]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.320]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.080]   that are the absolute highest quality
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.840]   and have extreme versatility
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.800]   in terms of what they can be used for
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.080]   and when you wear them.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   What do I mean by that?
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   Well, the company was founded
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.980]   and their goal was to develop eyeglasses for performance,
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.920]   things like running and biking and so forth.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.240]   And you can certainly wear them for those activities.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.140]   And I do wear them for those activities.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.960]   I wear readers at night.
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.060]   I also wear sunglasses sometimes when it's very bright out.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.080]   One of the things that's terrific
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.120]   about Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses, however,
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.080]   is that they're not just designed for sport.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.640]   They have a terrific aesthetic,
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.160]   and you can also wear them out to dinner,
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.920]   to work and so on.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.080]   I say this because at least in my opinion,
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.360]   a lot of so-called sport eyeglasses
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.100]   or high-performance eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.640]   make people look like cyborgs.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.200]   Roca, the aesthetic is really terrific.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.320]   They're extremely lightweight,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.400]   and they don't slip off even when you're sweaty.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.760]   So you can indeed wear them on a hot day
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.200]   or when running or cycling.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.280]   They're not going to slip off your face.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.300]   They're so lightweight, in fact,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   that I often forget that they're on my face.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.920]   If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.680]   go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,

[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.560]   Okay, let's talk about grief.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.720]   I just want to remind you that everybody,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.120]   at some point in their life, experiences grief,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.160]   either mild grief, moderate grief, or extreme grief.
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.800]   And it's somewhat obvious, but worth stating nonetheless,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.360]   that how intense grief feels and how long it lasts
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.320]   scales with how close we were with somebody.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.040]   And if you learn that the person who works
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.120]   at the coffee shop or that you see at the coffee shop
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.500]   on a regular basis happened to pass away
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.140]   or tragically get killed in a car accident,
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.400]   that can be quite upsetting.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.080]   It can be somewhat disorienting to you if you,
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.840]   for instance, just saw them yesterday,
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.060]   or they seemed perfectly fine when you saw them last.
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.000]   But of course, the grief that results
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.600]   from the loss of somebody to whom you have
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.880]   that level of attachment is far and away different
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.640]   than the level of grief that you would experience
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.080]   from the death of a very close loved one,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.180]   a sibling, a parent, God forbid, a child.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.900]   When that type of loss occurs, it's often the case
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.640]   that our entire relationship to life feels different.
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.780]   Places and things that at once brought us joy and laughter
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.400]   now bring the opposite.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.040]   They bring us intense feelings of sadness and loss.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.240]   Psychologists and neuroscientists distinguish
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.580]   between complicated grief and non-complicated grief.
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.360]   They are very similar at the outset.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.500]   One of the fundamental differences between them, however,
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.960]   is that complicated grief, which occurs in about one
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.640]   in 10 people, is a situation in which grief does not seem
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.660]   to resolve itself even after a prolonged period of time.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.040]   Later in the episode, I'll point you
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.480]   to the actual tests that are used.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.900]   I've provided links to those in the show note captions
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.620]   that will allow you to distinguish
[00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.900]   between complicated and non-complicated grief.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.160]   These arrive through the important research
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.300]   of the world-class grief researchers that are out there
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.600]   and the psychologists that treat grief.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.620]   The important thing to point out is that grief is a process.
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.760]   Like any biological or psychological event,
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.280]   it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.560]   And I do believe that being able to orient in terms
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.580]   of where you are in that process can be immensely beneficial,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.120]   not just for predicting how long it's going to last,
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.480]   but in order to conceptualize the person or animal
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.260]   that you lost in a way that allows you
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.780]   to best preserve their memory
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.060]   while maintaining your own functional capacity in life.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.020]   Along those lines, I want to point out
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.900]   that grief and depression,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.140]   while they can feel quite similar in certain ways
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.300]   and have overlapping symptomology, loss of appetite,
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.560]   challenges sleeping, crying in the middle of the day
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.480]   for no apparent reason, et cetera,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.140]   they are distinctly different processes.
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.320]   The modern research teaches us, for instance,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.620]   that grief rarely responds well to antidepressants,
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.320]   whereas depression can often respond well
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.380]   to antidepressants.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.440]   Everything we know and understand about grief is
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.020]   that it is a distinct psychological and physiological event
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.300]   in the brain and body from depression.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.460]   Rather, perhaps the best way to think about grief is
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.480]   that it is actually a motivational state.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.140]   It is a yearning, it is a desire for something.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.180]   And somewhat surprisingly, it's not just a desire
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.940]   to have that person back or to have that animal back.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.620]   You might think, well, that's crazy, of course it is.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.460]   But of course, there are instances
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.180]   in which someone passing away or an animal passing away
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.100]   is actually providing relief for that person
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.400]   because of where they happen to be in their life.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   Today, I'll teach you about grief as a motivational process
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.440]   because grief as a motivational process really is the way
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.640]   that scientists and psychologists now conceptualize grief
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.820]   and the treatments for grief
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.120]   so that people can move through them effectively.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.620]   As we wade into this important topic,
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.620]   I'd like to emphasize some of the common myths
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.900]   and misunderstandings about grief.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.940]   Some of the myths and misunderstanding arrive
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.060]   from the beautiful work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross,
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.740]   a psychologist who wrote the famous book
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.180]   on death and dying.
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.040]   And I should emphasize that while Kubler-Ross
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.380]   was a real pioneer in establishing
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.380]   that there are indeed different stages of grief,
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.860]   the modern science, both psychology and neuroscience,
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.060]   point to the fact that not everybody experiences
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.660]   all of the stages that Kubler-Ross defined,
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.820]   nor do they move through those stages in a linear manner.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.820]   Sometimes they're out of sequence.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.500]   I'll just highlight the five stages
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.160]   that Kubler-Ross illustrated
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.220]   because some people really do experience all of them.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.820]   Sometimes in the order I'll read them,
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.660]   but again, oftentimes they don't.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.540]   The different stages of grief very quickly are denial,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.540]   anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.900]   In the Kubler-Ross model, denial is always the first stage.
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.700]   And denial is just as it sounds,
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.120]   this disbelief, it cannot be, there's no way,
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.740]   a refusal to accept the new reality
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.880]   that the person or animal is gone.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.820]   The second stage, anger, is one in which
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.540]   the individual recognizes that the person is indeed gone
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.620]   or the animal is gone,
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.080]   but their body and their mind go into a motivated state.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.920]   This is important.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.780]   We're going to return to this idea of grief
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.940]   as a motivated state that involves action plans
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.940]   in more depth as we go further.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.540]   And then the third stage is bargaining,
[00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.940]   what's sometimes called the negotiating phase.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.880]   This idea that, well, if I had just done this,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.140]   or if they had just done that, or if I'd called more,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.180]   or somehow refusing to accept the reality,
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.940]   so in a way this can be blended with denial in thinking,
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.340]   well, if I just don't think about it, it won't be real,
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.160]   this kind of thing.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.940]   So again, stages can be blended or braided together
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.740]   because emotions are complex, right?
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.600]   Even though there are different stages to this process,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.460]   they can sometimes be melded together.
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.820]   The fourth stage of depression that Kubler-Ross described
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.780]   is one of why go on living?
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.020]   Why should I go on living?
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.900]   Why should I continue in this grief-stricken state
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.580]   that seems to deprive me of all the richness of life
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.400]   that I experienced when the person or animal was still here?
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.900]   And then the fifth stage is acceptance,
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.700]   this internalization, not just cognitively,
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.460]   not just thinking, but emotionally that it's going to be okay
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.300]   that not just this too shall pass, but that it has passed.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.860]   So again, the five stages of grief that Kubler-Ross defined
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.340]   were immensely important as a critical parsing
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.180]   of the different stages that one could move through.
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.460]   But unfortunately, those five stages were sort of taken
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.300]   to be gospel for a long time.
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.020]   And we now know based on neuroimaging,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.620]   based on more in-depth psychological evaluation,
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.520]   and frankly, more researchers and clinicians
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.460]   moving into this area and observing
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.340]   that while much of what Kubler-Ross described
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.020]   does hold true, it's not always the case.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.700]   And in fact, the contour of the grief process
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.180]   actually has a lot of dimensions
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.960]   that are not encapsulated by those five stages.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.260]   There's also a lot of variation
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.140]   depending on whether or not the loss is due to old age,
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.300]   disease, whether or not there was suffering prior or not,
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.540]   suicide or non-suicide types, deaths and losses,
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.600]   and even grief about non-death losses,
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.380]   a relationship breakup or something of that sort,
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.100]   or even homesickness and things of that sort.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.900]   So I do want to tip our hats to the incredible work
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.660]   of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.020]   By no means am I or do other researchers
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.620]   try and discount her incredible contributions,
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.940]   but I think nowadays we have a different
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.880]   and frankly, a better understanding
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.760]   of what the grief process is like,
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.140]   and as a consequence, better tools to move through grief.
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.540]   In order to really understand what grief is
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.300]   in your brain and body and how to best navigate grief,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.920]   I'd like you to do an experiment with me.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.060]   For the next five minutes or so,
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.780]   I'd like you to at least try to discard
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.780]   of all prior notions of grief as just a state of sadness.
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.940]   I want to acknowledge that it is and does involve sadness,
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.040]   but for right now, let's think about grief
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.820]   as a motivational state, as a desire for something specific.
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.500]   In fact, I'd like you to think about grief
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.660]   as an attempt to reach out and get something
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.340]   that you very much want.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.240]   Imagine yourself extremely thirsty, for instance,
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.940]   on a very hot day,
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.120]   and a glass of water is right in front of you,
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.800]   and it's a beautiful, clean glass of water,
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.520]   and it's completely full,
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.680]   and you so badly want to drink that water,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.480]   but no matter how intensely you want it,
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.780]   and no matter how hard you try and reach it,
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.200]   it always shifts just outside your reach.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.780]   So if you can imagine that, even just a little bit,
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.700]   you are touching into the experience of grief.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.060]   How do I know this?
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.540]   Well, I know this because brain imaging studies
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.340]   involving what's called functional magnetic
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.940]   resonance imaging, fMRI, in which you can evaluate
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.100]   which brain areas are more active than others
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.280]   according to blood flow,
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.880]   which correlates with neural activity and so forth,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.220]   teaches us that the brain areas that are associated
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.420]   with motivation and craving and pursuit
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.300]   are some of the primary brain areas and circuits
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.460]   that are activated in states of grief.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.120]   I'd like to share an important paper with you
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.060]   as one of the first to illustrate the fact
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.820]   that grief is not just a state of sadness and pain.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.340]   It is indeed a state of yearning and desire
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.180]   of something that is just outside your reach
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.460]   and unfortunately will always be just outside your reach
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.780]   until you remap your relationship to that person or thing.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.660]   The title of this paper is posed first as a question,
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.200]   so that's why I'll read it as such.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.180]   The title is Craving Love.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.940]   Enduring Grief Activates Brain's Reward Center.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.580]   And the first author of this paper is Mary Frances O'Connor.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.440]   She's a professor of psychology
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.520]   at the University of Arizona and one of the world leaders
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.020]   in the study of grief from a neuroscience perspective.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.160]   With some luck, we'll get her here
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.620]   on the podcast as a guest.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.880]   Now, this paper has several important features.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.220]   I'll just highlight a few.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.980]   One of the features of this paper that's not surprising
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.820]   is they found that people who are in a state of grief
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.980]   are in a state of pain.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.080]   That is, brain areas associated with pain,
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.680]   actual physical pain, are more active
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.740]   than in non-grieving individuals.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.240]   However, they also found that people who are experiencing
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   what's called complicated grief showed reward-related
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.820]   activity in a brain area called the nucleus accumbens.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.300]   What is reward-related activity?
[00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.140]   Reward-related activity is activity of neurons
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.220]   that's associated with motivational states.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.780]   And the nucleus accumbens is a brain center
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.160]   in which dopamine has the effect
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.700]   of creating a motivated state.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.140]   If ever you thought that dopamine was only associated
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.640]   with feeling good, you hear about dopamine hits.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.260]   Well, this paper and papers like it
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.000]   firmly tell us that dopamine is not about feeling good.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.500]   Dopamine is about placing us into a state
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.540]   of desiring things and seeking things.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.280]   This is true in addiction.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.000]   This is true when we're hungry and we want to eat.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.620]   This is true when we want to reproduce.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.580]   This is true in every state in which we are reaching
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.380]   for something outside our immediate ability
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.220]   to give that thing to ourselves.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.380]   This is very important to understand
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.740]   if you want to understand grief
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.460]   and how to move through grief.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.660]   Grief is not just about sadness.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.220]   It is a state of sadness,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.340]   hence the activation of brain areas associated with pain.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.340]   And it is a state of desire and reaching for something.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.660]   And for those of you that have experienced grief,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.460]   I think that will resonate with you.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:22.320]   In that understanding that grief is both a state of pain,
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.040]   but also a state of wanting,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.240]   and in the understanding that when we lose somebody,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.960]   either because of breakup or because of death,
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   or if an animal dies or gets taken away or is missing,
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.900]   that state of wanting and desire drives
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.220]   an activation state within us.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.860]   Now, the key thing to understand is that the activation
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.560]   of those reward centers and the involvement of dopamine
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.420]   puts us into an anticipatory state,
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.900]   a state of waiting for something to happen.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.240]   It also puts us into a state of action or desiring action.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.260]   Our body and our mind are what I like to refer to
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.020]   as center of mass forward.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.480]   We are seeking how to resolve the craving,
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   even if we know that is impossible.
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.420]   Why do I say that?
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.700]   Well, we understand also on the basis
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.480]   of brain imaging studies and also some studies in animals
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.240]   that I'll describe in a moment,
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.900]   that in order to understand grief,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.820]   we have to understand how attachments
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.340]   are represented in our brain.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.040]   And it turns out that both attachments
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.880]   and the breaking of attachments in healthy ways
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.460]   are governed by three important, what we call dimensions.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.580]   A dimension is just some feature of the world
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.840]   that's represented in our brain.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.680]   So for instance, the color red doesn't exist in your brain.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   You happen to have cells, neurons in your eye
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.620]   that respond best to long wavelengths of light.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.400]   And those long wavelengths of light happen to be
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.320]   what are reflected off things that are perceived as red.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.820]   So in your mind, you have a notion of red.
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.280]   I know this is a little bit abstract,
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.760]   but you're not actually lighting up red neurons
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.040]   in your brain and that's why you see red.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.280]   You are lighting up neurons in your brain
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.740]   that represent the presence of red things
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.280]   in your environment.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.880]   Similarly, we have neurons and maps,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.780]   or we say representations of other dimensions.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.920]   We have dimensions of touch.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.580]   We have dimensions of sound.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:32.440]   And as I'll now teach you, we have three dimensions
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.380]   that define our relationship
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.940]   to people and animals and things.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.460]   And when those people, animals and things
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.120]   are within our immediate vicinity,
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.740]   or if we know how we could access them, right?
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.660]   If somebody is still alive,
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.020]   there's generally some way to access them
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.140]   unless they're refusing to interact with us.
[00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.420]   Well, when we understand that,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.180]   our motivational states can operate
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.400]   in a way that's logical.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.460]   We know that, for instance,
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.220]   if we want to find our mother, brother, sister,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.540]   significant other, dog, cat, parrot, et cetera,
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.380]   we have to go through a certain set of steps.
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.900]   What are those three dimensions and how do they work?
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.560]   And that's what I'm going to teach you now.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.860]   So at risk of sounding a little bit too reductionist,
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.540]   we are now going to describe your relationship
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.380]   to anything, everything, and anyone
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.880]   in these three dimensions.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.440]   How can we do that?
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.740]   Why would we even want to do that?
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.800]   Why would we want to rob the complexity of relationships
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.420]   of their contour and their detail?
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.140]   Well, if we can understand the dimensions
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.460]   in which we map our relationship to people,
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.100]   animals and things, then we can understand why it is
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.700]   that when those people, animals or things
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.300]   are not accessible to us, why it hurts so much
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.540]   and why it takes a certain amount of time
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.740]   in order to re-understand, if you will,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.940]   or re-map our association to them.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.380]   I promise that in grasping the information
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.820]   I'm about to give you, you will be able
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.060]   to better orient in the grief process
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.420]   and you'll be able to move through it more effectively.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.600]   The three dimensions of relating to someone
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   or an animal or a thing are space, time, and closeness.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.240]   And in order to illustrate each one
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.820]   and how they work together to support relationships
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.140]   and their involvement in the grieving process,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.720]   I'm going to tell you about an experiment.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.080]   This experiment was actually done.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   The experiment involves putting people into a brain scanner
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.700]   that allows the researcher to evaluate brain activity
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.540]   in different areas.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.060]   In fact, can look in a very non-biased way,
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.880]   not make any predictions about which brain areas
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.520]   are going to be involved.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.000]   And the experiment is the following.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.300]   The person, I should say the research subject,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.380]   first sees images of things that reside
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.000]   at different distances from one another.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.620]   And when I say things, these are objects.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.700]   So in one case, it's a beach or a parking lot
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.040]   with bowling balls set at different distances
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:14.900]   from one another.
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.240]   Their brain is imaged and as their brain is imaged,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.340]   they see different pictures of different scenes,
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.380]   the beach, the parking lot, et cetera,
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.700]   bowling balls spaced in different ways,
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.000]   close together, far apart, regularly spaced,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.180]   non-regularly spaced.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.460]   When one does this sort of experiment,
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.780]   you see a lot of brain areas activated,
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.480]   not surprisingly the visual cortex,
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.020]   the area of the brain that is responsible
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.840]   for creating visual perceptions,
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.060]   but also a brain area that seems uniquely tuned
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.380]   to the distance between you and the objects.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.340]   So whether or not the bowling balls are far away
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.840]   or close together from one another,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.640]   and whether or not they are far away
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.200]   or close to you physically.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.960]   So literally the distance between you and these objects,
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.640]   we'll refer to that measure, that dimension,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.880]   as we call it as proximity, okay?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.560]   Whether or not it's very close to you,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.720]   high degree of proximity or far away, low proximity,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.540]   but it's simply physical space.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.220]   Then subjects listen to tones.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.000]   Those tones also are spaced from one another.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.720]   So it could be something as simple as my hand
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.360]   meeting the table top that I'm happened to be sitting
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   in front of, so it's.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.360]   They image the brain.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.220]   Of course, areas of the brain that are associated
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.160]   with auditory perception are active, not surprisingly,
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.620]   but as they evaluate different types of sounds
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.960]   and patterns of sounds, for instance,
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   they can start to parse brain areas
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.040]   that seem uniquely tuned to the spacing of sounds
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.740]   independent of what sounds are coming in.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.960]   So whether or not it's musical notes
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.160]   or my hand hitting the table or human speech,
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.520]   they identified a brain region that is uniquely tuned.
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.860]   That is, it becomes active specifically in response
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.880]   to changes in the spacing between sounds,
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.460]   much in the same way as they could identify brain regions
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.960]   that were only activated when there were changes
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.080]   in the distance between objects, such as the bowling balls
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.320]   that I used in the previous example.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.860]   And then the subjects saw a different set of images.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.660]   The images that they saw were of people and of faces.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.400]   And some of the images that they saw
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.880]   were of people's faces right up close
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.540]   and other images were of people at a distance
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.920]   where you could see the whole body of the person.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.420]   Now, they also varied the emotional relationship
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.280]   to those people.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.880]   That is, they were able to get photographs
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.120]   from these research subjects lives.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.140]   So they could show them pictures of, for instance,
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.080]   their sister or some random person off the street.
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   They could show them pictures of a parent or of a neighbor
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.880]   or of a celebrity that's well-known
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.480]   or of somebody that they didn't know at all.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.120]   So they were able to vary both the position of the person,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.440]   close or far, and they were able to vary
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.840]   the emotional distance to the person,
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.520]   which is this dimension that I'm referring to as closeness,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.980]   which is not physical closeness,
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.580]   but how attached or how well you know somebody.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.180]   Now, this is maybe sounding
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.680]   like a somewhat complicated experiment,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.740]   but the takeaway from this experiment is exquisitely simple
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.260]   and exquisitely important.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.880]   The result was that in all three conditions,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.840]   changes in the physical spacing of these objects,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.400]   changes in the temporal,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.600]   that is the time spacing of these sounds,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.480]   and changes in the emotional distance
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.840]   between the subject and different people,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.080]   the same brain area was uniquely activated.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.360]   Now, that is an incredible thing to find
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.760]   because what it suggests is that, yes, of course,
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.160]   there are brain areas that are associated
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.140]   with representation of visual objects,
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.680]   and that, yes, of course, there are brain areas
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.960]   associated with representation of different sounds,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.180]   and of course, there are brain areas associated with faces.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.320]   We now know this.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.560]   In fact, there's something called the fusiform face area,
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.120]   which is uniquely tuned to faces,
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.040]   but at the same time, there is a unique brain region
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   that is activated in all three of the conditions I described
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.120]   that has to do with how far you are from somebody,
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.120]   both in space, in time, and in terms of emotional closeness,
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   and that brain area, it turns out,
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.200]   is a brain area called the inferior parietal lobule.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.540]   The inferior parietal lobule.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.960]   Now, you don't need to know
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.540]   where the inferior parietal lobule is.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.680]   In fact, you don't even need to know
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.500]   the name of this brain area.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.960]   What you do need to know, however,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.360]   if you want to understand grief
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.000]   and how to move through grief,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.520]   is that your map of people
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.840]   is not a map of emotional closeness per se.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.200]   It is a map of emotional closeness, what we call attachment,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.680]   that is interwoven, that is braided in,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.340]   in a very intimate way,
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.140]   with your map of where they are in physical space
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.320]   and where they are in time,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.400]   when you saw them last,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   when you're likely to see them again,
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.840]   and if you were to want to see them,
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.960]   how much time it would take to reach them
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.840]   or for them to reach you.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.160]   Now, earlier, I said that one of the key functions
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.560]   of our nervous system is to be able to make predictions,
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.560]   and so it's somewhat obvious, but nonetheless,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.000]   important to state and restate
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.280]   that one of the most powerful aspects
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.100]   of our attachments to people, animals and things,
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.160]   is our ability to predict
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.640]   what it would take to see them again
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.340]   and when we are going to see them again.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:57.340]   In fact, we could say that our ability to locate someone
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.920]   or an animal or thing in space and time, right,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.120]   where they are and how long it would take
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.060]   for us to reach them or them to reach us,
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.160]   is a prediction of the requirements
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.920]   to engage in the attachment.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.160]   In order to illustrate this at a little bit more depth,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.800]   let's just do a fill in the blank experiment.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.680]   You can do this now in real time.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.900]   I want you to think of somebody that you either rely on
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.760]   or that you care about very, very much,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.400]   and I'll just allow you to fill in the blank
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.420]   on this sentence.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.940]   If I want to see blank, the person or animal,
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.920]   I could see them within blank amount of time, right?
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.880]   If right now you wanted to see this person or animal
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.640]   or maybe even a thing,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.440]   how long would it take you to reach them?
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.920]   Could be a day, could be a second,
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.120]   could be there right next to you.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.080]   All you'd have to do is turn your head.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.560]   Now answer this.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.280]   If this person were to travel
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   halfway around the world and land in their plane,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.240]   I would expect to hear from them
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.680]   within blank minutes of them landing, okay?
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.720]   The answers of this of course will differ.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.420]   Now I'd like you to answer this question.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.240]   If I'd like to find myself,
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.400]   it would take me X amount of time.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.540]   And of course, if you're listening to this
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.600]   and you're understanding it and you're of a rational mind,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.120]   the answer to that should be zero seconds.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.960]   Instantaneous.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.800]   You are always able to locate yourself in space and time,
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.640]   provided you are in the appropriate state of mind,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.580]   meaning not asleep, for instance.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.160]   That last question might seem somewhat silly,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.720]   but it's a fundamentally important one
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.240]   because it illustrates the extremes
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.360]   at which we map our relationship to ourselves
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.800]   relative to other people and things.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.360]   Now, if all of this sounds like
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   a bunch of neuro psycho babble parsing of the obvious,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.600]   I'd encourage you to suspend that belief for the moment,
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.080]   because if you understand that all relationships
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.680]   are mapped in the brain and body
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.040]   through these three dimensions,
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.000]   space, time, and closeness, or proximity of space,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.040]   proximity in time, and proximity of attachment,
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.040]   how close or rich or bonded you are to someone,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.760]   well, if you can understand that,
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.480]   then it almost becomes obvious,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.560]   or at least it becomes intuitive as to why,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.040]   after the loss of somebody, in particular a death
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.840]   or the loss of an animal, this map has to be reordered.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.680]   Why?
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.880]   Because if we are attached to someone or an animal
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.000]   at a deep level, it is almost always on the basis
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.760]   of a lot of what we call episodic experience,
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.340]   a lot of episodic memories, memories of things that happen.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.720]   Episodic memories are literally the conscious recollection
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.920]   of your experience of somebody or an animal or a thing.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   And within that memory, you have an understanding
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.280]   of what has happened with them in association to you,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.680]   what's going on with them, where it happened,
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.140]   when it happened, you have a rich knowledge database
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.120]   that we call implicit knowledge, right?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.760]   You might not be aware of it all the time,
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.280]   but it's within you of what this person is like
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.120]   and what they're doing in their life.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.020]   When somebody is taken away from us for whatever reason,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.900]   episodic memories persist for some period of time,
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.440]   and they are still linked to our feelings of attachment.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.800]   Grief is the process of uncoupling, unbraiding,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.040]   and untangling that relationship between where people are
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.000]   in space, in time, and our attachment to them.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.500]   What I mean by this is when somebody or an animal
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.660]   or a thing is taken from us, either by decision
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   or by death or by circumstance, well, in that case,
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:02.100]   our entire memory bank and our ability to predict
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.640]   where and when they will be, and therefore,
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.440]   when we can feed our attachment to them again,
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.760]   that whole map is obliterated,
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.240]   except that the attachment itself has not been disrupted.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.600]   Assuming that you are deeply attached to someone
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   or an animal or a thing, that attachment persists,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.840]   and the grief process is one in which you have to reorder
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.300]   your understanding of them in space and in time.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.840]   This is very, very hard to do, and for some people,
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.600]   it's almost impossible to do,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   at least at the outset of grief.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.680]   This, in a very neurosciency way,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.040]   explains this stage that Kubler-Ross described,
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.760]   which many, again, not all, but many people experience,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.560]   which is one of denial.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.600]   How could it be?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.440]   Why?
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   Well, when we have a rich catalog of experiences
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.400]   with somebody or of them, right?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.720]   Ideas about them and what they do, how they spend their day,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.300]   what they do and don't do, where they do it, et cetera.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.760]   Well, that memory bank is not just flushed out
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.560]   the moment that we learn that they're no longer with us.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.960]   What happens is the brain continues to make
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.120]   these predictions that they will be in a certain place
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.720]   or a certain time, right?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.960]   That there'll be in a certain time zone
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.900]   or they'll walk in the door any moment.
[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.480]   All of those predictions still hold.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.040]   The neural activity continues.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.980]   We call this reverbatory activity.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.640]   That explains the yearning for and the desire to interact,
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.240]   and yet it's just beyond our reach because once they're gone
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.000]   our brain still functions in a way,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.380]   these neural circuits still function in a way
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.160]   that put us into an action state of seeking them,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.460]   looking for them in the same location,
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.060]   expecting them to contact us at whatever frequency
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.840]   that we were used to hearing from them
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.020]   or that we could reach out to them
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.920]   and reliably get a response.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.840]   It is immensely disorienting, in other words,
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.120]   to maintain a close attachment and at the same time,
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   to not be able to make predictions about where that person
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.000]   and more thing is in space and time.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.020]   Now, if this seems somewhat abstract,
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.880]   I'm going to continue to flush it out.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.980]   And actually right now I'd like to flush it out
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.940]   with a real world example of grief and loss
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.640]   that comes to us from perhaps one of the greatest minds
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.380]   in human history and somebody who was intensely grounded
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.340]   in reality and logic and indeed the physics of the world.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.320]   And the person I'm referring to is none other
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.200]   than the Nobel prize winning physicist, Richard Feynman.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.480]   Many of you are probably familiar with Richard Feynman.
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.940]   Some of you perhaps are not.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.780]   Richard Feynman was a Nobel prize winning physicist,
[00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.440]   known for his thick New York accent.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.160]   He was actually not from Brooklyn, as many people think.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.000]   He was actually from Far Rockaway in Long Island,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.080]   thick New York accent, very personable,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.640]   exceptional teacher, brilliant mind,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.280]   hence the Nobel prize in physics.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.680]   Also a quite funny and amusing person
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.600]   told great anecdotes, et cetera.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.760]   Feynman had a childhood sweetheart
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.920]   who turned out to be his first wife.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.440]   Her name was Arlene and it was well known
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.260]   that Feynman was absolutely in love with her.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.860]   He would talk about her all the time.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:18.600]   She had a profound influence on him and his thinking
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.700]   and ultimately on his public education efforts later.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.220]   If you haven't already read books such as
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.240]   "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman"
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.580]   or "What Do You Care What Other People Think?"
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.280]   I encourage you to do so and in fact, that quote,
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.100]   "What Do You Care What Other People Think?"
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.400]   is actually a quote, not of Feynman,
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.040]   but of his first wife, Arlene,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.800]   who sadly died at a very young age from tuberculosis.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.380]   Why am I sharing Feynman's story
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.160]   of loss of his first bride?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   Well, the reason is Feynman continued to write letters
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.940]   to Arlene for a long period of time.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.700]   This is well known only because after Feynman died,
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.560]   it was discovered that he kept an archive of letters
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.880]   to his deceased first wife.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.740]   And even though he did eventually marry and in fact,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.320]   had many relationships with many people,
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.680]   and I think was married twice more,
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.320]   maybe it was once, maybe it was twice,
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.360]   the intensity of his grief,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   but also his lack of ability to transition his mind
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.600]   to a place where he understood that Arlene had died
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.760]   is one of the more profound examples of this inability
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.240]   to reconcile the logical world and the emotional world.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.280]   And I'm now going to read to you a letter
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.920]   that Feynman wrote to Arlene.
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.900]   This was discovered after Feynman's death
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.000]   when they went through his desk and his belongings.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.160]   And as I read this,
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.940]   you're going to hear some of the typical narrative of grief
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.920]   that is not unique to Feynman and his dead wife.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.360]   But there are also some elements in there
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.700]   that I think you'll recognize as highlighting this disbelief
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.500]   and this dissociation between the reality
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.040]   of somebody's location in space and time
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.700]   and the emotional attachment that they hold for us.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.420]   And therein lies the information
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.540]   about how to better navigate grief.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.860]   So now I'm reading from the letter.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.740]   This was a letter dated October 17th, 1946.
[00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.860]   It's not terribly long, but bear with me.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.980]   "Dear Arlene, I adore you, sweetheart.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.600]   I know how much you like to hear that,
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.060]   but I don't only write it because you like it.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.460]   I write it because it makes me warm all over inside
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.200]   to write it to you.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.100]   It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you,
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.660]   almost two years, but I know you'll excuse me
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.860]   because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic,
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.900]   and I thought there was no sense to writing.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.240]   But now I know, my darling wife,
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.540]   that it is the right thing to do
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.900]   what I have delayed in doing
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.260]   and that I have done so much in the past.
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.040]   I wanted to tell you I love you.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.300]   I want to love you.
[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.000]   I will always love you."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.760]   So here we can hear the intense emotional attachment
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.260]   that clearly has persisted.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.940]   I find it hard to understand in my mind
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.500]   what it means to love you after you are dead,
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.940]   but I still want to comfort and take care of you,
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.740]   and I want you to love me and care for me.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.780]   I want to have problems to discuss with you.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.860]   I want to do little projects with you.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.680]   I never thought until just now that we can do that.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.380]   What should we do?
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.380]   We started to learn to make clothes together
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:22.560]   or learn Chinese or getting a movie projector.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.040]   Can't I do something now?
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.340]   No, I am alone without you,
[00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:29.400]   and you were the idea woman and the general instigator
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.080]   of all our wild adventures.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.380]   When you were sick, you worried
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.000]   because you could not give me something that you wanted,
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and you thought I needed.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.440]   You needn't have worried.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   Just as I told you then, there was no real need
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.940]   because I loved you in so many ways so much,
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.280]   and now it is clearly even more true.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.940]   You can give me nothing now,
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.960]   yet I love you so that you stand in the way
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.760]   of my loving anything else,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.320]   but I wanted you to stand there.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.800]   You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.740]   So you can really appreciate the depth
[00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.320]   and intensity of the attachment.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.660]   Despite two years time, it clearly has not waned.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.240]   I'll read the final paragraph now.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.520]   I know you will assure me that I am foolish
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.580]   and that you want me to have full happiness
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.520]   and don't want to be in my way.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.980]   I bet you are surprised that I don't even have a girlfriend,
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.660]   except you, sweetheart, after two years,
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.640]   but you can't help it, darling, nor can I.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.140]   I don't understand it, for I've met many girls
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.360]   and very nice ones, and I don't want to remain alone,
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.960]   but in two or three meetings, they all seem ashes.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.920]   You only are left to me.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.440]   You are real.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.560]   My darling wife, I do adore you.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.080]   I love my wife.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.760]   My wife is dead.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.320]   Rich.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.000]   P.S., please excuse my not mailing this,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.700]   but I don't know your new address.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.140]   So there's a lot contained in this letter.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.300]   We could parse it line by line,
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.240]   but I think it's fair to say
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.100]   that clearly there's an immense attachment
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.080]   that's been maintained.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.940]   So that's that dimension of closeness of attachment.
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.940]   Clearly there's an understanding that she's dead.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.660]   In fact, the last line of this love letter
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.660]   is my wife is dead, right?
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.500]   He now moves her into the third person, in fact,
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.700]   in that final line.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:17.880]   So he understands this, and yet he maintains the attachment.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.740]   And the very last portion of the letter,
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.980]   the P.S., the postscript,
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.740]   I don't know your new address, right?
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.920]   Somewhat humorous in the typical vein
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.020]   of a Feynman writing or speech.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.460]   He always had an intensely amusing
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.300]   and playful sense of humor.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.060]   And yet there's something really contained in this.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.680]   I don't think we're reading into this too much,
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.880]   in that he doesn't know where to find her.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.640]   He feels her as very real,
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.740]   and yet he doesn't know where to find her.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.480]   He doesn't know her address.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.840]   He obviously knows she's dead,
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.900]   so there's nowhere to mail it to.
[00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.380]   The reason I shared this letter with you,
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.280]   as opposed to one of the almost infinite number
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.280]   of other letters that have been written by poets
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.860]   and authors and scientists and everyday people,
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.100]   is that it really encapsulates all three dimensions
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.100]   of attachment and grief.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.320]   These notions of space, where is something or somebody?
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   Time, this dimension of how long would it take me
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.500]   to reach them or for them to reach me?
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:21.220]   What would it take in terms of time to be reunited?
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.980]   And then that last dimension of closeness.
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.880]   And the letter beautifully illustrates the fact
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.880]   that in grief, we maintain that sense of closeness,
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.460]   and yet we have to uncouple it
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.660]   from these other two dimensions,
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.780]   as we're referring to space and time.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.480]   So with this current understanding in mind,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.980]   a few things start to become obvious
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.060]   and entirely normal to us in the best
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:51.620]   and most healthy sense of the word normal.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.180]   For instance, if you've lost somebody or an animal,
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.820]   or even a thing that was vitally important to you,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.200]   it should make perfect sense to you
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.160]   as to why you keep looking for that person.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.580]   I recall this in my own life.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:08.100]   I had the unfortunate circumstance of my graduate advisor,
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:12.500]   who I was very close with, died quite young of breast cancer.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.660]   And her daughter, she has two daughters,
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.700]   kept her cell phone and would occasionally call me.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.880]   I had a quite close relationship to their family.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.260]   And when it would come in,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:28.060]   the number would pop up on my phone of not the daughter,
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.820]   but the name that showed up was of my graduate advisor.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.300]   So for years after she died,
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.380]   my initial impulse when the phone would ring was,
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.740]   "Oh my goodness, she's calling."
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.860]   It was a reflexive excitement
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.980]   because I truly always enjoyed hearing from her.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:45.000]   She's a wonderful, incredibly wonderful person,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.840]   I should say.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.780]   Similarly, when somebody passes away,
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.580]   we will find ourselves looking into a room,
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.180]   expecting to see them there,
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.540]   or expecting them to knock on the door any moment,
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.360]   or to call on Sunday morning, as it were.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:02.720]   Those expectations, those predictions
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.860]   that the brain is making are entirely normal
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:09.580]   because they are based on that deep catalog
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:12.680]   of episodic memory that you maintain about that person.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.300]   Again, the depth and richness of that catalog scaling,
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:19.400]   of course, in direct relation to how close you were
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.740]   with that person, right?
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.740]   Closer to somebody means more information about them.
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.600]   More information about them means your brain has a lot
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.820]   of implicit, unconscious notions of when and where
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.980]   and how they show up.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.500]   So the fact that your brain,
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:36.980]   and indeed sometimes your body,
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.780]   reacts to the expectation that they'll be there
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.820]   is entirely normal.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.700]   It's simply an activation of this map
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.140]   that involves closeness, space, and time.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:54.420]   Not surprisingly then, the reordering of that map
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.380]   that's required in order to move through
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:01.380]   the grieving process is going to involve some remapping.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.420]   And you, as the person grieving, have the opportunity to ask
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.960]   which node, as it's called, which element or dimension
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.400]   within that map are you going to focus on?
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.540]   Some people really try hard to disengage with
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.600]   and remap their sense of emotional closeness to the person.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.500]   That is, it's so unbelievably overwhelming to them
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.620]   that the person is no longer accessible,
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.480]   that they try and change their ideas
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.300]   about how close they really were.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.220]   They try and change their emotional attachment
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.060]   to the person after they've died.
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.980]   Clearly in the example that I gave in the Feynman letter,
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.920]   that's not the case.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.860]   The attachment seems indeed quite fixed
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:43.020]   and not going anywhere.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.500]   Psychologists and neuroscientists generally agree
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.440]   that the best way to approach moving through grief
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.740]   is actually to remap these dimensions
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.780]   while maintaining the close sense of attachment
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.240]   to the person by not in any way trying to undermine
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.900]   the intensity of the attachment or how important it was
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.200]   to you.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.380]   So we'll now talk about how that process works
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:11.180]   and the different entry points, as they're called,
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.260]   to engaging in that process.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.020]   So one straightforward way to think about this state
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.780]   of mind and body that we call grief
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   is that the idea that someone or an animal or a thing
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:27.100]   simply does not exist anymore is not something
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.900]   that the brain can easily conceptualize.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.900]   And the reason for that is that we as beings
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.280]   that have a brain and a brain as an organ
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.480]   that makes predictions tends to rely more on experience
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.820]   than knowledge.
[00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.440]   In other words, the knowledge that someone or an animal
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.980]   or a thing is gone, that it doesn't exist,
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.960]   at least not in the dimensionality
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:55.920]   that we were accustomed to relating to them in,
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.500]   is something that we can understand logically,
[00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.520]   but that emotionally is very hard to undo
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.880]   and from a memory perspective is very hard to undo.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.420]   So it's not just that we are in a state
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.500]   of emotional disbelief.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.620]   It's that we have neurons, literally nerve cells
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.780]   and neural circuits, connections between nerve cells
[00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.380]   that are dedicated to this vast implicit knowledge
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.540]   of all the things we know about that person,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.020]   animal or thing.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.340]   And just because they are no longer in the dimensionality,
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.980]   meaning in the configuration alive or present in our life
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.280]   that they were before, doesn't eliminate those memories.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.500]   Those memories persist.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.020]   And so anytime we call to mind the person's name
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.580]   or we call to mind things that remind us of them,
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.860]   or we suddenly feel the desire to engage with them,
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.800]   the memories, those episodic implicit memories,
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.680]   as they're called, all that menu and library of knowledge
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.120]   slams us straight in the face and pushes us into a mode
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:04.960]   of wanting to act in a way that's consistent
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.400]   with them still being here in the way
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.680]   that all that knowledge told us they were
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.240]   when we acquired it.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.420]   That's a very long-winded way of saying
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.160]   that there's nothing wrong about the emotional state
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.660]   when we are in a state of grief.
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.260]   In fact, quite the opposite.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.580]   But there is something wrong about the memories
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.180]   because the memories are based on our prior knowledge
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.960]   of them and those memories actually do not apply
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.260]   to our current knowledge of them.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.060]   And again, even though our brain is a prediction machine
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.540]   and it's a very good one, it's not perfect.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.240]   In fact, it's far from perfect.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.140]   So really moving through grief is a process
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:45.900]   of understanding how relationships are mapped in the brain,
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.220]   space, time, and closeness, also called attachment,
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.660]   understanding those three dimensions,
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.840]   understanding that they are closely linked,
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.420]   and then understanding that simply the knowledge
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:57.280]   that somebody or something or an animal
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:02.240]   isn't accessible to us does not allow us to discard
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.640]   of all the knowledge that we have.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.720]   And as a consequence, our brain is constantly
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.800]   generating expectations of how to access them,
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.740]   even if we know that's completely irrational.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:17.180]   Now, this should, I would hope,
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.400]   assist you in moving through grief.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.620]   It's not a tool of the sort of like a switch
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.880]   that you can flip and suddenly not feel grief,
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.580]   but it does point to a specific set of mechanisms
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.620]   or a specific set of steps that you can engage
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:33.760]   in order to start to move through the grieving process
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.500]   in the most adaptive and effective way
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.380]   and in a way that still holds in mind
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.380]   your close attachment to the person.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.680]   So let's talk about some of the tools
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.820]   for adaptively moving through grief.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.160]   These are tools gleaned from the research psychology,
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.320]   the clinical psychology, and the neuroscience literature.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.400]   So I've synthesized my understanding
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.740]   of those three literatures to provide the tools
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.100]   that I'm about to describe.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.620]   The first one involves the acknowledgement
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.760]   and really the understanding that you don't want
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.020]   to disengage or dismantle your real attachment
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:10.000]   to someone, an animal, or a thing.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.880]   That's a real thing, and there is actually
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.840]   no adaptive reason to try and persuade yourself
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.820]   or numb yourself or somehow avoid the thinking
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.420]   of just how much they meant to you.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.720]   What is important, however, is that you make some effort
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.800]   to shift your mindset and your understanding of that person
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.740]   in a way that holds in mind that yes, indeed,
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.920]   the attachment is very real,
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.640]   and in some cases is very, very intense,
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:40.360]   but is now going to be uncoupled
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.640]   from the other two dimensions of the map,
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.520]   namely space and time.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:47.420]   So again, just to make absolutely clear,
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:49.920]   there's no reason to try and convince yourself
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.980]   that you weren't actually that close to this person
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.000]   or them to you.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.320]   There's no reason to try and reduce the intensity
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.240]   of that attachment to the contrary.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.860]   You want to anchor yourself to that attachment,
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.340]   but you want to make sure that your thoughts
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.560]   about the person and your feelings about the person
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.860]   are not oriented toward, or in reference to, I should say,
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.940]   that map, that deep catalog of memories that you had.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.640]   Now, this is not simply a fancy way of saying
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.020]   don't live in the past.
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:24.340]   This is saying you need to maintain your sense of attachment,
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:28.100]   but you need to start making predictions and understanding
[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.180]   about how you're going to engage with that attachment,
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.700]   how you're going to feel those things
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.520]   without the expectation that things that once happened before
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.140]   are going to happen again.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:41.980]   So it's a complicated process you can imagine,
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.740]   but you really want to hold and register two things at once.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.460]   It's sort of like spinning two plates at once,
[00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:49.440]   and therefore it's going to feel like effort.
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:52.460]   One way to do this is to set aside a dedicated period
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.140]   of time of maybe five or 10,
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.380]   maybe even as much as 30 minutes,
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.460]   or depending on your capacity, 30 to 45 minutes,
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.420]   in which you are going to feel deeply into your closeness
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.600]   and your attachment to that person, animal, or thing.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.820]   But you're consciously going to try and prevent yourself
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:16.700]   from thinking about a couple of categories of things.
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.820]   First of all, you want to actively try and disengage
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.640]   from any attempt to engage in what's called
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.500]   counterfactual thinking, the what ifs.
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.840]   What if I had called them a day earlier?
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.880]   What if they had taken a different route home?
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.020]   What if I had taken a different route home?
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.560]   These counterfactual modes of thinking
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.240]   are an infinite landscape of possibility,
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.860]   and they are very closely tied to guilt.
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.200]   Guilt is an interesting emotion.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.120]   We should probably do an entire episode about guilt,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.660]   but guilt, as defined by psychologists and neuroscientists,
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.700]   is actually a way of assigning ourselves more agency,
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.840]   more capability of controlling reality than actually exists.
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.580]   And it's a very slippery slope, and I want to be clear,
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.340]   it's not the case that guilt is never an appropriate
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.620]   response, but in the context of grieving,
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.460]   guilt is very precarious because in thinking
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:15.280]   I could have done this, or if I had only done that,
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.620]   you are essentially exploring an infinite landscape
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.300]   of things that you can never refute.
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.420]   You will never know that had you not gone down
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.660]   a different path, or they had not taken a particular path
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.700]   in life that things would have turned out different,
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:35.100]   but you can't know that it would have worked as well.
[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.740]   Meaning you actually don't know that your what ifs are true,
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.020]   and you don't know that they're not true.
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.980]   And so as an infinite space, it's a very precarious one,
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.060]   and it will not allow you to uncouple
[00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.240]   that intense emotional attachment that I'm telling you
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.700]   is actually vital to hold onto from that catalog
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.820]   of episodic memory that you've established.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.920]   In fact, it's going to strengthen those bonds.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.760]   So in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.860]   whatever period of time you can tolerate
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.800]   and maintain focus.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.940]   The idea is to think about your attachment in a rich way
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.160]   and to perhaps even experience that in your brain and body.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.860]   I think if you're in a stage of grief,
[00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:16.180]   that actually will be fairly reflexive to do,
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.680]   but to try as much as possible to hold that grief
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.700]   in the present and to be connected
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:23.960]   to your immediate physical environment.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.460]   So you want to orient yourself in current space and time
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.500]   rather than focus on memories or what you would have liked
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.660]   to see happen or the wish that they were still there
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.260]   while at the same time, thinking about the depth
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.420]   and richness of that attachment.
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.180]   This is obviously a tight rope walk, so to speak.
[00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:44.740]   It's an emotionally challenging,
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.500]   and sometimes even will be experienced
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:50.580]   as a physically challenging tool or experience.
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:53.860]   But in our understanding of how attachments
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:55.780]   and grief are represented in the brain,
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.420]   this can be an immensely beneficial practice
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.360]   because it is the first step.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   And indeed it represents many of the steps
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.480]   in the voyage from the initial shock of loss
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.960]   to our ability to hold in mind somebody or an animal
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:14.080]   or a thing in a way that still allows us to feel the depth
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:15.860]   and fullness of connection to them
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:17.280]   without feeling the yearning,
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:19.440]   that reaching for the glass of water
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.120]   that unfortunately will never be resolved.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:25.080]   Keep in mind that as you embark on this process,
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.880]   it is entirely normal for your mind
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.240]   to flip into various states of expectation
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.280]   that they're suddenly going to be there.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.480]   In fact, because of the closeness
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:35.340]   of these three dimensions in the map,
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.980]   space, time, and attachment,
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   it's entirely normal that when you start to think
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.640]   about your attachment to somebody or an animal or a thing,
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.880]   that you almost start to experience them
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:48.980]   as present in that environment.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.920]   I'll share with you a somewhat bizarre,
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.060]   or it sounds bizarre to articulate out loud,
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.960]   but many of you perhaps will resonate with this.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.880]   For years after my graduate advisor died,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.440]   I would get an experience of someone touching
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.360]   the back of my neck when I would think about her.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.640]   And that was not an experience I ever had with her, right?
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.920]   It was a professional relationship.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.760]   I don't ever recall her touching the back of my neck
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.360]   or me touching the back of my neck in her presence,
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:15.760]   at least not on a regular basis.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.800]   So it was very perplexing to me.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.160]   And then I encountered this incredible literature on grief,
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.420]   which said the following, "Grief in many ways
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.880]   is like a phantom limb."
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.860]   For those of you that aren't familiar,
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.920]   many people who experience amputation of a limb,
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:35.160]   either through surgery or accident or otherwise,
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.940]   will feel in a very genuine way
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.280]   that the limb is still present,
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.140]   even though when they look for the limb, it's not there.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.680]   So they can feel pain in limbs,
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.140]   they can feel the sensation of touch.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.460]   There's some famous experiments from the neurologist
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.400]   and my former colleague at University of California,
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   San Diego, who goes by his last name, Ramachandran.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.680]   Some people just call him Rama.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.400]   He's an incredible scientist
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.960]   and has done a lot of really important work,
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.760]   in particular on phantom limb, among other things.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.720]   And has done some beautiful experiments
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:07.120]   showing that people who have phantom limb pain
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.000]   or that are experiencing different sensations
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.800]   in their phantom limb, that can be very intrusive,
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:15.120]   much in the same way that expecting someone
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:18.820]   to walk through the door who you happen to know is deceased
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.480]   can be very intrusive.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.720]   Ramachandran has done beautiful experiments
[00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:25.420]   showing that if you give people what's called a mirror box,
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:29.280]   this is a box in which you insert an intact limb
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.200]   and there are some mirrors
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.100]   that give you the visual impression
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.720]   that the other limb is still present
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.280]   and you move the intact limb
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.760]   and you get a mirror image of the non-existent,
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.320]   but nonetheless, visual image of the phantom limb moving,
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.400]   that you can resolve some of the pain of a limb
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.000]   that feels otherwise cramped up.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.120]   In other words, the visual perception
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.420]   can reverse some of these phantom sensations.
[00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:54.460]   In many ways, the phantom limb scenario
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:56.940]   and what I described about a sensation
[00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.420]   of being touched on the back of the neck
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.840]   or this feeling that we have
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.960]   when we engage in the thinking and the emotions
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.140]   of our attachment to someone, an animal or a thing,
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.540]   is very much like a phantom limb,
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.060]   only it exists in the emotional space.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.580]   And it exists because it is reactivation
[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:18.160]   of these maps about space, time, and person.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.420]   And so if the process of moving through grief adaptively
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:24.240]   in a healthy way involves maintaining the attachment,
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.600]   but uncoupling that attachment
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.560]   from the space and time representation
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.020]   of that person, animal, or thing that we had before,
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.800]   well, then the question becomes,
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.040]   where should we place our expectation of them, right?
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.280]   Now, that of course will vary from person to person.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.360]   Some people with particular religious beliefs
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.820]   will indeed believe that the soul of the person,
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.860]   the molecules of the person have been reordered
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.100]   and exist in some sort of either distributed domain, right?
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.140]   That they are in everything or they are in one location.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:58.240]   I'm not here to speak to that one way or the other.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.940]   There's no good experiment I know
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.820]   either to prove or disprove that, nor would I want to.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.700]   It's not the job of science, frankly.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:11.540]   However, allowing ourselves to place notions
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.100]   of where that person, animal, or thing is
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.980]   in their current new configuration, whatever that might be,
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.500]   ashes, dashes, dust to dust,
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.420]   or that the person's soul comes out of their body.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.260]   These are all the different variations that people hear.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.380]   Or some people think, well, it's just molecules
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.860]   and they disintegrate and are reordered
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.700]   and come up as the plants and the trees.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:34.300]   Again, a near infinite number of possibilities,
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.740]   and it depends a lot on personal belief.
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.380]   It is however essential that no matter what you believe,
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.580]   that you have some firm representation
[01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.020]   of where that person, animal, or thing is
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.060]   so that you can plug it into this map,
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:56.060]   this three-dimensional map of space, time, and attachment.
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.520]   The process of moving through grief can't simply be
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.860]   that we hold onto the attachment and we discard
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.420]   with any understanding of where they are in space and time.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.780]   And actually the letter that Feynman wrote
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.460]   to his deceased wife, Arlene,
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:12.140]   again, so beautifully and really poignantly
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.060]   illustrates the fact that he doesn't really know
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.260]   where to find her.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.900]   On the one hand, he really understands that she's gone.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.460]   And on the other hand, he understands
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.760]   that he still very much expects her to be there,
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.960]   that he would like to mail the letter.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.520]   But then of course, in this final somewhat humorous line,
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.300]   he doesn't know where to send the letter, he tells us.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.420]   What's very clear and I think is very healthy is the fact
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.860]   that the emotional bond is still there,
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.420]   that that is maintained.
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.100]   And so this tool, if you will,
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:47.220]   of dedicated blocks of time for really spending some effort,
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.220]   and it is indeed effort to access the emotional connection
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:53.420]   while starting to uncouple the other nodes of the map,
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   as it were, is something that is hard.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.440]   You should expect it to be hard,
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.700]   but in terms of the options one has
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:02.580]   in order to deal with grief,
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.160]   it is indeed the most adaptive way to go about it.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.540]   You're not trying to avoid thinking about it.
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.260]   You're not engaging in this counterfactual thinking,
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.200]   the what if, what if, what if.
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:17.920]   You're not drowning it out with substances or delusion
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.160]   or with other ways of distracting yourself.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.260]   So in that sense, it is truly adaptive.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.760]   Now, of course, I don't want to imply
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.900]   that I'm a clinical psychologist, I'm certainly not.
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.340]   There is absolutely a place
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:31.060]   for working with a trained professional
[01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:34.280]   to move through grief, especially these situations,
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.060]   these one in 10 people who deal
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.880]   with what's called complicated grief or very prolonged grief.
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.940]   Those are somewhat different things,
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:43.500]   but in general point to the fact
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.860]   that there are people who have
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.920]   an exceptionally hard time moving through grief.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.860]   We'll talk about who those people are
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.040]   and ways to move through them
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.980]   with or without a professional to assist you.
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.760]   But nonetheless, we're starting to understand
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.420]   on the basis of neuroscience,
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.380]   what some of the more adaptive and functional ways
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.900]   of moving through grief are.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.980]   In order to really understand how a tool of the sort
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.440]   that we're describing ought to work
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.800]   and what it's designed to accomplish at a mechanistic level,
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.980]   I'd like to teach you about a very important aspect
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.960]   of your brain function that has everything to do with grief
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:22.060]   and the process of moving through grief,
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.700]   but has a lot to do with other aspects
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.940]   of our life experience as well.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:28.060]   Some of you are probably familiar
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.100]   with a brain area called the hippocampus.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.300]   The hippocampus is a structure that's involved
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.860]   in the formation of new memories,
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.100]   but not the maintenance of memories.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.940]   I discussed the hippocampus in detail
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.600]   in our episode on memory and our episode with our guest,
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.660]   Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.320]   an expert on learning and memory.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.460]   During those two discussions,
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.560]   I did not however touch into what the different cell types
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.640]   are in the hippocampus and the different roles they perform.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.140]   And it turns out that there are indeed different cell types
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.640]   in the hippocampus and they performed very different roles
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.780]   that are absolutely central to the grief process.
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:07.760]   We have cells in our hippocampus,
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.600]   meaning you have cells in your hippocampus.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:15.020]   These cells are neurons, nerve cells that fire anytime,
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.440]   and when we say fire, I should just remind you,
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.940]   I mean have electrical activity,
[01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:25.580]   anytime that we enter a particular familiar location.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:28.340]   So for instance, think about your bedroom
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.960]   and think about where the bed is, as you're doing that,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.600]   these so-called place cells are firing,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.240]   not necessarily to represent that it's a bed
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.180]   at that location, but to represent the location itself.
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.600]   We also have neurons in our hippocampus
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.680]   and elsewhere in our brain, I should say,
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.380]   that represent proximity.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.660]   So for instance, if you were to wake up
[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.760]   in the middle of the night and walk into the kitchen
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.900]   and it's somewhat dark and you orient toward the sink
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.600]   to get yourself a glass of water or to the refrigerator
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.960]   to get yourself something to drink or to eat,
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.120]   as you get close to the sink or the refrigerator,
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.680]   there are neurons in your hippocampus
[01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.760]   that are going to start engaging electrical activity
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.080]   because you are in the mere expected proximity
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.920]   of the sink or refrigerator and you know where they are,
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.940]   hence the word expected.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.440]   Now that all seems fine and good,
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.020]   you've got neurons that represent where things are
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.160]   and sort of goes without saying that those same neurons
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.520]   map to our emotional attachments.
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.840]   We generally know where to find our loved ones,
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.520]   even if they don't live with us,
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.800]   we generally know what city they're in.
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.720]   Even if they're traveling,
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.120]   we generally have a sense of where they're traveling
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.900]   or the general area in which they're traveling.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.920]   Place cells and proximity cells are involved
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.960]   in that kind of mapping and representations as well.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.160]   Now there's a third kind of cell
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.960]   that's particularly important for the sort of tool
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.420]   that we were talking about earlier,
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.160]   that tool of holding onto the emotional attachment
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.600]   to somebody and yet trying to deliberately remap
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.040]   our understanding of where they are in space and time.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.660]   And that has to do with a category of cells
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.640]   called trace cells.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.440]   Trace cells were discovered by a number of laboratories.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.020]   I think the most renowned of those is the Moser Laboratory.
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.840]   The Mosers are a couple,
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.240]   actually they were a couple, they're now,
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.920]   I think amicably separated or divorced.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.280]   That's not what this episode's about.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.920]   If I have that wrong, forgive me.
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.960]   Edvard and Brittain are their names.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.420]   Their relationship isn't what's important,
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   except what is important is the work that they did together
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.320]   in one form or another,
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.080]   which was very important work establishing
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.700]   this category of cells in the, not just in the hippocampus,
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   but in an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.080]   that act as a sort of coordinate system
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.940]   to orient us in space and time.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:50.860]   Trace cells are activated when we expect something
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.460]   to be at a given location, but it's not there.
[01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.700]   Experiments done in their laboratory
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:00.460]   and in other laboratories have shown that, for instance,
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.840]   if you give a rodent or frankly a person,
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.140]   a object that always resides at the same location
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:12.700]   and we reach to it in order to access it,
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.360]   let's say where your coffee maker is in the morning.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:18.420]   I do a pour over coffee.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.240]   If I'm drinking coffee or mate, I'll do a pour over.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.980]   It's always more or less in the same location.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.920]   And so there are place cells and proximity cells
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.460]   that relate to my being able to find
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.320]   that pour over coffee cone thing.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.760]   However, if I were to go to that location
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.560]   and it wasn't there, the trace cells,
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.300]   these neurons in my hippocampus
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.400]   and an entorhinal cortex and elsewhere,
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.680]   'cause again, these cells are connected by way of circuitry,
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.180]   by way of connections, those trace cells would fire.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.940]   We could even call it a trace circuit.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:52.580]   It's a circuit that has an expectation
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:53.920]   that something will be in a location,
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.620]   but when something is not at that location,
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.320]   this circuit becomes active.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.260]   This is important because what we're talking about here
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.920]   is a neural circuit and a set of neurons
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.260]   that are responsible not for the presence of something,
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.360]   but the absence of something.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:10.100]   We have every reason to believe
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.340]   based on neuroimaging studies and studies in animal models
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.580]   that trace cells become very active in the immediate stage
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.380]   after the loss of a loved one,
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:25.900]   that the brain and our maps of the person, place, or thing
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:29.220]   that we know cognitively, we understand,
[01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.840]   we even believe they are gone.
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.940]   They are not accessible for whatever reason,
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.580]   death or otherwise.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.900]   And yet we have neurons that are firing
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:41.420]   to reveal that absence to us.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:46.140]   And these neurons are closely associated with neurons
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.940]   that tell us where things ought to be.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.380]   So if you feel the expectation
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.940]   or you sense that somebody should walk through the door
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.780]   any moment or call at any moment
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.620]   or be next to you when you wake up,
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.900]   and yet you cognitively understand that they won't,
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.540]   that there's no real reason why they should
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:06.180]   because they are indeed gone, you are not crazy.
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:11.180]   In fact, it's simply a reflection of the normal functioning
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.780]   of these trace cells and trace circuits.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.060]   Now I'd like to consider why two people,
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:21.060]   both who are intensely attached to a person
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.060]   that is no longer there, can experience the grief
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:27.940]   of the loss of that person in such different ways.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.260]   This is often observed.
[01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:33.600]   You can have, God forbid, incredibly sadly,
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.520]   in cases where a child is lost,
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.760]   where both parents are grieving intensely,
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.400]   but one seems to feel it at a emotional depth and level
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.040]   that seems distinct from the other.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.260]   Now, of course, keep in mind
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.540]   that we never really know how other people are feeling.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.600]   This is something actually that was raised in the episode
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.700]   where I interviewed a psychiatrist
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.740]   and researcher colleague of mine from Stanford,
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:57.820]   Carl Deisseroth.
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:02.440]   As a psychiatrist, I heard him say once
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.820]   that we really don't know how other people feel.
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.600]   In fact, a lot of the times we don't even really know
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.300]   how we feel, or at least describing that
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.880]   is quite challenging with language often.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.020]   And indeed that is the case.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.360]   We don't really know how other people feel.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.440]   There's no clear way of knowing
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.920]   that the expression someone else has
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.420]   or whether or not they're crying or not,
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.700]   or their body language really represents
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.740]   how they feel inside.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.120]   So that is important to keep in mind.
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.560]   Nonetheless, there does seem to be
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.740]   a sort of a split among people,
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:37.100]   and indeed among animals as well, even within a species,
[01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.360]   in terms of how intensely they feel
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.680]   the yearning aspect of grief.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.400]   And it appears based on a number of different lines
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.960]   of evidence that that relates to this molecule
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.760]   that some of you have probably heard of, which is oxytocin.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.200]   Oxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.160]   A peptide just means a protein, generally a small protein.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.320]   And a hormone is generally something that functions
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:02.860]   at numerous locations in the body
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.740]   to impact numerous organs and areas of the brain.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.700]   So a peptide can be a hormone and a hormone can be a peptide.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.260]   They are not mutually exclusive.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:13.740]   Oxytocin has a variety of roles in the brain and body.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.600]   It's involved in milk letdown during lactation.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.820]   It's involved in pair bonding, both in males and females.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.300]   It's involved in bonding of parent to child
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   and indeed between romantic partners, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.100]   Let's talk about some of the animal models that inform us
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.900]   about the potential roles of oxytocin
[01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.200]   in the grieving process.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.180]   There's a species of animal called the prairie vole.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.820]   And believe it or not, the prairie vole
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.980]   has been studied fairly extensively
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.140]   by neuroscience and psychology researchers.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.840]   In fact, our former director
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.220]   of the National Institutes of Mental Health, Tom Insel,
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:52.780]   his laboratory focused quite heavily on prairie voles.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.620]   Prairie voles are one species of animal,
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.820]   but depending on where they live,
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.900]   you find that some prairie voles are monogamous.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.900]   That is, they mate with the same prairie vole for life.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.140]   They raise litters of little prairie voles for life.
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.600]   And other prairie voles generally
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.420]   that live in different locations in the wild
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.780]   are non-monogamous, sometimes called polygamous.
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:22.020]   The neurochemical and circuit basis
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:25.980]   for this monogamy versus non-monogamy are quite interesting.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:29.780]   However, in the context of grief and attachment,
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.820]   the prairie voles have taught us a lot.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.560]   And they've taught us a lot through the following experiment.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.100]   Take two prairie voles that are coupled up.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.560]   So these would be monogamous prairie voles
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.140]   that have established a couple-dom.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.860]   I guess you would call that a prairie voledom, anyway.
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.900]   Put them in a cage together, they mate together,
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:53.040]   they raise young together, and then you separate them.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.480]   You literally put a physical barrier
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.580]   between the two of them, and you can evaluate
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.140]   how strongly one prairie vole will work
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.920]   to get access to the other prairie vole, right?
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.760]   This is sort of the Romeo and Juliet
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.340]   of prairie vole experiments.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:13.840]   And what you observe is that the monogamous prairie voles
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.440]   will work very hard to get back to their mate,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.560]   to get access to their mate.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.800]   They will lever press.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.640]   They'll even walk across a metal plate
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.760]   that they get an electrical shock.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.440]   They will work very, very hard.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.100]   They will cross rivers and valleys, if you will,
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.020]   in the experimental context, that is.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.400]   The polygamous prairie voles, and again,
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.320]   we don't know if they're polyamorous.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.040]   We don't know what they feel, right?
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   We don't know if they're in love
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.900]   or if they're motivated simply for other things,
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.740]   but the non-monogamous prairie voles
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:51.740]   will not work as hard to access a prairie vole partner.
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.940]   Now, you could argue that's because they expect
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.500]   that there will be other prairie vole partners,
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.720]   but even if they've never experienced
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.180]   another prairie vole partner,
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.080]   they won't work quite as hard to get back
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.800]   in connection with this other prairie vole,
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.800]   to mate or otherwise.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.640]   This turns out to be interesting
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.920]   when you start to explore the patterns
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.720]   of so-called oxytocin receptors in the brain.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.960]   To make a long story short,
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.200]   and to also bridge to the human literature,
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.120]   it turns out that the monogamous prairie voles
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.560]   have far more oxytocin receptors in this brain area
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.300]   that I mentioned earlier, the nucleus accumbens.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.340]   And again, to remind you,
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.980]   the nucleus accumbens is the brain area
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.660]   associated with motivation, craving, and pursuit.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.020]   So it's as if the monogamous prairie voles
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:44.020]   have a capacity to link the attachment circuitry
[01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.460]   and the molecules of attachment, in this case, oxytocin,
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.820]   to reward pathways and to motivational pathways.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.000]   Polygamous, or we should say non-monogamous prairie voles,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.940]   do as well.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.740]   However, they have less oxytocin receptors.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.300]   So in other words, non-monogamous prairie voles
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.620]   seem to have less yearning for attachment overall,
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.620]   at least to a single individual prairie vole.
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.740]   And when we look at the human literature
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.380]   in terms of oxytocin receptor expression
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.380]   and brain imaging experiments and so on,
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.320]   what you find is the same.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.980]   The people that experience intense grief
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:24.100]   and a deep yearning and a motivation
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:28.760]   to reconnect with the person, animal, or thing that is lost,
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.320]   in many cases have heightened levels of oxytocin,
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.480]   specifically, or I should say oxytocin receptors
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.660]   to be exact, specifically within the brain regions
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:41.520]   associated with craving and pursuit.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.140]   So for those of you that find yourself
[01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.700]   in this kind of stuck mode,
[01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.620]   this persistence of trying to reach into the past
[01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:53.900]   or wishful thinking, this counterfactual thinking,
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.640]   if only, if only, if only,
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.220]   you don't necessarily want to pathologize that thinking.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.100]   First of all, we should acknowledge
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.780]   that it's not necessarily adaptive.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.020]   And in fact, in the complete loss of somebody,
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.940]   or if somebody says they don't want anything to do with you
[01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:10.700]   ever again, by all means, if that's expressed clearly,
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.600]   then you need to accept that reality.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.140]   But the yearning, the desire and the impulsivity,
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:21.660]   the kind of leaning in and at a almost reflexive way
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.240]   to try and access that person again,
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.940]   to text them, to want to hear from them could,
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.940]   and I have to highlight, could reflect the fact that
[01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.420]   you just so happen to have more oxytocin receptors
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.260]   or maybe more oxytocin overall in this brain area
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.360]   that's associated with motivation and pursuit.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.900]   It does not necessarily mean that you are more capable
[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.000]   of attachment than people who move through grief
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.900]   more quickly.
[01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.880]   And I should say that people move through grief
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.540]   at different rates, even if two people lost the same person
[01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.800]   or same animal, people move through this at different rates.
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.880]   And some of that is no doubt psychological,
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.400]   but some of it no doubt is also neurochemical
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.640]   and biological.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.860]   And in sharing this with you,
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.080]   I hope it sheds some understanding
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.580]   and perhaps even some compassion for people
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.460]   who are moving through things more quickly
[01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:12.040]   or in a different way.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:15.120]   And of course it should also, I would hope,
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.100]   shed compassion and understanding for people that seem
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.400]   incapable of "moving on."
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.100]   It's taking them far longer to move on.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.360]   Earlier, we talked about complicated grief,
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.340]   non-complicated grief, and prolonged grief disorder.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.660]   And I should say that the precise divisions
[01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:36.220]   between these categories is not very precise.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.080]   It takes a really trained expert to be able to identify
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.480]   whether or not somebody is in the prolonged grief disorder
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.100]   category, complicated or non-complicated grief.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.000]   There's actually a set of questionnaires that I invite you
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.640]   to answer if you like.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.420]   They were provided, or I should say,
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.080]   I accessed them through a public site
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.720]   on Mary Frances O'Connor's webpage.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.500]   We'll put them in the show note captions.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.920]   You actually can submit those answers in an anonymous way
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.780]   to a study that she's doing.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.600]   She has several surveys,
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.360]   one for loss of a romantic relationship,
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.240]   other for loss due to death of somebody,
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:13.800]   and still another one that relates to homesickness.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.960]   And it's also available in several different languages.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.240]   So I provide a link to that website.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.200]   It's very easy to download.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.680]   There's no cost to that at all.
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:23.680]   You can contribute to the scientific data collection process
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.520]   if you like.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.760]   And I do believe that you get your scores back
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.080]   or an interpretation of your scores by participating there.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:34.360]   When Mary Frances O'Connor hopefully comes on the podcast,
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:36.000]   she can tell us some more of the detail
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.880]   about separating out this prolonged grief disorder,
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.780]   complicated and non-complicated grief.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.560]   But in the meantime,
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.120]   it's very clear that people move through grief
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.380]   at different rates.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.200]   And as I mentioned just a moment ago,
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.720]   that this is entirely normal,
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.360]   probably has a basis in neurochemicals
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.920]   and hormones such as oxytocin.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.200]   There are probably other reasons as well.
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.760]   In fact, we can assume with almost certainty
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.160]   that there are other reasons as well.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.800]   Nonetheless, I think it is really important to think about
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.720]   why some people might have a harder time
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.880]   moving through grief due to life circumstance,
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.700]   innate differences, and so on.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.320]   There's a very nice set of studies,
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.240]   but one in particular entitled
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.960]   "Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated Grief Outcomes."
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.840]   Here again, the first author is Mary Frances O'Connor
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.720]   reminding us that she's done so much important work
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.540]   in this area.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:29.960]   This paper has several conclusions,
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.000]   but one of the key conclusions
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.800]   is that this particular category of molecules
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.960]   we call the catecholamines.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.320]   The catecholamines include epinephrine,
[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.360]   which is also adrenaline, norepinephrine,
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.760]   which is noradrenaline, and dopamine,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.520]   which you've learned about before.
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:46.260]   Here I'm just going to paraphrase,
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.240]   or I'll read directly actually,
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:50.440]   what they found was that participants,
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.840]   again, this is human subjects,
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.760]   with the highest levels of epinephrine, of adrenaline,
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.280]   pretreatment had the highest levels
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.040]   of complicated grief symptoms post-treatment,
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.440]   and that could account for their baseline level of symptoms.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.120]   What this means is that people
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:05.880]   that have a lot of circulating adrenaline,
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.160]   we might even call these people who are,
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.080]   or typically reside at a higher level of autonomic arousal,
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.460]   right, we have an autonomic nervous system
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:17.620]   that dictates how calm or alert or stressed
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.260]   we happen to be just at baseline.
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:22.300]   People who tend to be more alert and anxious at baseline
[01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:25.780]   prior to any grief episode tend to have,
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.280]   or statistically on average, we should say,
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.680]   are more likely to experience complicated grief
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.040]   and maybe even prolonged grief symptoms.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.740]   So if you're somebody that is anticipating losing someone
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.320]   or an animal or a thing at some point,
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.880]   and I think that really means everybody,
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.960]   utilizing tools to adjust your epinephrine,
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.940]   your adrenaline levels down
[01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:49.480]   has a number of important benefits,
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.040]   improving sleep, health metrics, et cetera.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.200]   There are tools to do that.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.140]   We have an episode on mastering stress
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:58.240]   that you can find at our website, humorinlab.com.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:01.160]   It has a lot of behavioral tools that are backed by science,
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.920]   some of work that was done in my laboratory,
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.620]   but certainly other laboratories as well
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:09.780]   that will allow you to control your autonomic nervous system
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.720]   both in real time and reduce the overall level of stress
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.960]   and even chronic activation
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.220]   of the so-called sympathetic arm
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.280]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.500]   which is just fancy geek speak for saying,
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.540]   there are tools to help you be calm,
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.840]   not just for sake of navigating daily stress,
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.360]   but as this paper illustrates,
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.120]   for anticipating the fact that at some point
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.880]   you will lose somebody, an animal or a thing.
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:35.960]   And there is a way to move through that process
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.840]   that we call healthy, normal grieving.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.840]   And then there's the so-called complicated grief
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.900]   or prolonged grief disorders
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.760]   that reflect immense challenge in moving through grief
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.420]   at a reasonable rate.
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:51.040]   So you can somewhat inoculate yourself
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.280]   against complicated or prolonged grief
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.240]   by reducing your resting levels of,
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.400]   or your pre-loss levels of epinephrine, of adrenaline.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.320]   And again, there are excellent tools to do that.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.880]   I won't review them here for sake of time,
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.840]   but they're timestamped and you can access those easily.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.060]   Again, zero cost tools.
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.000]   Going back to this paper,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.440]   catecholamine predictors of complicated grief
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.520]   treatment outcomes should say that not only did participants
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.900]   with the highest levels of adrenaline
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.280]   have the highest levels of complicated grief symptoms
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.400]   post-treatment,
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.320]   but the predictive relationship between these two things,
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.980]   adrenaline and complicated grief,
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:30.560]   was not seen in depression.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.400]   And I find that incredibly interesting
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.560]   because it further separates depression from grieving
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.380]   and grieving from depression.
[01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.160]   A resounding theme again and again,
[01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.360]   grieving is not depression
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.480]   and depression is not necessarily grieving.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.920]   They can coexist, but they are separable as well
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.240]   and indeed reflect separate brain circuitries entirely.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.080]   So the conclusion they draw is that the present study
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.280]   supports the hypothesis that catecholamine levels,
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.480]   again, epinephrine, dopamine, norepinephrine,
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.800]   are the catecholamines, are affected by bereavement
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.200]   and in turn can affect the ability of those
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.880]   with complicated grief to benefit from psychotherapy.
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.720]   So what does all this mean?
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.040]   What this means is we can prepare ourselves
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.320]   to be in a better state to access,
[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.060]   yes, access grief when it's appropriate.
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:17.080]   And indeed grief is the appropriate response
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.480]   when we lose someone, an animal or a thing
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.200]   that we are closely attached to.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:25.640]   And yet to be able to move through that at a pace
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.280]   and in a way that is most adaptive for us.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.660]   And to just, again, highlight what adaptive means,
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:34.400]   it does not mean dissociating from the attachment
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.000]   to the person, animal or thing.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.480]   I just want to pause for a second
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.480]   and mention why I keep repeating person, animal or thing.
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:49.160]   I'm saying that because while grieving the loss of a person
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.240]   or a relationship with a person,
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.040]   doesn't have to be through death, of course,
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.120]   but death or otherwise,
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.320]   is something that we all can intuitively understand,
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.760]   even if we haven't experienced it.
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.080]   We are capable of achieving great attachments
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.920]   to animals as well.
[01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.760]   And while the loss of a thing of an object
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.500]   in no way, shape or form,
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.960]   approximately the loss of a person or an animal,
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.120]   I would never suggest that it does.
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.600]   It would also be naive and unfair of me
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.880]   or anyone else to suggest that things can't hold
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.300]   immense importance to us.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.320]   And that the loss of them can feel quite significant
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.660]   and invoke the grieving process.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.480]   This isn't always about materialism.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.400]   Sometimes it's purely about the sentimental attachment.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.040]   So for instance, the loss of a wedding ring
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.840]   or an engagement ring that was very meaningful to you,
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.800]   or an article of clothing or a painting,
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:43.320]   or even a small, seemingly an important object
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:44.140]   to somebody else,
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.300]   but something that held great meaning to you,
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.080]   maybe a seashell that you collected with somebody
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.040]   on the beach, and then somehow it gets lost.
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:53.620]   And it's the relationship with that person
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.700]   that's contained within that object for you
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:59.600]   as a representation within that object that's important.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.540]   That's the reason why I keep saying person, animal,
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.380]   or thing.
[01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:06.120]   I think it's only fair to include things in that category.
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:07.620]   But of course, with the understanding
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:11.260]   that they don't hold the absolute same magnitude
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.160]   as the loss of a being.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.160]   One thing that we ought to consider for a moment
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.360]   is whether or not the depth of attachment
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.800]   that you have to somebody predicts how long it will take
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.900]   for you to move through the loss of that person.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:25.380]   We often hear this.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.560]   Actually, I can remember some years ago,
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.800]   at the end of a relationship,
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.200]   a friend and colleague of mine saying,
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.860]   for every year that you were together,
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:38.100]   it's going to take you one month to get over that person.
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.220]   And I thought, well, where in the world
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.180]   do those data come from?
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.200]   And this is what I call anecdata or collective data,
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.080]   where this is like phrases such as,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.140]   absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:53.080]   And indeed sometimes absence can make the heart grow fonder
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.280]   in the context of two living people
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.220]   or people in a loving relationship,
[01:26:57.220 --> 01:26:59.600]   or even in the context of grief and loss.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.360]   But of course, there's absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.280]   And then you also will hear out of sight, out of mind.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.160]   And if you've been listening to this episode,
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.800]   clearly out of sight does not mean out of mind
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:13.600]   or out of emotional connection.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.680]   So these sayings of, well, it takes X number of months
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.760]   for a number of years, or out of sight, out of mind,
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:21.120]   your absence makes the heart grow fonder.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.660]   They really don't hold a lot of meaning,
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:25.300]   at least not for somebody like me who likes science
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.840]   because science is at least geared toward
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.360]   or aims towards establishing things in fact, not opinion,
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.900]   but also because science allows you to make predictions.
[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.620]   It allows you to orient yourself in a process
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.200]   and make predictions and understand.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:45.340]   So what are we to think of people who seem very,
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.060]   very attached to somebody,
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:50.000]   they break up and they seem just crushed, devastated,
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.840]   but three weeks later,
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.500]   they're in a new relationship and they seem perfectly fine,
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:57.020]   or somebody whose spouse dies,
[01:27:57.020 --> 01:27:59.340]   and then suddenly they're in a new relationship.
[01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.260]   I think there are rates of transition, if you will,
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:06.500]   that suggests some dysfunction, pathology, et cetera.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.640]   But here we aren't in a position to judge.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:11.360]   We're only in a position to speculate about this.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:14.000]   And I think we can reasonably speculate
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.300]   that it sort of makes sense
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.260]   why someone who has an intense attachment to somebody
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:24.160]   might be able to form a tense attachments generally, right?
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.500]   That they aren't restricted to one person,
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.700]   whereas other people who have an intense attachment
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.540]   to somebody might find themselves entirely incapable
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:33.200]   of moving on, or it would take them a very long time.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.300]   Hence the lines in the Feynman letter to Arlene
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:40.020]   about he had met various other young women,
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:41.020]   they seem perfectly nice,
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:43.660]   and yet they were meaningless to him
[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:46.440]   in the shadow of her memory,
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.640]   or we should say in the light of Arlene's memory
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.500]   or the memory of Arlene rather.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:54.500]   So these dimensionalities of attachment,
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500]   they cut in every direction.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:59.420]   And I don't think any well-trained psychologist
[01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.220]   or neuroscientist would ever say,
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.860]   oh, if you are somebody who becomes very attached,
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:05.660]   therefore it's very hard to move on.
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:06.580]   I think that could be true.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.820]   It could also be that if you're somebody
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.360]   who has a great capacity for attachment,
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:12.360]   you have a great capacity for attachment overall.
[01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.620]   Neuroscience nor psychology is really in a position
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:17.100]   to judge certainly,
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.580]   but it's also not in a position
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:19.740]   to make those kinds of predictions.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.820]   At least the field as it stands right now
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:25.180]   of attachment and grieving,
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.360]   can't really speak to why that's the case.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.020]   So that's my attempt to de-pathologize
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:31.500]   some of what we observe.
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.520]   Although I have to confess
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.400]   from a just sort of everyday stance
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.640]   that sometimes the rate in which people move
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.160]   out of attachments and grieving can be somewhat eerie.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.980]   I'd like to take a moment and explore this idea
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:48.100]   that allowing ourselves to really feel the attachment
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:50.020]   to somebody can accelerate
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.580]   or at least support adaptive transitioning through grief.
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.860]   There's a really wonderful study
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:00.200]   that on the face of it appears to be a,
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.860]   what we call negative result.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.740]   A negative result is when a hypothesis is posed
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.660]   and then turns out the hypothesis is not true.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:08.860]   But as is the case
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:11.100]   with so many interesting scientific findings,
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:13.960]   often when there's a negative result,
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.840]   there's a more interesting result nested
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.260]   in that negative outcome.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.620]   And this is the case in a particular paper
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.460]   I'll share with you now.
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.300]   There's a paper published
[01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.360]   in the journal biological psychology.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.340]   And again, the title is posed as a question,
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:29.700]   which is emotional disclosure for whom?
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.500]   A study of vagal tone in bereavement.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:35.640]   What this study explored was whether or not
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.120]   written disclosure of the emotional connection
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:41.420]   to somebody that was lost would be effective
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:45.380]   as a way for people to move through the grieving process.
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:49.320]   The study also explored the so-called vagus nerve.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.860]   The vagus nerve is an extensive nerve pathway
[01:30:51.860 --> 01:30:54.040]   that is bi-directional between brain and body.
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.540]   So brain to body and body to brain.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:59.940]   It generally is associated with calming effects
[01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:00.900]   on our brain and body,
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.860]   although that's certainly not always the case.
[01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.220]   The way to think about it in terms
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.660]   of what we're going to talk about now is heart rate
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.480]   and heart rate variability.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:12.460]   And in very simplistic terms,
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:15.700]   if your heart was just allowed to beat
[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.980]   at its sort of default rate,
[01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:21.560]   that rate would be rather high because of the activation
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.320]   of the so-called sympathetic arm
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.500]   of the autonomic nervous system,
[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:28.600]   the alertness component of the autonomic nervous system.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.760]   The parasympathetic nervous system as it's called
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   involves calming.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.100]   We sometimes hear sympathetic is for stress
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:37.460]   or fight or flight.
[01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.300]   It's for a lot of other things as well I should mention,
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:40.820]   and it is not for sympathy.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:42.100]   Simpa simply means together,
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.960]   and it reflects the activity of a bunch of neurons
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.280]   being active at the same time or together, simpa.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.840]   Whereas parasympathetic is often associated
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.220]   with quote unquote rest and digest functions
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:53.260]   or calming functions,
[01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:55.540]   although it is certainly involved in other things as well.
[01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:58.420]   So sympathetic nervous system drives alertness,
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.800]   panic, stress, et cetera.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:02.080]   Parasympathetic nervous system,
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.940]   meaning a distinct set of neurons drive calming,
[01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:09.860]   falling asleep, digestion, sexual arousal for that matter,
[01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:10.920]   and so on.
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.340]   So you sort of like a seesaw of alertness and calm,
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.180]   alertness and calm,
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:16.740]   sympathetic and parasympathetic, back and forth.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:19.160]   The vagus nerve is generally associated
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.120]   with parasympathetic functions
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:24.980]   and has the capacity to slow down our heart rate,
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.540]   in particular by exhales.
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.780]   And just simply because of the movement of the diaphragm
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.460]   and its relationship to the heart and the thoracic cavity,
[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:36.360]   exhales result in slowing down of the heart rate.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:41.160]   This is what we call an increased vagal tone.
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.140]   So let me explain for a moment.
[01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.400]   And actually here's a tool you can use,
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.240]   not just in terms of navigating grief,
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.720]   but in terms of stress modulation generally.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.560]   We have a muscle called the diaphragm.
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.680]   When we inhale, whether or not it's through our mouth
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.440]   or nose, our diaphragm moves down.
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.740]   As a consequence, there is more space overall
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.040]   in the thoracic cavity.
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.680]   The heart gets a little bit bigger,
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.300]   believe it or not, volume-wise.
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.800]   Blood flows more slowly through that large volume.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.420]   And there's a signal conveyed from the nervous system
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:13.460]   to the heart to speed the heart up.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.400]   So inhales literally speed your heart up.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:19.560]   And when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.720]   And as a consequence,
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.480]   there's less space in the thoracic cavity.
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.860]   Heart gets a little bit smaller.
[01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.780]   The existing blood volume in the heart at that time
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.960]   moves more quickly through that small volume, right?
[01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.180]   Given amount of blood volume,
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.700]   make the compartment it's in the heart smaller,
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.040]   and the blood moves more quickly through that volume.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.600]   And as a consequence, the nervous system sends a signal
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.040]   to the heart via the vagus and other pathways
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.380]   to slow the heart down.
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:44.560]   In other words, exhale, slow the heart down.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.200]   That process, that relationship between inhale,
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:49.900]   speeding the heart up, and exhale, slowing the heart down,
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:52.660]   is something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:56.720]   Some people are able to engage respiratory sinus arrhythmia
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.080]   more naturally, more reflexively than others.
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.600]   You can actually train this by consciously thinking
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.080]   about slowing your heart rate while you exhale
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.920]   and consciously thinking about increasing your heart rate
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.760]   as you inhale.
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.240]   You can literally strengthen these pathways.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.160]   Now, respiratory sinus arrhythmia
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.680]   and the ability to slow your heart rate with exhales
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:19.640]   is one dimension of what's called vagal tone,
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:22.720]   or your ability to control your overall level
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:25.240]   of activation of alertness and stress
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.800]   with these vagus nerve pathways.
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:29.600]   So vagal tone is something that varies
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.460]   from person to person.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.240]   If you've trained up or you've thought about
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.160]   your relationship between breath and heart rate,
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.320]   you can improve vagal tone.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:39.400]   Some people have very robust vagal tone
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.720]   without having done any training.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.660]   Other people have less of it, et cetera.
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.040]   I'll just paraphrase from this paper
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.440]   and you'll see where this takes us
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.600]   in terms of navigating grief, because it's quite important.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.020]   The vagus nerve provides inhibitory regulatory influence
[01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.940]   on the heart, allowing the heart rate to increase rapidly
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:56.900]   through vagal withdrawal.
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.120]   That means kind of coming off the brake
[01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.980]   of the parasympathetic nervous system
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:03.900]   as in response to a stressor in one's environment, right?
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:06.600]   When you're stressed, you rarely take the opportunity,
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.900]   if it's an immediate stress or threat, to actively exhale.
[01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:11.140]   That would be a great tool to use.
[01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.280]   And in fact, we promote that tool
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.580]   in our Mastering Stress episode.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.780]   Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs with an increase
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:18.220]   in sympathetic activation of the heart.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.760]   You now know what that is,
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.340]   or is known as the fight or flight response.
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:24.820]   Vagal tone reflects the degree to which there is tonic,
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:28.500]   meaning ongoing, vagal influence on the heart.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.060]   So when you have a high degree of vagal tone,
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:36.620]   it means that you are always activating that brake
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.820]   on your stress system, just at default.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.260]   And some people just happen to do that more.
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.660]   Other people need to practice long exhale breathing
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.040]   in order to build up vagal tone,
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.960]   something that's very useful to do,
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.860]   whether you're grieving or not.
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.240]   Now, in this study, what they did
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.500]   is they had people, and I should say it was 35 participants,
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:58.460]   go through a writing exercise for a period of weeks.
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.860]   They actually wrote about three times per week.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.920]   Then there was a follow-up at some period of time.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.420]   And then again, about a month later.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:06.800]   And there were two different groups.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:09.860]   One group was in the so-called written disclosure group.
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:12.300]   What they did is they, on day one,
[01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:16.180]   they would write about what happened when a loved one died.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:19.500]   And indeed they used people who had experienced real loss.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:23.060]   And so they were asked to talk about and write about
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.820]   their deepest emotions and thoughts about it,
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.860]   memories of their loved one.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:28.660]   Very intense stuff, if you think about it,
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.580]   if they're in the immediate period of having lost someone.
[01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.780]   Then they actually were asked to write a letter
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.180]   to the person that they lost.
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:39.060]   So again, a very intense exercise to go through
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.180]   if you did indeed lose somebody as these subjects had.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.620]   And then of course there was the testing
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:45.060]   some period of time later.
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:48.720]   And I'll tell you what that testing involved.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.680]   The other group was a so-called control group
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.220]   where they were simply told to write
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:54.520]   about how they use their time.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:56.960]   So an emotionally kind of empty writing exercise,
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.800]   if you will.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.040]   They described what they would do today
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.520]   after they woke up, et cetera.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:03.420]   No heavy emotional content and so on.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.880]   Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.680]   the immediate results of this study were a negative result,
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.700]   meaning no effect.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.240]   The disclosure that we should say
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.740]   the emotionally intense writing group and the control group
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.240]   did not differ at baseline on any symptom measures
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.300]   or psychological variables they tell us.
[01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:24.740]   And at least at face value, somewhat disappointingly,
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:28.420]   there really wasn't any kind of difference in outcome
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.080]   between the group that wrote
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.920]   about a very emotionally intense stuff
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.680]   versus non-emotionally intense.
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.840]   Now, what I didn't tell you thus far
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:38.480]   is why they had them do this exercise at all.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.760]   They had them do this exercise
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.760]   because many of the effective practices
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.960]   for moving through grief involve, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:49.840]   getting close to and actually deliberately experiencing
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.680]   the attachment that one has to that person that was lost,
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.480]   not distracting oneself,
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.920]   not getting into this counterfactual thinking,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.160]   the what if, what if, what if,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.420]   but rather thinking about, or in this case,
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:02.540]   writing about the real attachment.
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.800]   And so the initial idea was
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.480]   if people write about this attachment,
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.120]   that they're going to experience this attachment
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:11.060]   and that will serve them in some or many ways
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.000]   in terms of moving through grief.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.080]   And that wasn't what they found.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.920]   They found no difference between the two groups
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:20.920]   until they explored who had higher vagal tone,
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.160]   who had a greater degree
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.520]   of so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:29.240]   In other words, who was able to modulate their state
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:31.220]   using their breathing and their body.
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:34.840]   And what they discovered was that a subset of individuals
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.480]   who had a high degree of vagal tone
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.620]   seemed to get more benefit from this writing type exercise.
[01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:42.960]   Now, this is one study,
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.340]   and I would consider it fairly preliminary
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:47.840]   with 35 subjects, although, you know,
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.280]   it's a study unto itself and I think a quite nice one.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.520]   And it really set the stage for a number of other studies
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:55.800]   that followed from this group and other groups
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.640]   that really point to the fact that yes, indeed,
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.140]   accessing these states of emotionality by writing
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.320]   or thinking about somebody is quite powerful
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:07.460]   in terms of engaging the bodily states
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:09.560]   and the mind states associated with the attachment.
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.000]   And that is very beneficial for moving through grief.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.520]   That is very beneficial for sensing the attachment.
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.420]   And now it makes perfect sense as to why some people
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.960]   would benefit from that sort of practice more than others,
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:24.300]   because some people are able to access
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:27.720]   more real somatic feelings of attachment
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.120]   by writing about the attachment
[01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.080]   or by thinking about it than others.
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.260]   So this brings us back to an earlier discussion
[01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:35.680]   we were having where we were talking about
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:37.920]   how some people seem to move through things very quickly
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.080]   or don't seem to be grieving constantly.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.840]   And, you know, a spouse or a family member of that person
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:44.640]   might think, gosh, why aren't you upset?
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.860]   How is it that you can be functional and I'm not?
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.120]   Or how is it that you can be functional?
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.500]   There can even be fractures in families and relationships
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.960]   on the basis of differences in rates of grieving and so on.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.800]   Well, some of this, again, probably relates to psychology
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:59.360]   and the different attachments that people had
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:01.360]   to the person or animal or thing that was lost,
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:04.200]   but it no doubt also has to do
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.340]   with how much of a mind-body connection,
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:10.020]   how much of a vagal tone exists in the person
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.500]   when they suddenly found themselves in the grief episode.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.780]   So this actually offers multiple opportunities.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:17.360]   If you're somebody, for instance,
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.900]   who is grieving so intensely and so often
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:22.700]   that you're finding it immensely difficult
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:25.260]   to move through grief at a reasonable rate,
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:26.620]   and you might even say,
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:29.160]   or find yourself diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.020]   or with complicated grief syndrome in a way
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.840]   that's really impairing your adaptive functioning in life,
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:38.200]   well, then it's not clear to me,
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.960]   at least by my read of the data,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.040]   that you would want to engage in a lot of practices
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.080]   to increase the mind-body relationship
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.880]   and feeling so much of this attachment
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.940]   because you're already feeling an immense amount of it.
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:52.720]   Whereas other people who are feeling challenged
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.720]   in accessing the feelings of attachment
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:59.320]   and perhaps not functioning well as a consequence of that
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.080]   might find that practicing breathing
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.360]   in order to encourage respiratory signs of arrhythmia,
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.320]   again, focusing on slowing your heart rate consciously
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.360]   while you exhale and concentrating
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.640]   on increasing your heart rate as you inhale,
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.900]   even just as a brief practice
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:16.760]   of even just one to three minutes or one to five minutes
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.580]   every once in a while or per day,
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:19.960]   that could be immensely beneficial
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.560]   in building this mind-body relationship.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.680]   Because again, what this paper really points to
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.960]   and set off a number of other investigations related to
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.560]   is that for those that can really feel the relationship
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:34.040]   between breathing, heart rate, what we call vagal tone,
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.320]   well, those people are going to be in a better position
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.160]   to move through grief,
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.460]   not because they are disengaging
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:42.000]   from the feelings of attachment,
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.280]   but because they are better able to access
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:45.800]   those feelings of attachment.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.520]   So what this relates to, of course, is that tripartite map,
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.480]   that three-part map that we talked about earlier,
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.700]   that representation of space, where things are,
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:57.520]   where the person is, where their belongings are,
[01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.780]   where their car is, where their bicycle is,
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.520]   time, when you were expecting to see them
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:05.200]   on a regular basis, when they would call,
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.540]   when they would come home from work, et cetera,
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.680]   and that third node or that third dimension of attachment,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.620]   which is literally attachment and closeness.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:15.280]   Well, what we're talking about here
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.080]   is anchoring to that attachment
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.440]   and really feeling into that,
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:23.040]   but then disengaging from the space and time map
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:24.480]   that we call episodic memory,
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.600]   that menu of prior experiences
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:29.880]   that keeps us in many ways maladaptively
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:32.920]   in an expectation of what never can be again.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.840]   Now I'd like to take a moment
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.940]   and consider some of the tools that you can access
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:39.720]   that support healthy transitioning through grief.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.160]   And these are tools distinct from that neural map,
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.400]   that space, time, and closeness attachment map
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.120]   that we were talking about before.
[01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.440]   Rather, it's important to remind ourselves
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.080]   that everything exists in a context
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:54.160]   of our baseline physiology.
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.160]   And I'm certainly not going to be the first
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.320]   or the last to tell you that everything in life,
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:02.360]   learning, relationships with people that are still around,
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.040]   our health in every way, immune system, et cetera,
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.900]   function far better when we're sleeping really well
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.160]   and when we are generally awake during the daytime
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.520]   and asleep at night.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.420]   I realize there are shift workers out there,
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:17.680]   people who are traveling and are jet lagged.
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.640]   First of all, thank you, shift workers, we rely on you.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.600]   We have an episode all about jet lag and shift work for you
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.400]   and for trying to maintain the best possible mental
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:28.780]   and physical health in the face of ongoing shift work
[01:43:28.780 --> 01:43:30.480]   and jet lag, you can find that episode
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.280]   on our website, hubramlabs.com.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.180]   Lots of behavioral tools, some other tools as well.
[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:39.480]   Nonetheless, human beings are diurnal.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.640]   We were really designed to be awake mostly in the day
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.960]   and asleep at night.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.120]   There are rare exceptions to this
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.840]   where people like to stay up late and sleep in late,
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:51.800]   but we are a diurnal species by way of our genetic wiring
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.560]   and our neural circuit wiring.
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.320]   There's a particular feature to our diurnal,
[01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.560]   and diurnal meaning the opposite of nocturnal,
[01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:02.740]   our diurnal pattern of the release
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:04.840]   of a hormone called cortisol.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.660]   Cortisol is a stress hormone, it's sometimes called,
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.940]   but cortisol has a lot of other effects,
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:10.880]   many of which are positive.
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.100]   Cortisol, for instance, protects us against infection.
[01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:17.140]   It can help us in terms of waking up in the morning.
[01:44:17.140 --> 01:44:19.500]   In fact, the pulse as it's called
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.880]   or the spike in cortisol early in the day
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.240]   is part of the reason we wake up.
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.220]   It's linked to our increase in temperature rhythms
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.000]   and can further increase our temperature,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.600]   which leads to waking and so on.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.360]   The typical pattern of cortisol in a healthy individual,
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.380]   and we really can say physically
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:38.500]   and emotionally healthy individual,
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.360]   is that cortisol is going to be somewhat high
[01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:45.060]   right around waking, and then is going to be highest
[01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:47.540]   as it ever will be in the 24 hour period,
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.060]   about 45 minutes post waking.
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.780]   Not exactly 45 minutes, but about 45 minutes.
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:55.460]   And then it will drop gradually
[01:44:55.460 --> 01:44:58.220]   such that by about 4 p.m. in the afternoon,
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.180]   which is actually when body temperature
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:02.340]   tends to start to drop as well,
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:04.060]   cortisol tends to be very low,
[01:45:04.060 --> 01:45:07.160]   and then remains low in a healthy individual,
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.700]   such that at 9 p.m. it's very low,
[01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:12.020]   and throughout the night as we sleep, it's very low.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:16.740]   In fact, spikes or pulses in 9 p.m. cortisol
[01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:20.380]   are a fairly reliable biomarker readout
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.100]   of certain forms of depression and chronic anxiety.
[01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.540]   This relates to the beautiful work
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:25.740]   of my colleagues at Stanford
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.900]   and Stanford School of Medicine,
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.940]   Dr. David Spiegel, who's been on this podcast,
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.460]   and Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who has also been on this podcast.
[01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:36.580]   There's a very interesting paper
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:40.300]   exploring the relationship between cortisol rhythms
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:42.260]   and grieving, in particular,
[01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:44.500]   complicated versus non-complicated grieving.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.380]   Again, complicated grieving being the form of grieving
[01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:49.460]   that reflects a immense challenge
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:51.020]   of people moving through the grieving process
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:54.500]   such that it really needs to be dealt with, right?
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:55.740]   Again, grieving is healthy,
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:58.160]   but complicated grieving is a prolonged grieving
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.620]   and has other dimensions as well,
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.900]   hence the name complicated.
[01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.820]   The title of this paper is
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:06.540]   diurnal cortisol in complicated and non-complicated grief,
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:09.100]   slope differences across the day.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:11.820]   And the figure to orient to in this paper,
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.100]   if you do decide to check it out,
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:15.600]   and we'll put a link to it,
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.220]   is figure one, which beautifully shows,
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:21.700]   or I should say very clearly shows,
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:26.140]   that in individuals that are experiencing complicated grief,
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.080]   there's the same general contour
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.080]   of high cortisol upon waking,
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.620]   even higher about 45 minutes after waking,
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.300]   and then a reduction in cortisol by 4 p.m.
[01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.280]   and even further reduction by 9 p.m.,
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.780]   so just as it were in a typical individual
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:42.620]   or somebody who is in non-complicated grieving.
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:45.340]   However, when you compare the cortisol levels
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.020]   between people experiencing complicated grieving
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.740]   versus non-complicated grieving,
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:54.000]   what you find is the 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. cortisol levels
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.900]   are significantly higher
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:59.580]   than they are in the non-complicated grieving group.
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:02.020]   This raises a very interesting idea
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.500]   and relates very closely
[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.120]   to what we were talking about with vagal tone.
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:07.660]   You could imagine a situation
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:11.380]   in which people who are experiencing complicated grief
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:14.880]   have higher levels of afternoon and nighttime cortisol
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.260]   because they are in complicated grief,
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:19.300]   but you could also imagine the opposite,
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.740]   that they're experiencing complicated grief
[01:47:21.740 --> 01:47:24.980]   because of the fact that they have elevated cortisol.
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:27.820]   Now, it's very likely that it's bi-directional,
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:31.200]   that the answer isn't one or the other, but both,
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.580]   that complicated grief changes patterns of cortisol
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:37.260]   and that patterns of cortisol change the likelihood
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.860]   that one has complicated grief.
[01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:43.100]   That's the most logical interpretation of data like these.
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.340]   However, when taken along with the data on vagal tone,
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:50.640]   that people who have a higher level of vagal tone
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:54.460]   are better able to navigate situations
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:56.100]   of the sort that we're talking about,
[01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:00.020]   and that some people perhaps have oxytocin receptors
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.740]   or patterns of catecholamines or epinephrine
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.760]   that position them to be more likely to grieve
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.020]   in a particular way,
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:10.260]   we arrive at a scenario where it makes very good sense
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.220]   to think about modulating,
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:15.200]   that is controlling the foundation of your life
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:18.080]   in a way that establishes cortisol rhythms
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.120]   and sleep patterns and patterns of autonomic arousal
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:23.900]   and catecholamine release that position you
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:28.020]   to navigate the grief process in the best possible way.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.400]   If that was a complicated mouthful to digest,
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.840]   let me restate it in a simpler way.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:36.040]   If you are somebody who is heading into grief
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.000]   or is challenged with grief, complicated grief or otherwise,
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.980]   prolonged grief or otherwise,
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:44.280]   getting adequate sleep at night
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   and establishing as normal a pattern of cortisol as possible
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:51.260]   is going to be very important.
[01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:53.620]   And there's a very simple, straightforward way to do this.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.180]   And I apologize to the listeners of this podcast in advance
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:57.500]   if I sound like a repeating record,
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.940]   but the most powerful way to do this
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.980]   is to view sunlight very close to waking.
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:05.620]   It does not have to be right at sunrise,
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:09.500]   but when you get up in the morning, if the sun isn't out,
[01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.980]   please turn on as many bright lights
[01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.100]   as possible in your environment.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:16.480]   And then once the sun is out,
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.860]   try and get some bright sunlight in your eyes.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.260]   Never look at any light so bright
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.980]   that it's painful to look at sunlight or otherwise.
[01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.380]   If you live in an area of the world
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:27.460]   where there isn't a lot of sunlight,
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:29.660]   please keep in mind that sunlight coming through cloud cover
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:32.260]   is going to still be a very effective mechanism
[01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:33.940]   for establishing this cortisol rhythm.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:35.260]   Why do I say this thing about sunlight
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.740]   over and over and over again?
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:39.700]   Well, having an early day cortisol peak
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:43.820]   and a very low cortisol level late in the day,
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.340]   4 p.m. and 9 p.m. is immensely beneficial.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:50.980]   It reflects a properly regulated autonomic nervous system.
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:52.300]   It means being alert during the day
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:55.320]   and your ability to sleep at night is tightly correlated
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:57.700]   to this viewing of sunlight in the morning.
[01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.680]   If you have additional questions about this
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.660]   or these protocols, please see our Mastering Sleep episode
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:04.980]   also at hubermanlab.com.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.860]   But in brief, you don't want to wear sunglasses
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:08.700]   when you do this.
[01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:11.780]   Do not want to do this through a window or a windshield.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.740]   It is 50 times less effective at least
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:15.760]   because of filtering of the proper wavelengths.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:18.140]   It is fine to wear eyeglasses,
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:19.780]   meaning corrective lenses or contacts,
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.460]   even if they have UV protection.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.260]   Again, sunlight is best, 10 minutes to 30 minutes,
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.600]   depending on how bright it is outside
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.300]   and so on and so forth.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.740]   I keep coming back to this protocol
[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.460]   because first of all, it is a zero cost,
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:35.220]   but very effective way to regulate
[01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:37.400]   things like cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms,
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:39.000]   wakefulness during the day,
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.300]   ease of falling asleep at night and so on.
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:42.280]   And second of all,
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:46.000]   because I want to emphasize this idea of modulation.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.020]   There are processes in our brain and body
[01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:51.300]   which directly mediate some psychological effect
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.320]   or physiological effect, right?
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.960]   Dopamine is directly involved in motivation.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:58.500]   If you're somebody who struggles with motivation,
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.820]   your dopamine system is likely to be dysregulated
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.300]   in some way, and there are behavioral tools
[01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:03.880]   and other tools to adjust that.
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:06.240]   We had an episode on dopamine motivation and drive
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:09.140]   that talks extensively about those tools.
[01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.740]   However, the process of grief can't be distilled
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.960]   down to one molecule, one circuit such that we can say,
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:18.540]   oh, you know, take this supplement or eat this diet
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.840]   and or exercise in the following way,
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.540]   and you'll recover from grief more quickly.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:24.900]   It's simply not the case.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.840]   It is the case, however, that proper sleep at night
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:32.220]   sets the foundation for the proper emotional tone
[01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:35.680]   to be able to navigate physical, psychological,
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.940]   and other types of challenges.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:41.180]   And not incidentally, sleep at night, I should say,
[01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:43.860]   sufficient duration and quality of sleep at night
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:46.180]   is the way in which you engage neuroplasticity,
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:47.980]   the reordering of neural connections.
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.460]   And everything we've been talking about today
[01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:52.720]   about reordering of the maps in your mind,
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.880]   this tripartite, three-part map of space, time,
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:57.580]   and closeness involves neuroplasticity,
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:00.500]   the reconfiguring of connections between neurons,
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:03.540]   strengthening certain pathways and not strengthening others,
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:07.120]   actively trying to disengage from the what if, right?
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.320]   This counterintuitive thinking,
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:11.220]   actively trying to disengage from the expectations
[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.640]   that someone will be there.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.200]   Although when you find yourself doing that,
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:18.400]   understanding why it's so reflexive and normal to do that,
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.760]   actively trying to lean into the real attachment
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.280]   to somebody, animal or thing.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:28.480]   And yet at the same time, not deluding yourself
[01:52:28.480 --> 01:52:30.920]   and undermining the whole process of grieving
[01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.760]   by trying to imagine that they are in fact
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.680]   still truly there, right?
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:38.240]   It's a very narrow knife edge of a process,
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.400]   which is why it's so challenging.
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:41.940]   Regulating your cortisol rhythm
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:44.280]   through viewing sunlight early in the day.
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.560]   And I should also say avoiding bright lights
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.360]   from artificial sources in the evening,
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:51.040]   generally 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.,
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:53.540]   but certainly in the evening,
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.020]   trying to dim lights in your immediate environment,
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:58.920]   trying to avoid bright screens, bright artificial lights
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:01.520]   as much as possible, and accessing that deep sleep.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:05.580]   That's modulating, it's setting an overall autonomic state
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:08.360]   or an overall autonomic landscape,
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.200]   would be the better way to describe it,
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:12.600]   that's going to allow you to sleep and get neuroplasticity,
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.340]   sleep and be in the best emotional state
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.780]   to navigate the grieving process,
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:19.240]   because it's only fair to say that the grieving process
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.720]   as we're describing it is hard,
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:23.480]   and not just because it's emotionally hard,
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:24.960]   it's cognitively hard.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.400]   You just think about what's required
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.960]   to move through grief properly, if you will.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:33.560]   It's thinking about and actually physically experiencing
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:37.580]   the depth, the full depth of the attachment to the person,
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:39.480]   while at the same time trying to uncouple
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:44.040]   from that rich menu, that catalog of episodic memories
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.680]   that can date back many, many years
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:46.840]   and have so much richness,
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:49.940]   so many predictions form on the basis
[01:53:49.940 --> 01:53:51.240]   of those episodic memories,
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:53.440]   and actively trying to distance ourselves
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.500]   from those memories by being very anchored
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.760]   in the fact that we are present,
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.720]   we are the person alone in that room,
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:02.280]   or in some cases with a bereavement group in that room,
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.440]   or with other people that are mourning the loss
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:06.760]   of that individual animal or thing.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   And that knife edge of feeling the intense attachment
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.920]   while also disengaging from all the things
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.080]   that led to that attachment,
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.080]   well, it's understandable why that would be so challenging.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.520]   And it should also be understandable
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:24.720]   why positioning yourself to be able to do that
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:28.040]   in the best possible way requires proper sleep.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.640]   So what are the tools that we can think about using
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:33.440]   in terms of healthy adaptive moving through grief,
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.280]   trying to avoid complicated grief
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:38.480]   and prolonged grief disorders?
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:41.040]   I realize that word disorder implies all sorts of things,
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.080]   but again, those are just naming categorizations
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:47.520]   that people come up with that I think fairly reflect
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.720]   the fact that some people have more challenge
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.840]   moving through grieving than others.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.120]   And for some people, it can be very extended.
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.640]   I think the common misunderstanding
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.700]   is that proper grieving involves
[01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.080]   moving through something quickly.
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.400]   We're certainly not saying that.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:07.160]   However, it is very clear that some people can get stuck.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.280]   And that process of getting stuck,
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:13.560]   you should now understand has a lot to do with maintaining
[01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:15.720]   or reactivating those episodic memories,
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.040]   those expectations of where somebody
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:19.460]   will be in space and time.
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:23.480]   So what can we say about the tools for moving through grief?
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.320]   Clearly it's a value to dedicate some period of time,
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.760]   perhaps every day, perhaps every other day,
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:32.200]   depending on your capacity and schedule.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.940]   These could be periods of time ranging anywhere
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.340]   from five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:42.280]   These blocks of time would be appropriately described
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:44.980]   as rational grieving, right?
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:49.200]   Rational grieving is a clear acceptance of the new reality
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.780]   that the person, animal or thing no longer exists
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.000]   in the same space time dimensionality
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.480]   that we knew them before.
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:57.820]   And yet holding onto and anchoring
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:56:00.120]   to the attachment that we had.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:03.860]   This is again, not an unhealthy anchoring to the attachment.
[01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:05.820]   This is really anchoring to the depth
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:08.500]   and the intensity of the attachment that existed
[01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:12.660]   as a way to, for lack of a better way to put it,
[01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:15.500]   push off from those episodic memories,
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:16.860]   to distance ourselves from them.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:19.460]   Because those episodic memories are the ones
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:22.840]   that lead us to look for the person in our current reality.
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.480]   And assuming this is a real and complete loss,
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.820]   those sorts of expectations are maladaptive.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.240]   They do not serve us well.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:33.480]   The second aspect of this is to understand
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.160]   that the node of the map,
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:40.160]   the component of the neural map that you're anchoring to
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:41.700]   is a very real component of you.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:42.760]   These are literally cells
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.120]   that represent the depth of attachment.
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.480]   They are linked up with your emotional centers in the brain.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.540]   And indeed they're linked up with your body.
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:51.960]   I think one of the things that comes up so often
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.960]   when people are grieving is why does it hurt so much?
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:57.600]   Well, that hurt is that yearning.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:01.200]   It's that anticipation of action that you want to engage in.
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:04.840]   But some part of you at least knows that it leads nowhere.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:06.640]   It's that reaching for that glass of water
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:09.280]   in a kind of desert of thirst.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.020]   And you know you can't have it.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.120]   That's why it hurts so badly
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.400]   because the systems of your brain and body
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.440]   are in a place of anticipation of readiness.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:21.500]   And given the activation of these brain reward systems
[01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:22.960]   like the nucleus accumbens,
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:25.400]   given your now understanding of oxytocin
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.000]   being more enriched in the, excuse me,
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.420]   in the nucleus accumbens of some individuals
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:33.320]   and as opposed to others,
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.320]   it should make perfect sense
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.480]   as to why it's so painful in your body.
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.120]   We talked a moment ago about the importance
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:42.320]   of accessing quality sleep on a regular basis,
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.960]   gave you at least one tool to do that.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:46.160]   There again, a rich array of tools
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:48.440]   to do that in the Mastering Sleep episode.
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.240]   And again, highlighting the importance of sleep
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:54.840]   for not just emotion regulation and autonomic control,
[01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.680]   which is so vital,
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:58.420]   but also for making sure that neuroplasticity takes place.
[01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:00.680]   Because again, neuroplasticity is a two-part process.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.200]   There's the triggering of the plasticity,
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:04.920]   which in the case of the things we're talking about today
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:08.040]   will be naturally activated by the practice
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.360]   of a dedicated focusing on the attachment,
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.680]   feeling the attachment to the person,
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:14.200]   maybe even writing about the attachment to the person
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:16.400]   as was described in that previous study.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.200]   But also just the plasticity is triggered
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:21.740]   by the mere loss of that person,
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:23.100]   the intensity of that experience.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:26.260]   But neuroplasticity, the literal rewiring of connections
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:28.460]   occurs during deep sleep
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:31.360]   and in what I call non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:32.840]   And you can find NSDR scripts.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:34.760]   These are short behavioral protocols
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.700]   that you do for 10 to 30 minutes
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.740]   at some point throughout the day,
[01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:38.960]   maybe even multiple times through the day
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.860]   that have been shown to accelerate neuroplasticity.
[01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:45.640]   So having such a practice can be very useful
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.880]   and understand that it involves some cognitive work.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:50.480]   We have to hold onto the attachment
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.560]   and imagine and feel as much as we can the attachment
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:57.420]   while also being extremely rationally grounded
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:01.500]   and trying to not try to hold onto the past,
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:04.460]   trying to not anticipate the person walking in the room.
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:05.480]   This is very hard
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:07.600]   because when we think about the attachment,
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:10.320]   the attachment tends to drag with it
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:13.720]   those episodic memories, that rich catalog of experiences.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.640]   The expectation that they walk in the room
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.300]   is perfectly natural.
[01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:19.180]   The hard cognitive work
[01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:23.160]   is to experience the deep emotional attachment
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:25.580]   while at the same time severing from
[01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:28.860]   or distancing ourselves from these expectations
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:30.700]   that they'll suddenly show up in our reality
[01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:32.180]   when in fact they won't.
[01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:36.720]   And we talked about preparing ourselves for grief.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:39.300]   And if we have a loved one that's dying
[01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:41.360]   or we anticipate that at some point
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:43.700]   we are going to have a loss of some sort,
[01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:46.100]   could be death, could be a loss of another type,
[01:59:46.100 --> 01:59:47.560]   breakup, et cetera,
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:51.460]   that we can prepare ourselves to grieve more adaptively
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:54.140]   by regulating the level of catecholamines,
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:55.660]   in particular epinephrine.
[01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:56.980]   That was well-described
[01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:58.940]   in the study that I referred to earlier.
[01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.020]   And tools such as the one found
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:02.580]   in our Mastering Stress episode
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.300]   and tools of the sort that we talked about today,
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:07.300]   increasing that vagal tone
[02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:11.000]   by actively building up the relationship between exhales
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.060]   and slowing down of the heart rate,
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:15.180]   so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
[02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:16.740]   Those things can be very useful tools.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:20.500]   So we can actually encourage our nervous system
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:21.780]   and build our nervous system
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:23.820]   and build our mind to prepare for grief
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:25.460]   when it inevitably will come.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:28.500]   Again, this is not about buffering ourselves
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:29.700]   from the realities of life.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:33.400]   This is not about engaging from grief
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.420]   as a real and important process.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:38.700]   And indeed it is a real and important process to engage in.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:40.900]   Those that enter denial
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.820]   or trying to distract themselves with substances
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:47.460]   or thinking or distracting of behavior,
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.200]   substances or otherwise,
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:50.980]   won't move through grief as well,
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.080]   as adaptively as those who embrace a process
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.500]   of the sort that I'm describing here.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:58.500]   And of course, I want to restate again
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:01.260]   that even though grief and depression
[02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:04.260]   are now known to be fundamentally different,
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.700]   even though people move through the different stages of grief
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.980]   at different rates and sometimes skip stages, et cetera,
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:11.720]   it is often important to access
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.900]   a trained professional psychologist or psychiatrist
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.900]   or both or bereavement group or all of the above
[02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:21.620]   in order to get the proper support for grieving.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:26.620]   So this is a podcast about science and science-based tools,
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:29.580]   but I absolutely want to emphasize
[02:01:29.580 --> 02:01:31.980]   that there are terrific resources out there
[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:33.500]   that you can access.
[02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:35.220]   I don't say this in any kind of glib
[02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:37.580]   or kind of pass the buck kind of way.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:41.940]   There are wonderful trained therapists, bereavement groups,
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:45.720]   psychiatrists that are expert
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:47.740]   in navigating these sorts of things.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:50.700]   I like to think that the tools that we've talked about today
[02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:52.580]   would be not only compatible,
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.020]   but would be complimentary
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:56.280]   to the sorts of approaches that they take.
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:59.500]   And as we think about this process of grief,
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:02.620]   as we all should at some point in our lives,
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.560]   because we all indeed will experience grief
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:05.820]   in one form or another,
[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:10.160]   I would hope that the information that we discussed today
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:13.120]   would not only give you some tools,
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.980]   but hopefully give you a better understanding
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:17.520]   of not just the people that you've lost
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:18.580]   or that you stand to lose,
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:21.800]   not just the animals that you've lost and stand to lose,
[02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:24.020]   but also give you a sense of why it is
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:26.360]   that the people who are still in your life
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:27.200]   and that you're attached to,
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.760]   the animals that are still in your life
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:31.860]   that you're attached to have such profound meaning for you.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:35.160]   And I would encourage you to not lean away from,
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:37.260]   but rather to lean into the building
[02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:39.260]   of those episodic memories,
[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:42.740]   to build up a richer and richer set of experiences
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:44.620]   and emotional attachments.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:47.060]   Because while the process of grieving
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:50.220]   is in direct relation to how close we are attached to people,
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:51.940]   there are ways to move through it.
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:54.540]   And of course it is the depth of our attachments
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:57.220]   and the number and the depth of meaning of experiences
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:59.580]   that we share with others and with animals
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:02.300]   that makes life so rich and worth living.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:04.200]   So I just want to take a moment and say thank you
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.940]   for being willing to explore this rather complicated
[02:03:07.940 --> 02:03:11.740]   and sometimes extremely challenging thing that we call grief
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:13.580]   from the perspective or through the lens
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:15.740]   of neuroscience and psychology.
[02:03:15.740 --> 02:03:18.260]   I certainly learned a lot in exploring this literature.
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:21.020]   I also really look forward to hosting people
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:25.500]   like Dr. O'Connor on the podcast and others on the podcast
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:27.980]   who've done such beautiful work in this area.
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.140]   I've put out the request and hopefully they'll join us soon
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.420]   to further elaborate and teach us
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:36.260]   about this fundamental component of our lives.
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.980]   If you're learning from and are enjoying this podcast,

[02:04:03.940 --> 02:04:05.620]   at the beginning of today's podcast.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.540]   That's the best way to support us.
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.140]   Not during today's episode, but on many previous episodes
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:13.140]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we've discussed supplements.
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:14.980]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.340]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:21.140]   for things like easing and accelerating the transition time
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:23.980]   into sleep and getting better, deeper sleep,
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:27.080]   as well as things such as focus, et cetera.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.260]   We've partnered with Momentous Supplements
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.860]   because Momentous Supplements, first of all,
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:32.960]   are of extremely high quality.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.420]   That's obviously important.
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:36.060]   Also, they ship internationally.
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:37.160]   We had heard from many of you
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:38.780]   that you were having trouble accessing
[02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:41.000]   some of the supplements that were described
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.040]   on the Huberman Lab podcast
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.320]   because you did not live in the US.
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.620]   Momentous ships both within the US and abroad.
[02:04:46.620 --> 02:04:48.840]   And many of you have also requested
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:51.600]   that there be a single site where you could access
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:53.460]   all of the supplements that we've talked about
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:55.580]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:59.300]   Right now at livemomentous.com/huberman,
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.380]   you can find a subset of the supplements
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.260]   that have been described on this podcast.
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:05.700]   Again, all of the very highest quality,
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.460]   each single ingredient supplements,
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:08.540]   that turns out to be very important
[02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:10.620]   if you're trying to develop the proper array
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:11.520]   of supplements for you.
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:13.360]   It's not helpful to have supplements
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.580]   that include many ingredients.
[02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:16.300]   So we encourage Momentous
[02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:19.500]   to have single ingredient supplements with dosages
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:22.740]   that allow you to build up from the minimal effective dose
[02:05:22.740 --> 02:05:23.860]   and so on.
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:25.100]   And the catalog of supplements
[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:26.900]   they are going to add to that location,
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:28.900]   livemomentous.com/huberman
[02:05:28.900 --> 02:05:31.220]   is going to expand in the weeks and months to come.
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:34.580]   And we expect that in fairly short amount of time,
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:36.080]   all of the supplements that we've described
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:38.020]   on the Huberman Lab podcast will be there.
[02:05:38.020 --> 02:05:39.800]   If you're not already following Huberman Lab
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:41.580]   on Instagram and Twitter,
[02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:43.920]   I post science and science related tools
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.540]   at Huberman Lab on Instagram,
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:47.980]   also at Huberman Lab on Twitter.
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:50.120]   Oftentimes that material will overlap somewhat
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:52.160]   with the content covered on this podcast,
[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:53.960]   but more often than not,
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:55.400]   what I'm covering on Instagram and Twitter
[02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.440]   is distinct from the information I cover
[02:05:57.440 --> 02:05:59.200]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.680]   We also have a newsletter that has summaries of podcasts
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:04.600]   and points to specific protocols
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:06.760]   and links that could be useful to you.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:09.080]   That is the neural network newsletter.
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:11.360]   And you can find it at HubermanLab.com.
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.800]   Go to the menu, go to newsletter.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.740]   You can sign up simply by giving us your email.
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.780]   We do not share your email with anybody else.
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:19.660]   Our privacy policy is there and is made very clear.
[02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:22.740]   You can also see some newsletters of months past.
[02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:23.900]   So you can assess whether or not
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:25.400]   you really do want to sign up.
[02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:26.860]   Although I like to think that you will.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:30.300]   Again, zero cost, total privacy of your email account.
[02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:33.400]   And many people find those summaries and takeaway tools
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.820]   to be very useful in navigating
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:38.500]   these admittedly long podcast episodes.
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.780]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:42.620]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:45.200]   [upbeat music]
[02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.780]   (upbeat music)
