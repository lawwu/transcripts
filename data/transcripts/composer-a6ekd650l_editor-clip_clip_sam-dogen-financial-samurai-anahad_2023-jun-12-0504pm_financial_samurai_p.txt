[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.440]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.140]   And in this episode, I have a special guest with me, Anahad O'Connor.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.920]   And I didn't realize, Anahad, you have a Wikipedia page.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.360]   So I'm going to read it to you really quickly.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   Born May 23, 1981, is an American journalist and staff reporter for the New York Times.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.940]   Well, he was for 20 years.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.840]   He joined the Times in 2003 and writes about consumer health, science, and national issues.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.280]   He's also a bestselling author.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.920]   He went to Yale.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   His book, The 10 Things You Need to Eat, made the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.260]   And now he is a part of the Washington Post.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.940]   So welcome to the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.940]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.940]   I appreciate it.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.240]   Thanks for that nice introduction, although I think that Wikipedia page needs updating.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.280]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.280]   You got one on.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280]   I don't think I have one.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.280]   Maybe I can try to create one on my own.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280]   I don't know how that works.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   Yeah, I'm not even sure who created that.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   So.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   OK.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   So for 20 years, you've been writing about health.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280]   Yes?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   Health and fitness?
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   Yes.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   So I started at the New York Times actually right out of college.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.680]   I graduated in 1999, joined the New York Times in the science section, did several years
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.280]   there.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560]   And then I moved around to some other desks, the Metro desk.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.400]   I covered national news, breaking news.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.760]   But health has always been my passion.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.280]   And so I made my way back to covering health after a brief detour.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280]   Got it.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.040]   And also on the Wikipedia page, it says he was part of the first class of the New York
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.960]   Times College Scholarship Program in 1999.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.640]   What is that or what was that?
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.640]   Yes.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.180]   So the New York Times College Scholarship was started in 1999.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.380]   It was basically started by the publisher and some top editors at the Times as a way
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.940]   to provide college scholarships to promising young New York high school students.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.820]   And I was in the first class.
[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.060]   There were six of us.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.780]   And they actually wrote an article about us in the New York Times.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.740]   So that was the first time my name appeared in the New York Times, is when I won this
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.940]   inaugural college scholarship.
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.580]   And it became it got such great positive feedback.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.980]   It became so popular that people wanted to support it.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.380]   And all this money and donations poured in and they were able to award 15 other scholarships
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.380]   that year.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.900]   So it grew from a class of six high school students to 21.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.100]   And basically high school students born and raised in New York, high school students from
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.260]   New York City who overcame challenges and showed promise.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.700]   That is actually how I ended up working for the New York Times because I got an internship
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.380]   as part of the college scholarship program.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.060]   And I wanted to go to college and become a doctor.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.940]   And so I asked to become to be an intern in the science department because I grew up reading
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.540]   Science Times.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.780]   And so I started as an intern in the science department.
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.700]   And then I kept coming back year after year.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.500]   And then I eventually joined the New York Times as a cub reporter and then became a
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   staff reporter.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.340]   And so as you can see, I gave up my dreams of becoming a doctor and became a health journalist
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.700]   because I felt that I could have a much bigger impact in the world of health by doing this
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   journalism.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.620]   Mad Fientist Well, it must not have been easy getting that
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.940]   scholarship.
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.860]   Do you mind sharing, is it possible, what kind of financial aid that was?
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.540]   And was it implicit that if you did well in college, you would be able to get a job at
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.540]   the New York Times afterwards?
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.460]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani It wasn't implicit.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.460]   So the scholarship was $48,000 at the time.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.460]   Mad Fientist Wow, that's great.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.700]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, over the course of four years.
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.020]   So it was $12,000 a year.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.460]   And back then, college was very expensive but not as expensive as it is now.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.380]   I think tuition was maybe like $230,000 and $3,500 a year and I got accepted to Yale.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.060]   And so I applied that to Yale.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.620]   I think for the purposes of your podcast, I can say that it was one of several scholarships
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.980]   that I got for private scholarships because I grew up in a very poor neighborhood in New
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:22.980]   York City.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.060]   I was one of seven children raised in a single parent household.
[00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.420]   And you know, I remember reading when I was young that college was very expensive and
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.380]   I knew I wanted to go to college and I had dreams of becoming a scientist.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.860]   First I wanted to become a nuclear chemist, a physicist.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.060]   And then when I got to college, it was my dream was to become a doctor.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.140]   So I kind of changed along the way.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.140]   But I knew that, you know, you know, my mom told me from a young age that we couldn't
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.140]   really afford college.
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.860]   So when I was in high school, I decided I got to figure out a way to pay for college.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.540]   You know, and I just saw the price tag and thought this is, you know, a year of college
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.940]   is more than my mother makes in a year.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.940]   So how am I going to pay for this?
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.020]   And so I made it my job at that time to find private scholarships.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.500]   And so I got the New York Times scholarship, which was $48,000.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.380]   And then I also got another scholarship called the Ron Brown Scholarship Program, which was
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.380]   $40,000.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.380]   Wow.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.100]   Oh my gosh, that's a lot.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.180]   So I ended up racking up over $100,000 in private scholarships.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.500]   And so college was all paid for.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   Wow.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   Congratulations.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.260]   Did you get the scholarships before or after you got accepted to Yale and other colleges?
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.260]   I got it before.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.260]   Before.
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.260]   I see.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.460]   So they say, if you get into college, we will help pay this amount.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.500]   And then during your application to college, do you say, I got this scholarship?
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.420]   Because I would think that that would look pretty good too.
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.420]   That was part of the, I think it was all happening at the same time.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.900]   It was all in senior year.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.780]   And so I remember when I was doing the final interview, I had to do several interviews
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.380]   for the New York Times scholarship program.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.220]   And when I got it, I had not yet been accepted to college.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.420]   I think the acceptance was starting to roll in a little bit later.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:27.380]   But I'm a big believer in, I remember, I went out and got a book from my school library
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.820]   that was all about private scholarships, academic scholarships.
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.380]   And I just went and was doing research during all the free time that I had.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.620]   So during my lunch period, after school, I was just in the library researching scholarships
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620]   and applying for everything.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.260]   And I ended up getting six or seven of these private scholarships, but I must have applied
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.260]   for like 100.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.940]   So you were very intentional.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.980]   So this is really important for listeners and parents is that you have to be intentional
[00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.980]   if you want to get the scholarship.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.860]   It's not just going to fall in your lap most of the time.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.020]   You've got to apply, you've got to research, see what's most relevant.
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.940]   It's kind of like applying to college, but for scholarships, it is kind of like a full-time
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.940]   job.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.940]   Absolutely.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.060]   And the great thing is that a lot of my, I had sort of like a bunch of essays that I
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.060]   used to apply to different colleges.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.260]   And I could also take them and then make tweaks to them to apply for these scholarship programs
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.580]   because they were personal essays.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.580]   So you apply to college and when you apply to a lot of scholarship programs, they want
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.580]   a personal essay.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.380]   So you just can take it and tweak it for a college or for a scholarship.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   But you have to be very dedicated and definitely putting your research.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.060]   But the good thing is that there are just many, many scholarships out there.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.660]   And so many of them that a lot of people don't know they're out there and you might apply.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.860]   A lot of people apply for the big ones, but then they overlook the ones that are like
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.220]   $5,000, $10,000, $7,000, $2,500 that are only getting a few applicants.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.220]   Right.
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:03.380]   So 20 years at the New York Times, I'd love to ask you about that experience and what
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:09.740]   listeners and readers get wrong about the media.
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.660]   Because since 2016, I remember Trump was talking about fake news and all that.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.820]   And I feel like there was like a big rift in society once he became president.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.540]   There was a lot of talk about the media and whether we should believe them or not.
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.780]   What are some misconceptions readers and listeners have about the media that you can kind of
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.700]   break down and clarify?
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.020]   So I think that the media has been under attack, obviously, in recent years.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.620]   And I think some of that is due to demagoguery.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:45.820]   I mean, I think that there are a lot of politicians who don't want to be held to account.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:54.620]   And so, you know, rather, you know, when the media is reporting on politicians and on institutions
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:06.220]   that may be involved in corruption or potentially, you know, telling lies, one way to, you know,
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:14.540]   to sort of counter that is to undermine, you know, the media that is trying to expose corruption
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.260]   among institutions, for example.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.900]   And you know, that's not to say that the media is perfect.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:27.780]   You know, obviously, as reporters and as journalists, you know, we make mistakes, but your obligation
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.980]   as a reporter is if you make a mistake, if you report something that's inaccurate, then
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.220]   you run a correction, you know, correct the record.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.580]   So the media is not obviously perfect.
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.580]   You know, we do make mistakes.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.180]   I occasionally, you know, publish things that I get wrong, and then we have to run a correction,
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.120]   you know, the next day we have to.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.820]   That's our obligation to our readers and to the public.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:55.740]   I think another misapprehension is, you know, people have a very conspiratorial perspective
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.740]   of media.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:03.500]   They think that, you know, a lot of journalists, that all journalists have an agenda or that
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.060]   are, you know, that if you work for The Washington Post, you work for The New York Times, then
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.940]   your editor tells you what to do, tells you what to write, and you're just a sort of puppet.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:12.940]   And that's not the case.
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.380]   A lot of reporters, you know, we are just people doing a job like anyone else, you know,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.780]   and our goal by and large is to just seek out the truth and report on the truth.
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:32.700]   You know, and we are people who, you know, most of us have a lot of integrity and just
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.740]   want to inform the public and hold, you know, speak truth to power.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.740]   Right.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.700]   No, I hear you.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.700]   It's a good point on if you're going, if you're trying to uncover the truth about someone
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:52.060]   who might have done something wrong, it seems logical to try to attack the institution that's
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.060]   trying to go after you.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.180]   I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:03.140]   In terms of the editor and journalist relationship, who decides the title of the article?
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.940]   And does the journalist, the writer, actually have a say in what that title will be?
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.540]   Because there sometimes is a mismatch.
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.660]   Absolutely.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.780]   And that is something that is, I would say, a lot of journalists, something we have to
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:24.180]   deal with that can be a bit of a nuisance at times is that if you work for a big news
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:32.820]   organization, especially a print organization or a large digital news operation or TV operation,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.860]   you typically do not write the headlines on your story.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.520]   So what you do is you, you know, I have an assignment editor who I talk to pretty regularly
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.500]   and I tell her, you know, what I think is going to be a story.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.900]   I tell her what news I'm pursuing, what stories I'm working on.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.140]   You know, she gives me feedback.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.060]   We talk about what the story is going to be, what I'm finding or what I'm going to go out
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.060]   and report on.
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.580]   Then I write the story and then I file it to her.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.860]   She edits it, asks me questions, you know, tries to see if there's any inaccuracies or
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.480]   anything like that or make sure everything is clear, does her editing, and then she writes
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.820]   the headline.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.380]   Or a copy editor, who is a second editor, will write the headline.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.180]   And back in the day when I first started, a lot of times I wouldn't even see the headline
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.500]   before I went into print.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.300]   So sometimes, occasionally, I would see a story in print and I would see the headline
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.940]   and think, "Yeah, I don't really agree with that headline.
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.500]   I don't think it really sums it up."
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.460]   Maybe it's too suggestive.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:38.580]   And a lot of times I would get emails from people who just read the headline and didn't
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.060]   read the actual story.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.060]   Right.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060]   I mean, that's very common.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.980]   And then wrote to me complaining that, you know, that my story was all wrong or that
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.980]   I don't know what I was talking about.
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.900]   Or I was like, "I didn't write the headline."
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.140]   And if you read the story, like that's, you know, the headline is five words and the story
[00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.940]   is like, you know, a thousand words.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.940]   Right.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.980]   Where I go into the nuances and the details and give, you know, it's very balanced and
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.540]   I'm interviewing one side, then the other side, or describing a study and it's, I discuss
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.660]   all the details and nuances.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.660]   And it's very difficult.
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:15.700]   You know, I don't blame the editors who occasionally misinterpret a story and maybe don't put the
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.340]   best headline on it because you're trying to sum up a, you know, a thousand word story
[00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.100]   or 2000 word story in five words.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.280]   And it's extremely difficult to be that concise.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.380]   And also you want it to be compelling so that people see it all and think, "Oh, this is
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   an interesting story.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.380]   Let me read through the rest."
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.180]   But we live in this, you know, this environment nowadays or this media culture where, you
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.100]   know, we're just deluged with headlines and we have our iPhones and you're constantly
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.460]   getting news updates and news alerts.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.100]   And I, you know, I listen to lots of podcasts, yours included and many others.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.860]   And there's just so much media to consume that a lot of times it's hard to sit there
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.580]   and read a full article because we have short attention spans.
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.680]   So oftentimes the reporters don't usually write the headlines, unless it's a blog that's
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.660]   run by like, you know, one or two people.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.420]   But most large news organizations, you have editors who write the headlines.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.420]   Got it.
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.780]   So a lesson learned, folks, is to look at the headline.
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.780]   Maybe it'll catch your attention.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.260]   I think that's part of the big reason why there are catchy headlines.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:21.700]   But to spend time reading and delving into the content of the articles, I have the same
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.660]   problem with Financial Samurai as well.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.760]   I write probably too long articles, like 2,500-word articles and it loses people.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.820]   But it's just me trying to be balanced and, you know, I got to be more concise.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.020]   I don't have the luxury of having a nice editor.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.000]   But I also have to figure out what is a proper headline as well.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.060]   So just spend some time digging deep because chances are if you read one more paragraph,
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.980]   you might find a more balanced perspective and the answers to your questions.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.060]   And I will also say that, you know, journalists, we're just people.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.660]   You know, we write stories we want people to read and we want to engage with the public.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.180]   And so occasionally I'll get an email from someone who maybe just read the headline,
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.700]   you know, and got really upset and sent me an email calling me an idiot or something
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   and just sent me a nasty email.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.860]   And I'm like, "Okay, well, I'm not going to respond to that person."
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.300]   But then there are people who write to me, who send messages that are like, "Oh, great
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.420]   story," or, you know, "Hey, you know, I read your story.
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.660]   I thought the headline didn't quite get it right, blah, blah, blah," and they're civil.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.660]   And then I respond.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.860]   You know, if someone sends a civil message to me, even if they disagree with something
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.780]   I wrote, if they're civil, then you'll get a response.
[00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:34.180]   And, you know, I've often – I've had long correspondences with people, with readers
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.900]   who maybe didn't agree with everything, but they sent me a civil message and we ended
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.300]   up having a great dialogue.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.620]   You know, and we have a discussion and it's great.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.820]   And I do the same.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.220]   You know, occasionally I read something in other news outlets that I disagree with and
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.700]   maybe I'll write to that person and just be civil and you will get, you know, a response
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.700]   and feedback and perhaps start a dialogue that way.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.300]   Mad Fientist So given you're a health reporter, things
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.500]   must have been crazy wild for you once the pandemic began.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.900]   Because I remember in 2020, I would see a lot of stories, unfortunately negative stories,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.100]   about people who died from COVID complications.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:20.180]   And one of the most consistent variables that I noticed were that these folks had comorbidities
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.100]   or were overweight.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.620]   And so that kind of scared me into trying to – thinking about my fitness more, about
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.140]   trying to eat better and protect my mental health and all that.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.620]   How was COVID like for you as a health reporter?
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.660]   And why – do you feel the nation got healthier during this time as a silver lining because
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:45.060]   we were so scared of this potential virus that could have negatively affected our health?
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.500]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yes.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.040]   So I think that that's a – you raise a great point.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.100]   We did see, if you look at the data, that there were a lot of people who got healthier
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.140]   who decided, you know, I want to – I'm seeing all these people die and they have
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.940]   these comorbidities, you know, the leading comorbidities for, you know, risk of death
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:09.520]   from COVID or hypertension, diabetes, obesity, you know, heart disease.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.740]   So a lot of people saw that and thought, you know, I want to get healthier.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.100]   And a lot of us started working from home and so you had the ability to cook your own
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.100]   food.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.340]   You had the ability to maybe go out, spend a little more time exercising because you
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.880]   weren't commuting in the morning and afternoon.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:29.600]   But I will say importantly, and I'm still trying to track down all the data on this,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.560]   but I think there's a class divide when it comes to that.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.640]   I think that the people of higher socioeconomic status could, you know, work from home during
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:45.000]   lockdown and who, you know, could afford to go on Amazon and buy, you know, workout equipment
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.720]   and set up a gym in your garage or in your backyard.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   Dr. Abdul Latifov: Yeah, those $3,000 Peloton bikes.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.240]   That was crazy.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.240]   Like, are you kidding me?
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.240]   I can't afford that.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   So expensive.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   Now you can get them for like $500, I think.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   Yeah, that's another story.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:04.160]   You know, I went online and I bought, you know, gym equipment from my garage during
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:08.640]   COVID because I couldn't go to the gym and, you know, I started cooking more from home.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   But I think the people who have higher socioeconomic status were the ones who maybe were more likely
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.920]   to get healthier during the pandemic.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.440]   And then people who, you know, are more working class, it was harder for them.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   You know, you maybe maybe you lost your job, maybe you had to get two jobs.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.200]   I mean, I think those are the people where it was more of a struggle.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.160]   I think COVID might have exacerbated the class division.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.240]   But that's just my sort of my educated guess, I would say.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.520]   Dr. Abdul Latifov I see.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.800]   Yeah, one of the blind spots that I had before having children was being a little bit judgmental
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.400]   to the families that brought their kids to McDonald's to eat all the hamburgers and Big
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.920]   Macs and I was like, that's not good for you.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.960]   But now that I have children, three and a half and six, I understand why not only from
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.640]   a cost perspective, but from a let's load up our children with some calories so they
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.680]   don't starve because they're such picky eaters.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.360]   You know, you have to have a balance between are you going to eat this?
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   Are you going to starve?
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.640]   It's kind of like a dichotomy that and I'm like, okay, well, the cheeseburger you want
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.200]   cheeseburger, okay, just not too much.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   But here's the cheeseburger.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.320]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, 100%.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.440]   I have two children and my son Parker was four and then my daughter Isabella who is
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440]   one and a half.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.360]   And yeah, there are all these there are all these funny memes that I see online occasionally
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.720]   that I agree with where it's like, you know, someone before, you know, they have kids,
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.440]   they're organic, you know, cage free, no sugar till they're five, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.840]   And then, you know, after you have kids, the parents is like, okay, if they can just take
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.560]   one bite of this cheeseburger, then we'll be okay because it's not only like getting,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.280]   you know, the calories into a kid who's a picky eater, but I don't know if you have
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   this issue.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.720]   But you know, my son, if he skips his lunch and he does, he hasn't eaten, you know, he
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   gets hangover.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   Dave Asprey Yeah, hangover, grouchy.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.320]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani It ruins his whole afternoon if he hasn't had food and then you
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:12.160]   get, you know, some chicken nuggets or something in him and he's like, totally, you know, different
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   kid.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.720]   So yeah, you know, you're like, oh, you know, if we can just get get him to eat this slice
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.320]   of pizza, hey, you know, it's got tomatoes, that's a vegetable.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.920]   You know, we try very hard to give him nutritious food.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.360]   But it's difficult when you have kids, you know, sometimes you just have to let go and
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.040]   be like, okay, you know, they want to have pizza for dinner.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   That's fine.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.400]   You know, or, you know, he wants to have a cookie, like, okay, you got to pick your battles,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   right?
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   Dave Asprey Right.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.680]   So over the coming 12 months or 24 months, in terms of health, is there is there some
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.800]   specific issue of health that you're trying to pursue and elucidate to the readership
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.360]   at the Washington Post?
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.240]   What is something that's driving you the most?
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.600]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yes.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.980]   So I will say that during the pandemic, you know, I was working for the New York Times
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.920]   and then the Washington Post decided to launch what's called the Wellbeing Desk because it
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.240]   saw a lot of people were interested in wellness.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.280]   And that wellness was, you know, obviously playing such a big role in the pandemic.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.400]   Because as you said, people with comorbidities were at a higher risk of having severe or
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   fatal COVID.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.960]   So the Washington Post launched this new Wellbeing Desk and brought me on as a columnist to write
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   about nutrition.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.960]   And I've been very focused, you know, I joined last year, and I've been very focused on writing
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.680]   about the quality of our food and the role it plays in health outcomes.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.880]   And one thing I'm one thing I've focused on a lot is ultra processed foods, which are,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   you know, these foods that are, you know, highly processed, they're typically very low
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   in fiber, they have a lot of additives, things like sugar, salt, artificial colors, flavorings,
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.880]   preservatives.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.480]   There's been a lot of research lately around the world, showing that the more ultra processed
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.160]   foods you consume on a daily basis, the higher your risk of these comorbidities we talked
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.760]   about from heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, to, you know, cancer, and even cognitive decline
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.960]   and dementia.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.760]   So I've been writing about ultra processed foods, and I'm doing a project now, sort of
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.440]   digging into what it is about these foods that seem to cause do a lot of damage to our
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   to our health.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.560]   And I will say that, you know, this is another issue where there's a class divide, because
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.280]   people of lower socioeconomic status tend to eat higher amounts of these foods.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.760]   Because for a lot of reasons, they tend to be very cheap.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.560]   So they're very, you know, economical.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.800]   They're long lasting, because they're highly processed, the fiber is removed, you know,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.600]   they're shelf stable things like breakfast cereals that have a lot of sugar added to
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.600]   them.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.760]   You know, things like frozen pizzas, frozen entrees, you know, chicken nuggets.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.600]   You know, these are things, you know, canned foods that have a lot of salt and preservatives
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   added to them.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.720]   These are things that won't go off in a couple days.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.640]   Things like fresh fruits and vegetables are very good for your health, but they go off
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   or fresh meat, fresh seafood, you know, these things tend to go off pretty quickly.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.800]   So people who are, you know, maybe lower income working class, they need foods that are going
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.400]   to be shelf stable, that are inexpensive, that are easy, that are tasty, that their
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.680]   kids will eat.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.760]   And so they tend to eat, you know, the highest levels of these foods, but also have the worst
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.440]   health outcomes.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.160]   So that's something I'm reporting on now.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.960]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Well, that'd be great if you can help report on that and also find
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.640]   some solutions because in my mind, it's very simple.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:45.360]   And it's probably not easy is to cut out the refined sugars and processed foods.
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.600]   But then like you say, the shelf life, the expense of that, and I just think about it
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.000]   for my kids now, like, how much is too much.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.120]   So this is definitely an issue that I hope we can be more aware of because there's this
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.800]   whole school of thought about, well, healthcare costs are so expensive per capita.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.640]   Why don't we focus more on preventative healthcare because we all want to live healthier and
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   longer.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.560]   So I think you reporting on that is gonna be great, because hopefully, it'll make people
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.040]   more aware about the food that they consume.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.360]   Dr. Scott Zuckerman Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.920]   There's so many issues tied up in it.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.840]   It's you know, how it's impacting our health, but then you know, that is very costly to
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.380]   the economy because it costs the federal government and insurance companies billions and billions
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:34.260]   of dollars a year to you know, pay for these medical conditions that are also the leading
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:40.200]   killers of Americans, you know, the leading causes of death are preventable diseases that
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.920]   are in many cases, diet related diseases, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   hypertension.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:55.080]   So it's what it's shortening our lifespans, and also increasing the costs to the government
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.400]   and the health insurance system hurting our pockets.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.720]   Yeah, it's right, really wide ranging effects.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Right.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.360]   I know you've got to go soon.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.480]   So I just have a last question.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:10.120]   And I'm just curious to know about your views on the relationship between journalists and
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   bloggers.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.680]   Because for me as a blogger, I can write about whatever I want, there's kind of no real consequences.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.000]   I got to I can come up the wackiest title and say the most inane things.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.640]   And if it's to try to get clicks, well, I guess I can do that.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.120]   But I'm just trying to be thoughtful about stuff I write.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.480]   And then for you as a journalist, you know, you have strict rules of engagement, you've
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.440]   got an editor, how do you see that relationship?
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.720]   And do you ever say, Oh, I would like to actually just do my own thing on my site.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.160]   I'm just curious to know your thoughts and perspectives.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.640]   Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, I think it's, it's tricky for journalists
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.040]   because for someone who works for a large news organization like the Washington Post,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.680]   because as you said, you know, we have, I have freedom to pursue, generally speaking,
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.920]   the stories I want to do.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.160]   But you know, I have an editor who I go to and I say, Hey, this is what I'm thinking
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   of doing.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.520]   And we kind of work together on that.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.840]   And you know, so there's some limitations, you know, I have someone who, you know, can
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.000]   push back against me, whereas you have complete autonomy.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.760]   I love the autonomy.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   It's much more difficult.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.680]   But then, you know, you know, so I love financial samurai.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's a thankful blog.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.480]   I've been reading it for many years.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.160]   You do great work.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.520]   You know, and I think there are so many blogs out there that do such a great job, especially
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.160]   covering like really niche areas.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.640]   But you know, it's it's I think it's harder as as a blogger, because you don't necessarily
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.160]   have not you specifically, but you know, some bloggers, you don't necessarily have that
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   security, right?
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160]   Like, no, there's no security.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.280]   Yeah, there's a nine to five I have insurance, you know, I have, you went straight to the
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280]   top.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.560]   So I mean, yeah, you have the you work that the most one of the most prestigious platforms
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.120]   and a huge platform.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.960]   Whereas for bloggers, we got to like, scrape and crawl and go through the mud to try to
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.360]   build something of our own.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.080]   And it takes can take years.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.440]   I mean, it's been over 14 years now with financial samurai.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   And then you have to go out and find, you know, advertisers.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.320]   And you know, if you take a day off, like, you know, you it's it's your operation, you're
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.680]   essentially self employed business owner.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.600]   Whereas for me, if I take a week off, you know, there's 500 other reporters who are
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.520]   going to be stories in the Washington Post, right?
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.360]   There's trade offs.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   Sure.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   Say, yeah.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:34.840]   I mean, I'm not a blogger, but but yeah, there are, I guess, you know, there's pluses and
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   minuses.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.000]   Well, here's an interesting perspective.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.480]   So I don't think I'd ever be able to get a job at the New York Times or the Washington
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   Post.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.720]   I'm just not qualified, even though I've written 2500 articles, and I've built my own brand.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.080]   But you have the ability to start your own blog or website and talk about whatever you
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   want.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.040]   So it's something for listeners to think about, as you go on your path and do something, you
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.360]   know, there's there's the route.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.080]   I joined Goldman Sachs out of college.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:09.160]   So that helped boom, in inject me into this institution that had some good prestige and
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.280]   reputation at the time, at least.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   And then I could do something else.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.720]   So there's two ways to go about things, folks, you can build it on your own the hard way.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.120]   But I think I think it's strategically better to join an organization, learn as much as
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.680]   possible build those skills.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   And once you have that financial buffer and confidence to go out on your own if you want
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560]   to.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.480]   I would say, though, that I wouldn't rule it out completely for you, because you have
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.400]   such an extensive background in writing about personal finance.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:43.000]   I could see a news organization hiring you as a personal finance columnist, you know,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.840]   someone who's giving his own opinions on personal finance.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:54.440]   It would be more it'd be more difficult to, you know, to write to be a straight news reporter
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.200]   writing about the economy or finance or covering Goldman Sachs.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.080]   But there are a lot of personal finance columnists.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.480]   I guess I guess you're right.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:09.280]   And I can think of one person when I was at the Times, Brian Stelter, who was at he actually
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.000]   started out as a blogger covering the TV news industry.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.880]   I think his blog was called TV Newser, I want to say, breaking so many stories on his blog.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.800]   He was eventually hired by the New York Times.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.480]   Oh, he went on to CNN.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.360]   And the show Reliable Sources.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.200]   He eventually left CNN last year.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.960]   But now he's back out there.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.400]   I see writing articles for different news organizations, but he started as a as a blogger.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.400]   Interesting.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.480]   Well, I like to count myself out.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.540]   And part of the reason I like to count myself out is so that I don't have these options
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.720]   to go do something else because I want to stay independent and just do my own thing.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.880]   It'd be harder for you to go from having all that autonomy and freedom.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.680]   It's being inside a news organization where you have an editor saying, "No, I don't like
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   that idea."
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   Yeah, that would piss me off.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.240]   I would really push back.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.560]   I'm like, "No, no, no, I'm the boss.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   I'm the captain now."
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.960]   Yeah, and you turn in a blog that's 25 or a piece that's 2,500, 3,000 words and your
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.600]   editor is like, "Okay, we got to cut this down to 800 words."
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   Yeah, you're like, "What?
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.040]   No, no, I totally hear you."
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   All right.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.040]   Well, it's been great talking to you.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.880]   Anahad, if listeners want to read more about your work and also your guest hosting the
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.200]   podcast, please share where they can find you.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:34.960]   Yeah, so you can go to WashingtonPost.com/WellBeing, which is the homepage for the WellBeing Desk
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:41.040]   at the Washington Post where you can find my columns on nutrition and news articles
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.440]   and columns by my other great colleagues on the Washington Post WellBeing Desk.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.640]   You can find me on Twitter @AnahadO'Connor.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.200]   That's A-N-A-H-A-D-O-C-O-N-N-O-R.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.000]   Yeah, those are usually the two best places to find me.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.680]   Awesome, and I'll put it in the show notes so it's easy for people to find.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   All right.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.960]   Well, thanks for connecting.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.120]   Maybe we'll connect again when you get some more time.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   Let's do it.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.120]   I would love to.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   Great to talk to you.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:08.320]   You too.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.000]   (gulps)
