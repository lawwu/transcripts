[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.840]   found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the third chapter and the 16th
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.520]   verse. The 16th verse in the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.480]   Ephesians, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man. Let me again read to
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.920]   you this entire section from verse 14 to the end of the chapter. For this cause I
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.040]   heaven and earth is named that he would grant you according to the riches of his
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.960]   glory to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man that Christ
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.360]   may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.760]   be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.080]   depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that he
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.600]   might be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able to do
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.480]   exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.760]   worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   ages world without end amen but we are concerned particularly this morning again
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.360]   with the statement in this 16th verse here we saw last Sunday morning the
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.800]   Apostle begins to tell these Ephesians what exactly was the nature of his
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.080]   prayer for them we've seen the importance he attaches to praying in the
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   right way you bow your knees when you go to God not of necessity physically but
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.040]   in spirit we approach him with reverence and with godly fear assurance in prayer
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.880]   does not mean glibness it doesn't mean aggressiveness it doesn't mean cock
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.320]   sureness no it is characterized still by reverence and godly fear boldness is ever
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.760]   accompanied by humility when it is a true spiritual and Christian boldness
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.440]   and then he tells us what it is he prays for them and this is the first thing
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.240]   that God might grant unto them according to the riches of his glory to be
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.560]   strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner men in other words you see it's
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.320]   a spiritual prayer he doesn't pray anything about their material position
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.720]   or his own this we saw was the grand strategy of the Christian life the
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.680]   Christian way of dealing with difficulties is not so much to look at
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.480]   them or to do anything about them directly it is to build up this inner
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.440]   man that's how the Christian overcomes and is made more than conqueror he's not
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.360]   so much concerned about the infection as about his resistance you remember we
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.560]   showed you the analogy in the physical realm and in the material realm that is
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.440]   the best way of treating all diseases or of countering diseases and infections
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.320]   build up your own resistance all this modern emphasis upon vitamins and so on
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.280]   is just indicative of that we need to keep ourselves in a fit state and as we
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.200]   are fit we can resist the various forces that are ever threatening to attack us
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.520]   and to make us sick now that is the kind of strategy that the apostle here
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.200]   announces you see in his prayer with regard to the spiritual conflict in
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.960]   which we find ourselves it's spiritual and it is specific and it all turns upon
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.800]   this remarkable doctrine concerning the inner man and we indicated you remember
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.520]   that this inner man is the thing that differentiates the Christian from the
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.240]   non-christian the tragedy of the non-christian is that he hasn't got an
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.480]   inner man his life is entirely on the surface and therefore he's entirely
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.960]   influenced by the things that happened around and about him he doesn't know of
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.160]   some inner citadel of the soul into which he can retire he can't say with
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   the great apostle in the fourth chapter of 2nd Corinthians you remember though
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.240]   our outward men perish yet the inward men is renewed day by day he knows
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.160]   nothing about that that is the final tragedy of not being a Christian his
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.240]   life is entirely superficial so that when he's taken ill or things go wrong
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:24.040]   he has nothing to fall back upon his world collapses he is lost but the
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.800]   Christian has this inner man and the whole art of living the Christian life
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.480]   is the art of knowing that we have an inner man and the knowledge of how this
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.720]   inner man can be strengthened and made powerful so the Apostle you see is
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.040]   praying about death and therefore we last time indicated something of the
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.640]   nature of this inner man here is the mind if you like and the heart and the
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.640]   will of the new men in Christ Jesus he's the regenerate men and those are the
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.280]   qualities that he manifests very well now it's important that we start by
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.560]   realizing all that if we don't realize that well there's no point in going any
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.000]   further we have to start by knowing what this inner man represents what it means
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.320]   and further we must be certain that we have an inner man we must be able to
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.920]   talk to ourselves as it were we must be able to address this inner man and that
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.200]   is I think one of the best definitions of the Christian the Christian is a man
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.240]   who can talk to himself you know the natural man rarely can't do that he is
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.240]   incapable of it because he hasn't got an inner man but the Christian is a man
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.840]   who's able to talk to himself about himself and about whatever may be
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.640]   happening to him we must know that we have an inner man if we haven't an inner
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.400]   man well as I say I don't see that we are Christians at all very well but that
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:15.760]   isn't enough the apostle you see prays that this inner man may be strengthened
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:23.320]   with might by the Holy Spirit and here again we come across a very big and a
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.960]   very vital principle in the Christian life this prayer you see is offered for
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:36.000]   those who are already Christian he is praying here for people whom he's been
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.560]   describing in the first and the second chapters and he said some very
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.000]   remarkable things about them there here here's the sort of thing he has said in
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of salvation
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.640]   of your salvation in whom also after that he believed he were sealed with
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.120]   that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.200]   redemption of the purchase possession these people were already believers
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.640]   they'd already had remarkable experiences as we have seen not only that
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.480]   the apostle has already offered a great prayer for them in their first chapter
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.280]   he says that he ceases not to give thanks for them making mention of them
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.000]   in his prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.280]   give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.220]   and then he has displayed this knowledge and we've been dealing with it at the
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.280]   end of chapter 1 and the whole of chapter 2 but still you see he's not
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.160]   satisfied still he goes on praying and he lets them know that though he's
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.880]   imprisoned and doesn't see them and is far away from them he's bowing his knees
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.520]   he is praying in the presence of God he's looking into God's face on their
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:05.400]   behalf and he is praying that this inner man of theirs may be strengthened with
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:14.080]   might by the Spirit of God we must never I say lose sight of this fact that this
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:22.320]   is a prayer for Christians why well this is the important point because the
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   experience of forgiveness and of salvation is merely the beginning of the
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.240]   Christian life and we haven't arrived when we've experienced that that's
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.360]   merely the beginning it's merely the first step that is simply to say that
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.200]   you've entered into the kingdom but that is only the very merest beginning of it
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.800]   all and the tragedy is that there are so many Christian people who stop at that
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.920]   they're only concerned about their personal security and safety they're
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.920]   simply concerned about being in the kingdom of God at all they simply want
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.480]   to know that their sins are forgiven that they won't go to hell and that they
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.360]   have a prospect of going to heaven and the moment they've had this initial
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.280]   experience they seem to rest upon it they never grow you never see any
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.880]   difference in them if you see them 50 years later they're exactly where they
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.480]   were they think they've got everything and there has been no indication
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.920]   whatsoever of any development but you see that is very far removed indeed from
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   what we find here about the Christian there are great and glorious
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.760]   possibilities for the Christian here is one of them immediately that Christ may
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.600]   dwell in your hearts by faith that they may come to know something about God's
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:57.200]   love in its breadth and length and depth and height indeed that they might be
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:06.280]   filled with all the fullness of God now that's possible for the Christian and
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:15.320]   let me underline this it is possible for all Christians the apostle isn't here
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.040]   writing a circular letter to apostles he isn't concerned here only with some
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.960]   very exceptional persons he is writing to the ordinary church members of the
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   church at Ephesus we don't know their names we know nothing at all about them
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.360]   these are people whom we describe if there is such a term as ordinary
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.200]   Christians yet it is for these he's praying and he prays that they may know
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.640]   all these things leading to the tremendous almost incredible climax that
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.920]   he may be filled with all the fullness of God well now that this is not only a
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.520]   possibility for all Christians it is the duty of all Christians to be in this
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:10.320]   position now let me tell you something give you a word which was once uttered
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:17.960]   by the great Charles Haddon Spurgeon this is how mr. Spurgeon once put this
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:28.280]   point he said there is a point in grace as much above the ordinary Christian as
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.520]   the ordinary Christian is above the worldly let me repeat that it's so
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   important there is a point in grace in other words there is a point in the
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.800]   Christian life in the development of the Christian which is as much above the
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.640]   ordinary Christian as the ordinary Christian is above the worldly now
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.920]   that's a very striking and a very strong way of putting it but it's absolutely
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.760]   right we all know the difference in level between the non-christian and the
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.640]   Christian the Christian is here the non-christian is down there a difference
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:17.520]   of level yes but mr. Spurgeon reminds us that there is this other position in the
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.720]   Christian life which is as much above this ordinary Christian level as this
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:30.800]   was above that and of course one must accept it if we are rarely believe that
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:38.960]   Christ can dwell in our hearts that we can know this love of God and of Christ
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:47.160]   in all its dimensions that we may be filled with all the fullness of God I
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.560]   think we'll agree at once that that is as much above the ordinary Christian
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:59.480]   level as that level is above the non-christian so I ask my obvious
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:11.400]   question are we in this point to which mr. Spurgeon refers do we conform to
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.440]   this description that the Apostle here gives of what is possible to the
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:25.680]   Christian is Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith have we looked into this
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:33.160]   great eternal cube of God's eternal love have we been staggered as we've looked
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:41.040]   at these dimensions do we know what is meant by being filled with all the
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.720]   fullness of God the God who is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:56.200]   that we can ask or think now then here is the great question are we there have
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.840]   we reached that level that height are we dwelling there or are we down here on
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:06.160]   the ordinary Christian level very well having answered that question we
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.320]   obviously must go on to this question if we feel we are just on this ordinary
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   level what I take it we all want to know is how can we get to this other level
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.360]   and there is only one answer to that question and that is the answer given by
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:29.400]   the Apostles prayer we must be strengthened with might by the Spirit in
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.520]   the inner man now then why does this inner man of ours need to be
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:43.840]   strengthened there are certain obvious answers to that question and they're
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.000]   very important because if we don't realize this we shall never realize the
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.280]   need of being strengthened there is this fatal danger I say of saying I've been
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.840]   converted I rest upon my oars I just now become an active worker I rush into
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.800]   activities and you find people doing that and as I say after 50 years you
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.040]   find them exactly where they were at the beginning they've never realized that
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.280]   anything more was possible they think they've got everything they're
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.480]   Christians they've never realized the need of the inner man being strengthened
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.840]   why does he need to be strengthened the first answer is that because at first
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:29.400]   he's only a babe that's the New Testament term isn't it I could not
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:37.000]   speak unto you as unto spiritual says Paul but as unto carnal as unto babes in
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.520]   Christ that's the scriptural teaching that we are born and we are born as babes
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.160]   and the baby's only starting to live he hasn't developed fully he hasn't arrived
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:56.640]   and he is one who needs to be strengthened he is weak he is ignorant
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   he's innocent of many things in the world that is round and about him and he
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:11.440]   hasn't an immunity against the things that are liable to attack him that is
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   the characteristic of babyhood isn't it or of infancy always that's why the
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.800]   child has to be protected always by the parents obviously he doesn't know he
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.560]   doesn't understand he takes everybody at their face value he takes the world as
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.760]   it is and he thinks it's marvelous he doesn't know of its ugliness and the
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.440]   foul things that are in it it's only as we grow we begin to understand these
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.880]   things don't misunderstand me I'm not saying that that baby's without sin or
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   that he's innocent I don't agree with Wordsworth's talk about this kind of
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.440]   immortality that is there and this perfection and then that the shades of
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.720]   the prison house begin to close upon the growing boy I'm not saying that but I'm
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:18:00.920]   saying this that a child because of his ignorance isn't aware of the dangers and
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:08.600]   therefore needs to be protected and that is true of the new man in Christ Jesus
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   doesn't matter how old the man is when he's converted he's a babe in Christ he
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.040]   feels at first everything is solved I'll never have another difficulty and often
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.160]   the evangelists are responsible for his thinking that they give him that
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.200]   impression and here he is in his utter innocence there's never going to be
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.680]   another cloud in the whole of his life but alas the clouds come difficulties
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:38.040]   arise problems come across his path and he's bewildered and often he falls he
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.840]   may even slide back he becomes a backslider it's because he was a babe
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.080]   and because he didn't know the babe needs to be strengthened so you see it
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.720]   is that the Apostle John in his first epistle talks about little children
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:59.240]   young men fathers there are these gradations in the Christian life there
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:07.720]   is this process of growth and of development but a second reason for the
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:18.920]   need of this strengthening is this the devil the adversary the accuser of the
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:27.320]   brethren and all the men who hasn't yet realized that he is confronted with this
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:33.120]   power is the merest tyro in the Christian life listen to this apostle
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.760]   saying it in the last chapter of this very epistle we wrestle not against
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:45.480]   flesh and blood that's not our problem the problem is not simply that we have a
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.200]   certain struggle against our own flesh and blood that the body that we are in
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.680]   there are problems there it isn't merely other men the whole problem he says is
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:01.600]   the principalities and powers the rulers of the darkness of this world the
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.200]   spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places and it's because of this that
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.840]   the inner man needs to be strengthened because this power is not only great in
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:23.640]   might it is great in subtlety and great in cunning this same apostle tells the
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.160]   Corinthians in the second chap in the second epistle chapter 12 that this
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:35.960]   enemy is so powerful that he's able to transform himself into an angel of light
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.000]   he can come and quote scripture he can reason with you he can put up arguments
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.480]   and cases and he can present you with a form of truth and it sounds perfectly
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.720]   all right and perfectly Christian but it's wrong and he leads you astray and
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.840]   you enter into snares and down you go now here is a very powerful reason for
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:05.560]   the need of strengthening with might by the spirit in the inner man because the
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:14.040]   devil always makes a very special target of this inner man and you know I've
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   often met people in trouble and in difficulties in their spiritual life
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.160]   because they hadn't realized that they seem to think that the only sins are the
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.760]   sins of the flesh they were watching against those and they'd got to a point
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   in which they didn't trouble them at all and thinking that that was the only line
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.080]   on which the devil can attack they were not aware of the fact that he with his
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.040]   great subtlety and thus as I say as an angel of light he makes his direct
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.920]   attack upon the inner man and insinuates his thoughts and ideas and his
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:52.280]   innuendos and suggestions and they were not aware at all of this and suddenly
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.680]   they find themselves unhappy and wretched and lost as it were and
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.240]   wondering whether they've ever been Christians at all what's happened oh it
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.520]   was that the devil with his subtlety had ignored the outer man altogether and had
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.640]   simply concentrated all his attention upon the inner man that is why you see
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:17.800]   that statement in the Old Testament is so true keep thy heart with all diligence
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:26.120]   for out of it are the issues of life the devil and then thirdly another reason
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:34.120]   for the need of strengthening of the inner man is this the very greatness of
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:40.240]   that which is offered to us and that which is possible to us here you see is
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:47.520]   the possibility that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith that we may know
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:56.320]   this love of God and that we may be filled with all the fullness of God now
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.160]   I say the very greatness of the thing that is offered to us demands that we be
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.880]   strengthened in order to receive it lest we might be shattered by it now this is
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.280]   a very important point so I'd like to put it to you in this form it's a point
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.800]   that is often misunderstood or it in a red people don't appreciate its
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:25.320]   significance let me give you an exemplar an illustration of what I regard as a
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.960]   complete failure to understand this point I'm going to read to you some
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.840]   words written by the saintly Bishop Henley Moodle he puts it like this and
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:46.440]   why do we need a supreme empowering just in order to receive our life and our
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.160]   light he says this is odd fancy saying that we need to be strengthened to
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:59.800]   receive Jesus Christ who is our life and our light he says does the hungry
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.720]   wanderer need power in order to eat the food without which he will soon sink
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:11.920]   does the bewildered mariner need power to welcome onto his deck the pilot who
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:19.760]   alone can steer him to the haven of his desire no no he says he doesn't the
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.520]   thing he says is monstrous now you notice his argument here he says is
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.240]   something that sounds all wrong to us Paul prays that we may be strengthened
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.680]   with might by his spirit in the inner man that we may receive Christ but he
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.600]   says Christ is our strength how do I need strength in order to take strength
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.320]   it sounds monstrous he says here's a man who's been wandering in a wilderness
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.920]   does he need strength to eat the food the food that is going to give him
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:57.280]   strength or does that mariner that is lost as it were on the ocean in his ship
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.520]   does he need strength to receive the pilot who coming on board and knows the
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:07.920]   way and can direct him into his heaven no he says the thing is impossible so
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:16.000]   then he goes on to say that it must mean this that because of our sinful nature
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.360]   that is still in us there is a tendency within us to dread the power of Christ
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.560]   coming into us and to be afraid of it and to wonder what it might do to us now
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.800]   that is a perfectly true statement but I am rejecting it in total as an
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.120]   exposition of this particular verse he says that we need to be strengthened
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:46.080]   because left to ourselves we are afraid to receive Christ now it seems to me
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.400]   that there's a very definite fallacy there and the fallacy even in terms of
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.720]   his own illustrations he asks the question does a man that has been
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.560]   without food for long need strength in order to take that food which is going
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:08.600]   to give him strength he says no I venture to suggest with great respect
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.360]   that the answer may be yes in this way isn't it you've often read about people
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:20.320]   during the last war men who were torpedoed perhaps and who spent days and
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.640]   days on rafts or in boats upon the ocean or men who'd been in concentration camps
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.240]   and had been submitted to starvation they suddenly are given liberty they're
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   found by somebody and of course one's tendency is to put them down at a table
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.720]   and put a great square meal before well if you do that you may very well kill
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:48.200]   them if you give such a man a great meal of meat and vegetables and so on it may
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.000]   very well kill him why well because he isn't strong enough to take it before
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.920]   he is in a fit condition to take that strong meal you've got to regain his
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.940]   strength you may have to inject glucose into his veins into his blood you may
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.320]   have to give him various extracts you may have to then come on to a very
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.960]   lightly boiled egg which has got very little nutriment in it but just
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:16.360]   something something light it's not too much for him a man who's weak and
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.520]   exhausted he simply cannot take food it's a danger for him to do so so that
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:30.480]   you see in terms of his very argument it seems to me that that hurled position is
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.880]   quite wrong and certainly misses the spiritual intent of the Apostles prayer
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:43.800]   at this point no the thing that we are going to receive is so potent so mighty
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:51.000]   so strong that we need to be strengthened before we can receive it now
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.160]   let me give you another argument another analogy take what the author of the
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:03.360]   epistle to the Hebrews says in the fifth chapter of his epistle he says hitherto
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.320]   I have not fed you with strong meat he'd fed them only with milk why well he said
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:15.600]   you were not able to take it you are not strong enough to take it he says strong
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.800]   meat is for people who are adult who have grown and who developed if you give
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.360]   a little child this red meat this strong meat it'll give him acute indigestion it
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.240]   may cause him great sickness and illness again it may be the means of killing him
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:37.600]   you don't give strong meat to babes you give milk to babes strong meat is only
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:42.040]   appropriate to those whose senses have been exercised by use who've developed
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.720]   who are strong enough to take it indeed the Apostle Paul has said exactly the
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:52.400]   same and to the Corinthians in the first epistle he says how be it we speak
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.600]   wisdom amongst them that are perfect he said I didn't speak that wisdom to you
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.520]   you were yet carnal you were babes and I gave you the food that was appropriate
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.800]   to you but you need something to happen to you before you can receive this you
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:14.680]   need to be strengthened and of course all this is fully substantiated by what
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:22.800]   we can read in the experiences of many saints of God I've often reminded you of
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.840]   that experience that came to DL Moody as he was walking down Wall Street in New
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:38.640]   York City one afternoon suddenly the Holy Ghost came upon him he was baptized
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.600]   with the Holy Ghost and you remember what he tells us he says it was so
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.240]   tremendous it was so glorious that he really began to wonder whether he could
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.320]   stand it and in the end he cried out of God to hold his hand lest he should
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.800]   collapse on the street and later in his room what was it the transcendence of
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:08.200]   the glory when Christ enters the heart the glory is such the power is such that
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.160]   the very physical frame seems to collapse beneath it and the whole man is
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.360]   trembling and shaking you find the same thing in the experiences of people like
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:22.680]   Jonathan Edwards and David Brainard they've all testified to this you see
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.800]   when Christ comes and dwells in the heart by faith and when we are filled
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.720]   with the whole fullness of God you need to be strong to take it and to contain
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.000]   it it's a kind of shattering experience so the Apostle prays that they may be
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.760]   strengthened with might by the Spirit in the inner man oh there are many
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.160]   analogies that show this you can find it in the world of electricity and so on if
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.440]   you put some powerful electric force into a container well you've got to be
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.280]   very sure that the walls of the container are reinforced that they can
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.120]   stand it you wouldn't put that into a paper wall or into a wall made of wood
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.440]   you need something really powerful because of the energy the power that is
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:14.280]   there that's the thing the Apostle is praying for that we be strengthened with
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:24.160]   might by the Spirit in the inner man how then does this weakness of the inner man
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:31.080]   show itself let me point it out to you in detail the inner man I say needs to
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.640]   be strengthened because he's a babe because of that powerful enemy and
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.520]   because of this transcendent glory that is to come in how does the weakness show
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:48.480]   itself well like this take the mind first the mind in a spiritual sense
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:56.840]   needs to be strengthened because we are assailed by doubts some of the greatest
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.480]   saints have told us that they have been assailed by doubts at the end of their
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.120]   lives they haven't believed the doubts but the doubts have presented themselves
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:12.120]   and they have shaken them for a while doubts come that's a trouble in the
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.080]   mind and the mind needs to be strengthened against doubt then
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:22.800]   depression it's a very difficult thing to define that but you may wake up in
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.880]   the morning and find your mind in a depressed condition the mind that may
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.280]   have been working perfectly yesterday doesn't seem to be functioning today and
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.520]   there's a kind of dullness and slowness and inability about it the mind you see
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.160]   needs to be strengthened and the same way we are troubled perhaps by evil
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:46.000]   thoughts that come and attack the mind where do they come from they seem to be
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.400]   thrown at you Paul talks about the fiery darts of the wicked one thrown at us and
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.960]   he throws them into the mind when you wake up in the morning they stop before
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.360]   you've started thinking so the mind needs to be strengthened then another
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:08.760]   one wandering thoughts don't we all know about this you can read light literature
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.960]   or your newspaper and you have no difficulty in concentrating at all but
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.400]   then you try to read the Bible and your mind goes everywhere and you can't bring
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.480]   your mind back to it you're looking at words you're reading a verse but your
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.520]   minds over there wandering thoughts the difficulty about concentration upon the
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:32.560]   truth and then we need to be strengthened in the mind in this way
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:42.200]   while the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is in one sense gloriously simple
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.440]   there is another sense in which it is true to say that it is the profoundest
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:55.400]   truth in the world this epistle to the Ephesians is not simple you can't read
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.120]   this and run at the same time you can't gallop through this you can't sort of
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:05.640]   just walk through the epistle to the Ephesians no no there is profound truth
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.280]   here there is subtle argument there are immensities and infinities to quote
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:15.000]   Thomas Carlyle and you can't take these things that are run and people born
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.440]   again Christian people they come and read the epistle to the Ephesians I
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.240]   don't know what it's talking about what is this the mind needs to be strengthened
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.560]   you've got to apprehend truth and we cannot apprehend truth and realize what
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:35.680]   it means and what it's telling us unless our minds are strengthened now I know
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.320]   that there are many Christians who don't know that and they don't realize that
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:48.040]   at all and not only do they not know that they don't want to know that these
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.520]   are the Christians who say oh well of course I haven't got the time to read
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.680]   these things I'm a simple Christian I'm a plain man I can give my witness and my
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.720]   testimony I can do practical work but you know I really can't I haven't got
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.120]   the time I these things are too hard for me I can't grapple with them I'm not
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:08.160]   concerned about doctrine and things like that I'm a simple man and I believe in
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.920]   the simple gospel but my dear friend you have no right to speak like that and
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.560]   though you don't realize it and may say that you believe the Bible from cover to
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:25.960]   cover that the plain truth about you is that you don't if you are making no real
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.840]   effort to understand the epistle to the Ephesians or all this mighty word in
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:38.480]   this New Testament I say you're guilty of sin this was written to ordinary
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:43.080]   Christians we are all meant to understand these things and we have no
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   right to contract out of it and say I want a simple message a plain gospel I
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.160]   can't be bothered it means too much of an effort and my mind is tired and I'm
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   busy with affairs and my business is in trouble and so on and so forth I really
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.720]   can't do it and I'll go somewhere else where I have some a simple plain message
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:10.760]   that I say is to deny the scripture the Apostle Paul prays that the minds of
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.640]   these Ephesians might be strengthened in order that they might realize these
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.760]   higher possibilities and experience them and rejoice in them and so bear their
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:27.840]   witness and their testimony to the glory of God the intellectual lethargy of many
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.640]   Christians today is undoubtedly their greatest sin they never grow in
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.680]   knowledge they end where they began they're always talking about their
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.160]   experiences they've never entered into these riches they have never gone up to
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:48.880]   this mountaintop and breathe the pure air of God's holy truth they are content
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.720]   with the ordinary level they don't believe in the other because it demands
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.840]   effort and intellectual effort but in exactly the same way the heart needs to
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:11.160]   be strengthened because we are attacked by fears by our imaginations we are
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:20.480]   subject to discouragement we tend to indulge in evil for birdings even when
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.520]   everything is going well with us our hearts begin to say oh it's all right at
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.800]   the moment but you never know what's coming and immediately you're depressed
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.360]   you put yourself into trouble haven't we all experienced that how treacherous the
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.760]   heart can be it can conjure up possibilities and we go and meet them
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.320]   what if this happens what if that happens what if this child dies what if
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.520]   I lose my loved one and so on and we can make ourselves wretched nothing's
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:54.280]   happening but we're only imagining what we'd be like if it did happen the heart
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:02.600]   thus these fears and forebodings and discouragements and evil imaginations
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.120]   often play havoc with the Christian and there are some Christians whose whole
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:12.360]   course is bound in shallows and in miseries because they've never realized
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.120]   the need of having their hearts strengthened by the Holy Spirit and in
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:22.400]   the same way the will needs to be strengthened our wills are feeble and
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:28.040]   irresolute as the result of sin and the fall yes we said there it is I'm going
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.560]   to do that and we really want to and then at the last moment we are afraid we
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:38.840]   don't we stop there I agree with Bishop Mole 100% this failure of the will what
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.080]   if I do what will happen and so on and the will is paralyzed or made
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.360]   irresolute and we fail to do the thing that we know we should do how often do
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:56.320]   we fail at the very last moment well there it is you see the moment you begin
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:01.600]   to look into this in a man and to analyze him you see that he's very weak
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:08.520]   he's very feeble he needs to be strengthened do you know my friends were
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.640]   it not that we've got the prayer of the Apostle here which we can offer for
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:19.400]   ourselves we should every one of us fail and falter how often have we all failed
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:28.160]   and faltered in mind or in heart or in will and if we were left to ourselves I
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:32.720]   say there would be no hope for us and there'd be nobody to recommend the
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:40.160]   gospel but thank God there is this way of strengthening and the Apostle puts it
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.080]   here so perfectly for us so that however weak you may feel yourself at this
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:52.000]   moment however much you may have failed this is the way the Apostles prayer is
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.760]   that he who is he well he's the father to whom he's just been referring the
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.960]   father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and in earth
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:17.640]   is named that he it's all right I can be reinforced by God I can't do it I can't
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:22.920]   put this iron into the walls of my soul to receive Christ do as I will I fail
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:28.680]   but here is strength from God he and then you notice the next term may grant
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:36.640]   you what a blessed word that is that word grant we are familiar with it oh
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.200]   yes he said he makes me a grant he gives me this free gift you see you don't have
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   to earn it you don't have to purchase it it's a free gift of God you simply ask
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:52.720]   for it and receive it that he may grant you the feeblest saint can just lift up
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.160]   his face when he can't stand on his feet he just looks and says Lord have mercy
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:05.080]   upon me and God will strengthen him he will grant you and then you see in order
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:11.240]   to impress it upon a seat says he will grant you according to the riches of his
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:21.360]   glory forgive me for rushing through these phrases as I do I apologize for
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:27.160]   going through this epistle so quickly fancy rushing a phrase like this at the
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:33.560]   end of a sermon according to the riches of his glory what's he talking about
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:38.200]   what is the glory of God well it's the sum the summation of all the attributes
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:45.080]   of God his might his majesty his holiness his purity his righteousness
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:51.560]   his justice God in the totality of his being the glory of God and it is
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:59.800]   according to the riches the fullness of that glory that God is able to do what
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:05.440]   well to strengthen us with might and that's the might according to the riches
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:17.800]   of his glory to strengthen us with power by his spirit it is the special function
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:25.240]   of the Holy Spirit to do this he has given to us he is sent to us to do this
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:33.600]   very thing it was the same Holy Spirit that convicted us of sin that gave us
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.920]   the gift of faith that enabled us to believe we could never have believed
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:44.080]   without him it's he who enables us all the natural men receiveth not God hath
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.360]   given unto us of his spirit and by the spirit we do believe we are spiritual
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:57.160]   men well that same spirit can do this for us also you notice how Paul put it
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:02.320]   there in that fourth chapter of the epistle to the Philippians in verses 6
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:08.560]   and 7 he said in nothing be anxious you see when things go wrong we tend to
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.400]   become anxious don't we were well in our hearts and in our minds in nothing be
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.040]   anxious well what then what can I do how can I get rid of anxiety in all things
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.440]   with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving because you realize who God
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.680]   is and what he's ready to do in the riches of his glory with prayer and
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.840]   supplication and thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God what
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:39.400]   happens Oh the peace of God that passes all understanding shall keep your hearts
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:46.880]   and minds in Christ Jesus the circumstances are not changed they
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.920]   remain exactly what they were well what's happened where'd you get your
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.640]   peace from Oh the Holy Spirit has strengthened your heart he's strengthened
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:44:01.920]   your mind so you can resist the power and you're safe there it is the prayer
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:11.280]   that the Apostle offers I trust I've made the doctrine clear to you we are
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:16.400]   living in days when we are constantly talking about reinforcing things they
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.200]   reinforce concrete today don't they ferro concrete concrete's very strong
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.860]   put some iron into it'll be stronger still and as you put up your massive
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.920]   buildings you need something to support and to hold the weight and all that's
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:36.040]   going to be put in very well reinforced concrete reinforce this and that that's
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:44.120]   the principle if you and I are to contain the Lord Jesus Christ within us
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:53.880]   and to be filled with all the fullness of God we must be reinforced in the
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:04.200]   inner man by the Holy Spirit and if we realize that these are possibilities for
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:11.640]   us and desire them and we ask God thus according to the riches of his glory to
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:21.480]   reinforce us by his spirit he has promised to do it and Christ will dwell
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:31.400]   in our hearts by faith beloved Christian people are you as much above the level
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:38.080]   of the ordinary Christian as the ordinary Christian is above the level of
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:46.120]   the men who isn't a Christian at all that's the wondrous glorious possibility
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:53.920]   that is there for us everyone at this moment in Jesus Christ by the grace of
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:46:02.360]   God we do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of dr. martin lloyd
