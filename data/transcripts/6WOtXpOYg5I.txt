[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   [Music]
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.900]   What is the greatest problem in the universe?
[00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.100]   And what is the greatest problem in my heart?
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.200]   And what is the solution to these problems?
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.100]   John Piper explained in a 2015 sermon, but first he explained why the universe exists
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.100]   and why you and I exist. Here's what he said.
[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.800]   So the meaning of human life, the meaning of existence, the meaning of the universe
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.000]   is at its core all things to be used to show how magnificent God is.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.700]   This universe is about God. You know, sometimes I've heard skeptics or atheists
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:57.100]   shake their heads at the notion that Christians could believe that on this infinitesimal planet
[00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.600]   where there is a self-conscious being called man could believe that God created the universe
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.100]   about that. Because as far as we know it's just so vast and empty.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.100]   And I say, you've got it totally upside down.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.300]   It's not about that. That is to show this little infinitesimal people something little about God.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.800]   The universe is to display God to that little planet.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.000]   It's not about that little planet. It's about God.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.700]   And the universe is God's best effort to say that's how big I am.
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's how strong I am. That's how glorious and magnificent.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.100]   The galaxies are all about God, not man. There's nothing unusual about it at all.
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.700]   The disproportion between the universe in all of its vast glory and infinitesimal little man
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   is perfectly rational if you're God-centered.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   If God is all, if God is the reality in the universe, and man is his little amazing worshiping group.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   So we've learned that that's why we exist and therefore money, sex, and power are in the world
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.400]   for us to use in order to make God look great.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Then we discovered another foundational reality, namely that we have all exchanged the glory of God
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.300]   everywhere we've looked. We have seen it. We have known it in some deep sense and we've suppressed it.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.200]   And we have preferred other things to God.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.100]   And that's the arch heresy and the greatest outrage of the universe,
[00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.900]   that people prefer other things to God.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.900]   They exchange. They see God. They trade God. They embrace their death, call it their glory.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.300]   And that's the tragedy and the outrage of history.
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.500]   The image we used at the end of the last hour was that all of the parts of our lives,
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   and sex, money, and power are three of them. You could add many more like family or work,
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   are like planets in a solar system.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.700]   And they are designed to be held by the massive beauty and blazing gravitational pull
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.500]   of a sovereign and all-satisfying God at the center of our lives.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.700]   And when He's there and He is all to us and all-satisfying to us,
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.300]   then the planets are moving perfectly in their beautiful, God-glorifying, soul-satisfying orbit.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.500]   Sex, power, money, all circling the sun just the way they were designed.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.100]   And nobody has God at the center like that until they are born of God.
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.700]   So the whole universe is out of order because we replaced the sun with little moons and little asteroids
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.100]   and little crazy things at the center of the solar system of our lives.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.700]   And the planets are flying all out of order.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.100]   We're murdering each other and killing each other and destroying each other's sexual lives
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.700]   and manipulating and controlling and exploiting each other with money and power.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.100]   And people wonder, "What's wrong?"
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100]   I say, "Well, where is God?"
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.100]   "Well, that doesn't have anything to do with it."
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.100]   "It has everything to do with it. He is everything.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.100]   And if you treat Him like He's nothing, don't expect anything to work
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100]   because He didn't make it that way.
[00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.100]   He made the universe and our souls for Him to be at the blazing center."
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.100]   Amen. This is a little window into everything we do at Desiring God.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100]   By the way, this message excerpt was taken from a message given last summer in a series titled
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.100]   "Living in the Light with Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.100]   A four-part series, three messages, a Q&A, and all available at DesiringGod.org.
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.100]   The messages were edited, expanded, and became the new book, "Living in the Light, Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.100]   A nice little hardcover available now on Amazon and downloadable free of charge at DesiringGod.org/books.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.100]   Well, John Piper has been studying the Book of Romans for decades,
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.100]   and this little sermon clip is just one little glimpse into the fruit of those lifelong labors.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.100]   Tomorrow, I'm going to ask John Piper to give me a list of his five favorite books on the Book of Romans.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.100]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.100]   .
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.100]   .
