[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   So what do we normally talk about here? The general topic is how do you cultivate a deep life
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.840]   in a world that is increasingly distracted? Now, if you go back and look at all the things I've
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.040]   said about this topic, you could put these into three main categories of advice. Category number
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.200]   one is just how do you get your act together? How do you get organized in both your life
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.160]   and in your job? How do you stay on top of your task and your commitments? How do you find enough
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.040]   control over your schedule to actually intentionally choose what you want to do and what you don't want
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.360]   to do? How do you develop discipline? But that's not the category I want to talk about today.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.640]   The second category of advice is about how do you add the stuff that really matters to you
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.200]   and how do you subtract the stuff that doesn't matter to you? So how do you add what's important
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.840]   and subtract what's not? This could be big changes to your job or where you live or removing from
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.000]   your life things that are really draining your energy. But that's not the category I want to
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.960]   talk about today either. What I want to talk about comes from the third category, which is how do you
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.200]   periodically reflect on your life and what you've been doing, reflect on what you care about and
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.880]   where you're trying to go, and then iterate back into the decisions you're making. It's that stepping
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.000]   away to reflect and iterate that drives forward the process of trying to cultivate a deeper life.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.280]   That's a big category, but there's one specific idea within that third category that I want to
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:43.600]   focus on today, and that is self-help. If you are going to continually focus what matters to you and
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.240]   your strategies for how to get there, you are going to have to consume self-help. Now this term
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   is one that I think is broad, but we often narrow what we think it means. So when we think about it,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.360]   we're imagining potentially cheesy books from the self-help shelf in the bookstore that's going to
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.120]   have a lot of lists of advice or a lot of emotional encouragement, like you can do it,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.600]   go get after it. It's a very narrow thing, something we're almost embarrassed about.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.960]   I think though, what I'm going to try to argue here today is that the variety of information
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.680]   sources that count as self-help is much, much broader, and understanding this and understanding
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.120]   how to intelligently navigate this landscape of self-help writ large is absolutely necessary if
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   you want to become wiser and therefore have a foundation on which to cultivate a truly deep
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.440]   life. So here's what I'm going to do today. I'm going to break the broad category of self-help
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.880]   into three smaller categories, and I'm going to talk about each, and I'll give you a piece of
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.160]   advice for each about how to navigate that particular collection of self-help sources
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.400]   in the most effective way possible. Then too, at the end, I have a couple of thoughts about
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   what you should do with all of this information. I'm talking logistically, administratively,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   what do you do with all the information that you encounter in your self-help journey so that you
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.920]   can actually remember to make use of it going forward? All right, so that's my plan. For those
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.720]   who are watching, I'm going to bring up my tablet here. So if you're listening and you want to watch
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   this, this is episode 286. Just go to the deeplife.com/list and find episode 286. The video
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.760]   of the episode will be posted below. All right, so here's what's on my screen. For those who can't
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.680]   see it, there is a header, three categories, because I am going to divide the world of things
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.000]   we could potentially call self-help into three categories. And I am going to expertly draw,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   because as Jesse knows, I'm a fantastic artist. When I draw on this tablet, it is not unlike
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   Picasso drawing the peasant's hands. I'm going to draw a picture for each of these categories.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.120]   Those who are watching can try to guess. All right, so for the first category,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.920]   let's see, what am I going to draw here? Jesse's gotten pretty good at guessing,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.560]   roughly speaking, at least when I'm drawing. Maybe not what the category is. All right. Yay.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   All right, so I'm realizing now, Jesse, what I drew kind of looks like a body in a coffin.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.320]   It's not what I meant. I mean, category one, it would be funny if my first category was like,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.760]   you want real self-help? You need to hang out at the cemetery. Memento mori, you sons of bitches.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.480]   You got to look at the corpses and say, that's going to be me. No, that's supposed to be a phone.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.720]   That's supposed to be a phone with someone dancing on it. All right. So what is this
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.880]   first category? I call it pre-digested self-help. So what I mean by pre-digested is that these are
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.760]   forms of self-help in which the advice has already been extracted and clarified for you.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.320]   Here's some ideas, but more importantly, here's what you should do. Like here's 10 things you
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.440]   should do. Here's a plan you can follow. Here's a particular procedure that you can put into place.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   So it has, someone has taken an information from the world that is relevant to improving yourself
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.160]   and digested it for you already. And they have been given it to you in the form of advice.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.520]   There's three big categories, subcategories in here. And what I'm going to do is list them in
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:22.880]   the order of increasing quality. And by quality, I mean potential for impact in your own life.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.000]   So within pre-digested, the lowest quality subcategory would be short videos and social
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.920]   media posts. It is a lot of this, a lot of Instagram, a lot of tech talk, a lot of YouTube
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.680]   that is, Hey, I'm going to help you figure out how to cut fat so you can get shredded.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.280]   I'm going to help you figure out like how to study better for your exam. And let's go
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   a lot of this content, nothing wrong with it. But the reason why I'm putting that at the bottom
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.000]   of the hierarchy here is that there are different objectives for the authors of this content.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.280]   There's sort of mixed motivations. The number one thing, if you're creating this type of content
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.720]   is virality. So really the master that these content creators are serving is they want the
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.400]   relevant algorithm to like and bless what they're doing over time. This pushes the way the content
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   goes. It doesn't mean there's not useful information in this content, but the goal
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.960]   of the content is not to be as useful to you as possible. It's to get recommended as many times
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   as possible. Right? And so this, this is different. So it's the most watchable of all self-help
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.760]   content. It's the easiest and most accessible because it's, it draws you along. You don't have
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.680]   to exert any will to continue watching it, but it's also perhaps the most diluted because the
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.560]   objective here is not really to make you better at what they're talking about. That's secondary.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.120]   Primary is virality. And that's not always the same thing. All right. The second subcategory
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.120]   of predigested self-help I'm going to say is podcast. These are better because when you're
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.000]   creating a podcast, that's relevant to self-help. So a podcast like this one, right? Give you advice.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.520]   I'm not serving at the altar of virality because that's not the way that podcasting works. There
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.000]   is no algorithm that recommends podcast. And if you, if you do something just right with your
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.680]   content, you're going to be recommended to a couple million people and have this big growth.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.000]   Now, podcasting is very word of mouth. It's very organic. If you like this show enough,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.200]   you'll eventually tell someone about it. Well, what makes you like a show over the weeks or
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.440]   months that you've listened to it? It's been effective for you. So listening to podcasts
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.880]   that are giving advice, this is a higher level of predigested self-help because the incentives are
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.440]   now aligned. I want to make this show as useful as possible to you because that's how this show
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.240]   grows. Not because, you know, there's a thumbnail that's attention catching. The third subcategory,
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.880]   this is the, what most people think about when they think about self-help is advice books.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.880]   So I put this at a higher level of quality than just podcast because like podcast,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.160]   the incentive is in line. I want this book to really help people. That's how you sell more
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:15.120]   advice books. Remember, it's not marketing. It's not publicity. When Deep Work was published,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.800]   I was disappointed. There wasn't a big marketing or publicity push. Friends of mine were going to
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.360]   Barnes and Noble and they were telling my friends, "Oh, we don't even, you know,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.160]   we didn't bother stocking a copy of this book." Fast forward now, we're coming up to the eighth
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.320]   year that this book has been out, one and a half to 2 million copies sold. Why? Because over time,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.160]   people found it worked and they're like, okay, they told other people about it.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.760]   So advice books like podcast, advice podcast want to be useful,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:48.080]   but the authors have more time to clarify, clean up, and polish what they're saying. When you read
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.920]   an advice book, like my new book, Slow Productivity, this is something I spent a year writing,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.880]   right? A year trying to get my thoughts right and clarified into the most useful structure.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.840]   After spending before that, another two years previously, just thinking about those ideas,
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.760]   writing articles, podcasting on it, just thinking about it in conversation.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.040]   And then all of that goes through extensive editing. Well, this isn't quite clear. How do
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.320]   we make this better? So what you get in an advice book is pre-digested advice for making your life
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.520]   better that has been polished and thought through to the furthest extent possible of the person
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.520]   working on it. So that's going to be the highest quality of pre-digested self-help advice.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.720]   All right. So what's my advice for navigating this particular category of self-help?
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.640]   I would say be wary of the short videos and social media posts. You could use those for
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.600]   entertainment. Be wary about using them too much as a source of advice for how to live your life,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:51.280]   because again, the quality is the least aligned. And you have this fear of scratching an itch
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.520]   insufficiently. And what I mean by that is that we have a human drive to want to improve.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.840]   That drives us to seek out this information. Your fear is that you scratch that itch entirely with
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.640]   TikTok videos. Hey there. I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:14.720]   Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout. If you like the type of things I
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.480]   talk about on this channel, you're really going to like this book. It distills all of my ideas
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.840]   into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step instructions for putting it into action. Now,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:34.400]   if you pre-order this book before it comes out on March 5th, I have some bonuses I want to offer you
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:41.280]   as my way of saying thanks. These include a chapter-by-chapter audio commentary from me,
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.880]   the author, and a crash course that will teach you how to put the ideas of slow productivity
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.040]   into action in your own life right away. So to find out more about the book and how
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:00.400]   to redeem your pre-order bonuses, check out calnewport.com/slow. Everything you need,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.960]   you can find there. All right, thanks. Let's get back to it.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.920]   And you've convinced yourself, yeah, I'm taking in advice and I'm making my life better, but
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.400]   the information is not really that quality. So you're not really getting what you need. It's
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.600]   like scratching the itch of hunger with junk food. It kind of works in the moment, but long-term,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.680]   that's not going to be a good strategy. On the podcast side, have a rotation of high-quality
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.760]   advice podcasts. They're just a part of your life. Of course, I hope that rotation includes
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.520]   our show here, but there's other good ones as well. And then when it comes to advice books,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   you want to read, I would say at least one per month. The good news is they're not hard to read.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.640]   They're typically readable in a few sessions. You can skim the parts that aren't particularly
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.040]   important. You can use a service like Blinkist if you want to get the main ideas in advance to
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.960]   figure out which books are worth reading, but I think you should do one a month. So if you have
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.520]   two or three podcasts a week that you just regularly listen to in the background and you
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.760]   read one advice book per month, that is a really good stream of high-quality, pre-digested self-help
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:10.560]   content. All right, that's where most people stop when they think self-help, but that's just one of
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.520]   the three categories that I want you to consider. All right, so we're going to go to category two,
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   which once again, I will expertly draw. This I'm better at drawing. I think, well, all right,
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:38.720]   there we go. Now, I'll have to explain. Got this and let me draw. All right, so what I've drawn
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:47.120]   here, Jesse, this should be clear, is a book. And the thing next to it is, here I'll draw
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:52.240]   projection lines. It's a movie screen. All right, so what do I mean by the second category? I'm
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.440]   going to call it interpersonal. That's not going to make sense at first until I explain it, but
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:05.360]   this is an important one. Interpersonal is a category that includes media, typically in book
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.720]   form or movie form, in which you create an emotional, empathetic connection with another
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:20.560]   character. So it elicits in you an empathetic connection. I can feel what this person is
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:27.600]   feeling. I feel privy to the inner psychological state of this other character. So you could get
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.520]   this in memoir. I'm reading a memoir of someone. I'm really, over time, getting to understand this
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.840]   person and what they were going through and what their life was like. It could be novel, right? I
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.720]   mean, what is a novel? If anything, a good novel is a mind-reading device, an author connecting
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.240]   your brain to the brain of a character that they've crafted. That's what you're using words
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:56.800]   to induce emotional states in the reader. And documentary can do this as well. All sorts of
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.800]   films can, but documentary in particular, if it's focusing on a particular subject, if well done,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.880]   it sort of brings you into that person's life. That's why I call it interpersonal. You're
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.040]   connecting to another person, another character. So why is this important? Well, one of the deep
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:20.400]   sources of powerful self-reflection comes from encountering another person in the psychologically
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.920]   complex way and feeling resonance. There's something about the way they live their life
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:33.200]   that resonates with me. There's something about, be it their internal character or something about
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.560]   the external world in which they live, the living on the island, the slower existence,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:44.800]   or maybe it's the will or fortitude of a heroic leader type character, or maybe it's the exactitude
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.920]   and focus on craft of a sort of Jiro from Jiro Dreams of Sushi documentary, right?
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.960]   Something resonates about you, about another person to which you have an empathetic connection.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.840]   That's a huge source of wisdom because you have this complicated connection to the person. When
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.480]   you feel resonance, you can study this connection and say, what is it about this person that's
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.280]   causing this sense of resonance, this sense of attraction or appealingness? And that's great
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.960]   insight into what matters for you and what matters in your picture of a life well lived.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:22.400]   So you have to think about these sophisticated characterizations that you encounter
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.160]   as just as important as a source of self-help as reading slow productivity or deep work,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.400]   or listening to a podcast like this. Think about it in that same framework.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.080]   So what's my advice for actually navigating this interpersonal category? Well, you got to be
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.160]   emotionally open when you encounter these sources, reading a novel, watching documentary, be willing
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.080]   to open up and create that empathetic connection. Because again, you have to create
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.640]   in yourself these reactions because that's what you're going to study to figure out what
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.040]   matters to you. So you have to be emotionally open. Keep your resonance radar high.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.960]   You should really have this tripwire of, oh, wait a second. Something about what I'm seeing or
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:15.040]   reading is feeling very appealing to me. I don't know what it is. I'm watching this movie about
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.320]   big wave surfers and they're in Hawaii and something here is working for me. I don't know
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.840]   why, but it is. Keep your resonance radar high. When that tripwire trips, you're like, okay,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:29.680]   there is something here to be examined. Then be willing once you feel that sense of resonance to
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.840]   almost right away in the moment or right after to do the internal work to figure out, well,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.280]   what specifically about what I just read or saw or encountered, what specifically about that
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:44.000]   was appealing to me. And you have to do a little bit of forensic analysis here.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.040]   And a good way to do this is to take out elements and then test it.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:54.080]   Well, is it the surfing in the big wave surfing thing, like the sport, the challenge? Well,
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.560]   let me take that part, but remove it from Hawaii and all of that. And just imagine
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:04.960]   someone training for a big sport like this with an otherwise busy lifestyle. Now that doesn't
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.520]   resonate the same. Okay. So let me take the surfing out of it and just keep in it living
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.320]   somewhere natural and having to slower schedule. Oh, that's still working for me. Okay. So what's
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.040]   resonating here, nature and slowness, maybe. All right. So let me try to separate these two things.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.920]   Let me think about a slow existence in an urban environment. Do I still have the same resonance?
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.080]   Let me think. So you know what I'm doing here is I'm taking out elements. It's like a differential
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.800]   diagnosis in medicine, doing internal work while the emotions are still fresh to figure out what
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.720]   exactly in here is resonating. So these interpersonal sources of self-help advice,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.880]   do not sleep on those. There's a lot of wisdom lurking. All right. Let's go. Let's go to our
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:56.560]   third category here. All right. All right. I know what I'm going to draw. Oh, no, that's not good.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.680]   Hold on. I aborted. I'm going to try again. All right. Sitting. I'm going to put them on.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.800]   I've drawn this before, Jesse, so you might recognize it.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:18.640]   All right. It is Rodin's The Thinker. Again, expertly, expertly drawn. It's a man sitting on
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:25.120]   a rock. And what I'm talking about here is probably what people would have thought about
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:32.720]   the term that didn't exist. But if you explain to them the goal of self-help, right, information is
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.440]   going to improve my life. This is what people would have thought of for hundreds of years until
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:46.880]   most recently. I'm going to call this the scholarly slash theological category of self-help content.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.720]   Right. These are the heavy hitters, the heavy hitter sources that scare most people away.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.920]   We're talking about seriously serious scholarly works that touch on meaning.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   Works of philosophers, for example. We're also talking here serious theological works like
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:12.000]   religious text or religious commentaries, theology, and scholarly philosophy. There is clearly a lot
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.920]   of wisdom in here for living your life well, but it also scares a lot of people off.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.640]   Right. This is complicated stuff. I'm not just going to pick up Heidegger or, you know,
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.560]   Haftor reading in the original Hebrew and just like jump into it. I feel better with TikTok.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:40.240]   So this kind of scares people away, but it shouldn't if you have the proper on-ramp
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.800]   into these deep ideas. So in fact, I'm even going to draw below this little on-ramp.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.680]   So it's like an on-ramp. Well, it's a ramp. It's not an on-ramp, but a ramp. There we go.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:57.760]   I drew in a ramp towards the thinker. So you don't have to start. You don't have to start
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.960]   with the really complicated, seriously scholarly or theological text. Where you can start is
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   secondary sources. So say, okay, here's where we're gonna start first. People writing about
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.840]   the serious text, explaining them, their role in their life, why they're important.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.640]   This is way more accessible because it's written with less jargon meant to be accessible in the
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.880]   vernacular that you're currently used to. Right. So it may be, instead of jumping straight into
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.200]   Marcus Aurelius, you say, I'm going to read Ryan Holiday first. Ryan is a secondary source
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.080]   talking about this primary source. Maybe before you say, I'm going to explore,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.840]   you know, my Christian faith by reading the gospels. Why don't I read like a Tim Keller
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.080]   book first? Makes it more accessible, right? It's talking about those books,
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.760]   but it's not actually those books. Maybe existentialism. There's something here. I
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   really want to know about these thinkers, but they're really hard. So you can read
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.160]   at the existential cafe, right? This is Sarah, I think Blakewell, which has like a great secondary
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.800]   source talking about these philosophers, but it's not directly the philosophy itself.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.520]   So you could start with secondary sources. From there, you can move to what I call
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:20.480]   accessible primary sources. So now these are serious works, serious or scholarly or theological
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.760]   thinking, but they're relatively accessible. You can read this without having to have
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.600]   a lot of expert background. I think, for example, we talked about this in the show.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.760]   I bought an early edition of Thomas Merton's Seven Story Mountain, which has some really
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.280]   interesting reflections on theology and life, but it's accessible because he's also telling
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:48.320]   his story. Same thing with like Augustine's Confessions. It's accessible. It's the very
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.160]   first psychologically real autobiography. I think from a philosophical standpoint,
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.960]   Thoreau is very accessible. Walden is something you can read, and he's making philosophical
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:08.240]   arguments about the life well lived. You can get them, right? You can go through that. It's
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.640]   an accessible primary source. And then finally, you can build your way up to the expert primary
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.960]   sources. Now you're reading the original philosophers in translation. Now you're
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.320]   grappling with the original religious text or the serious religious commentaries. It's not
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:34.800]   Tim Keller anymore. It's Thomas Aquinas. It's not just reading Ryan Holiday. Now it's grappling
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.600]   with the Stoics directly themselves, etc. So what's my advice here? That you build towards
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.200]   expert sources. You build towards the expert sources by starting with secondary sources
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:52.480]   that teach you a lot about what you were going to read. They give you the landscape of ideas
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.600]   so that by the time you get to the expert source, you really sort of understand the references and
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.000]   what you're trying to get out of this. I would recommend at least once per year, if not twice,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.840]   build towards an expert source. And you might read two or three secondary sources to get there.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:12.240]   Meanwhile, you can sprinkle in accessible primary sources, the ones that you can just dive in and
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.680]   read and get wisdom out of directly without it requiring a lot of prior study. You might want
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.400]   to retain a one to two or one to three ratio of accessible primary sources to standard self-help
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:30.880]   advice books. So for every two or three standard self-help or advice book I read, I'll try to read
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.960]   one more scholarly or theological primary source that's accessible. There you're going to get the
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.160]   right mix. So you build up the one real expert source per year that you dive into, and you have
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.760]   a steady, not overwhelming, but sort of steady background drumbeat of sort of accessible primary
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.280]   sources that are thinking seriously about how to make your life better and what strategies
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.840]   get you there. This is a more sophisticated strategy for consuming self-help. It draws
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.640]   from these different categories, all of which have something to add, and it does so in a balanced
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:11.040]   manner. It is a key attribute, I think, of any intentional plan to live a deeper life is to make
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.000]   sure that you are fueling that engine of insight and thoughts and decisions with better and better
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.480]   understanding of what it is that actually matters for you. So that comes to my final piece of
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.120]   advice is, well, what do you do with all this information you're discovering? You should store
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.840]   it. The stuff that really matters should be extracted and written down somewhere.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.520]   So one of my recommendations is that you should think about what you're trying to do here is to
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:43.200]   maintain a personal operating system. I have a personal operating system that sort of specifies
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:49.280]   how I live my life, what values are important to me, what commitments I have, what actions I do
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.080]   and don't do. You have this personal operating system, and I use the operating system metaphor
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.000]   in part because I'm a nerd, but also in part because we think about operating systems as
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.480]   something you upgrade all the time. So there's no notion of like, I have to figure out the right
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.960]   operating system for living. You want some operating system and you're going to be upgrading
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:13.600]   this regularly. One of the big sources of this upgrading is going to be this encounter,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.920]   this balanced, intelligent, comprehensive encounter with self-help. So wherever you
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.520]   write down this operating system, and I don't want to get too caught in the weeds of structure
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.440]   format here. You do what works, but wherever you write down, here's what matters to me. Here's
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.480]   what I'm trying to head towards. Here's the commitments, the things I do, and here's the
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.680]   things I definitely don't do. Wherever you write that down, you can have a place to capture and
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:41.280]   refine big ideas that you've encountered in self-help. This is resonating, this is resonating.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.160]   And over time, as ideas in that list that is important really stay there and prominently
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.800]   catch your attention, they can influence the operating system rules ahead that are above it.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.760]   Now, these ideas that I've had down here, been here for a year now, I'm going to update my values
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.560]   in the operating system to reflect that. This over here is really resonating with me. I
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.240]   encountered this in a documentary and then in a couple other novels.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.920]   It's going to change my list of commitments. Like I always do this, or I don't do this.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:13.120]   So you need some sort of personal operating system to guide this whole effort to live
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.680]   a deep life. And that's a topic we can dive into in depth in a completely different episode.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.960]   But that's where you capture these ideas. And that's ultimately where these ideas that come
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.200]   out of self-help to catch your attention. That's where they ultimately are going to have their
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.840]   impact. Changing the OS that you use to drive all of your other efforts to live a deeper life.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.720]   So self-help doesn't have to just be Eckhart Tolle and hack videos on YouTube.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.840]   It's a much broader term. We should treat it as a much broader term. And it's something we should
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.840]   take seriously. It's hard to live a deep life if you don't have a good evolving sense of what
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.320]   deep actually means. - I got a couple of follow-up questions.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.240]   - What have we got? - What was your
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.360]   expert source in 2023? - Well, I read, I probably read
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   more than one per year. We have to go back and look at our books read list.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:19.520]   I've recently been reading a lot of Heschel, who's definitely a primary source scholarly thinker.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.840]   We read some Stoicism in the original, if you'll remember going back. I'm reading the entire,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.720]   I started this in 2023 and it continues in 2024. I'm reading the entire Hebrew Bible.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.960]   There's a set schedule. So the first five books of the Bible, there's a set schedule that both
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.880]   Jews and Christians will follow in their study that breaks it up into 50 readings that spreads
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:54.160]   over the year. So right now, it's the same for everybody, right? So you can follow this along,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.440]   just look up what's the weekly Torah reading. And you'll find that a lot of different websites,
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.520]   Christian and Jewish. Like this week is 10 Commandments, actually the Decalogue is in
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.880]   this week. So we're in Exodus, the second book of the Bible. Last week was the song of the sea
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.960]   and the Red Sea crashing on the whatever. So that's a project I'm doing right now.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   It's very accessible in the sense that it's not much reading. These readings aren't too long
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   each week. And then what you typically do or what I typically do is couple each reading
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:36.800]   with a commentary. So someone writing a commentary on that week's reading. So I figured that's a
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.200]   cultural touchstone. They have really read through the first five books of the Bible,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:48.160]   what the Jewish tradition would call the Torah. And so there's another sort of source that I'm
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.520]   working on. That's a good question. I'd have to go back and look at my list in 2023. I think
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:29:00.240]   there's multiple philosophical and theological primary sources I grappled with, but I'd have
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.960]   to go back. I'm reading some Chesterton right now. He's an interesting thinker. I guess that's 2024.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.920]   >> I need to bump up my self-advice one a month per book.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   >> Yeah, right. Because what I say in the one a month per self-advice book.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.840]   >> Yeah, I don't do that.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:23.280]   >> At least one expert theological philosophical source you're building towards per year
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.000]   and like a three to one ratio. So if you're doing a three to one ratio of accessible primary source
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:35.760]   to self-help book, that means three of those a year, maybe three months, self-help book,
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.920]   fourth month, accessible primary source, or maybe you do both in that month. So
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:48.480]   I basically want people to up the variety of their intellectual diet here, basically. And of course,
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.320]   as with all my advice, the foundation of that is stop spending so much time looking at things
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.880]   on screens. >> Yeah, your analogy about eating junk
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.400]   food and satisfying your hunger was really good. >> Yeah, big screens are fine. Big
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.760]   screens are fine. But anything that's meant for virality, it's just the nutrients have been
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.240]   pulled out of that food. All right. Well, anyways, we got a good group of questions.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.200]   Before we get there, though, I want to talk about some of the sponsors that makes the show possible.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.640]   First, let's talk about our friends at Grammarly, one of the original sponsors of this show.

[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:13.760]   our friends at Element. Element is a zero sugar electrolyte drink born from a growing body of
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.320]   research revealing that optimal health outcomes occur at sodium levels, two to three times the
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.040]   government recommendation. So each stick pack delivers a meaningful dose of electrolytes,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:30.240]   free of sugar, artificial colors, or other dodgy ingredients. It is formulated for anyone on a
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.600]   mission to restore health through hydration and is perfectly suited for athletes,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.800]   folks who are fasting, or those following keto, low carb, whole food, or paleo diets.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.200]   Element is one of these things that's a sponsor of the show that I also buy
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:50.720]   regularly. Element is what I use when I hydrate after working out. I'll also drink it in the
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.200]   morning if I feel like the day before I was talking all the time and I lost a lot of
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.800]   water and I've dehydrated myself. I want to make sure I get the sodium and the water as well.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.080]   I love the taste. I love there's no sugar, no artificial junk. It just makes the water have
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.680]   what it needs without having all this other sort of stuff in there as well. Element was co-founded
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.920]   by Rob Wolf, former biochemist who has sat on the Navy SEAL resiliency committee for over a decade.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.120]   I think I did Rob's podcast before. I might be misremembering that, but I think I've met Rob
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:32.880]   before. Here's the type of people who use Element. Team USA weightlifting, NFL, NBA, and NHL athletes,
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:39.280]   special forces, including Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams, and Marines, they all use Element.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.040]   I think we can see what happened here. Rob Wolf was looking at these users,
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.960]   sniper teams, Navy SEALs, U.S. Olympic weightlifters, and Rob was like, "This is great,
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   but can we get a real man in here?" What I really want is to associate this with a really manly man
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.400]   who knows, the type of man that other men just bow down, the ultimate alpha. SEALs are fine.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:10.240]   Olympic weightlifters are fine, but you know what we really need? A computer science professor
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:17.120]   who podcasts about to-do lists. This is going to alpha, not going to be some beta tool,
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:22.160]   this is going to alpha-size our Element. That's why they came to get me. Actually,
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.560]   Rob knows I use Element and love it. It keeps me hydrated. I want to mention briefly,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.720]   they also have a new hot version. The Element chocolate medley featuring chocolate mint,
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.200]   chocolate chai, and chocolate raspberry is designed to be enjoyed hot. It's great in the
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.400]   winter after all that snow shoveling, get your hydration without something cool.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:46.320]   All right, here's the deal. Members of my community can receive a free Element sample pack
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:52.640]   with any order they do. If they go to do their order through drinkelement.com/deep,

[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.000]   a salty friend and they will give you your money back, no questions asked.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   We have a very low return rate and they have a very high reorder rate, so they feel confident
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.560]   offering that risk-free offer. Go to drinkelementlmnt.com/deep to get your free sample
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:30.320]   pack with anything you order. All right, let's get on to some questions. Who do we have first, Jesse?
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.920]   Hi, first question is from Larry. I have found what seems to be the crux of my inconsistency
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:41.440]   with personal productivity. I have a decent system in place and can get on a roll, have a good week
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.880]   or two, but then it all falls apart when I run into a task that acts like an impenetrable brick
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.080]   wall. I can't bear to look at it directly and end up cowering into escapism activities of endless
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:59.280]   scrolling or videos. Is there general advice for facing down these hard tasks? Well, I mean,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:04.960]   I think the key here, Larry, is when you get to these brick wall tasks, your solution is to punt
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:12.240]   on the task, not on your system, right? So there's a couple of things going on. I think one, the way
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:19.040]   you're thinking about your systems is in the game version, right? We talk about this often on the
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:23.840]   show that people think about, especially when we talk about planning systems, in a particular daily
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:30.720]   planning systems, that it's a game and you win the game if you can build this perfect plan that you
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:37.280]   follow exactly. And you lose the game if you fall off the plan, right? So there's a gamified version
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.600]   of professional planning. The problem with this version is that when you fall off the plan, you
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:49.760]   say, I lost the game. So why keep, you know, why keep playing, right? Like once the, that final
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.040]   touchdown has been scored, you don't stay on the field and keep playing. So you're like, okay,
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.320]   then, you know, whatever, I failed today. Let's load up the browser. Let's get the TikTok up and
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.800]   going. That's the wrong way to think about professional planning. It's not a game.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:08.480]   The goal is not the win. The goal instead is to apply intention to your activities.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.960]   The binary you should care about is not stuck with schedule, failed to stick with schedule,
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.800]   but instead have intention for what I'm doing right now versus don't have intention for what
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.880]   I'm doing right now. And how do you get intention by having a plan and what happens when you fall
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.400]   off your plan, you fix your plan and then you keep going. It doesn't matter so much that over
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.320]   the last week, I rarely changed my plan. That doesn't matter. What matters to me is what
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.280]   percentage of your work hours over the past week were spent working on things that you actually
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.920]   thought in advance about what you wanted to do and had chosen this intentionally as a good activity.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.920]   What is your intention hour ratio? That's what really matters. So if you get to in your plan,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   some sort of hard task and you're like, "I just can't get going on this. I don't have what I need.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:03.280]   I just, whatever. I'm resisting it brick wall. I don't have the energy." You say, "Okay,
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.040]   take a breather, fix the plans, go do something else. Not a big deal." Because what matters is
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.720]   that you keep coming back to intention, not that everything in your plan actually gets executed.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:20.080]   All right. So I think that's important. Let me give you a couple of tactical things here
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.680]   about the specific brick wall activities. So we have the big picture, punt on the idea,
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.880]   not on the system. Punt the task, not on the system. You're not trying to win a game. You're
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   trying to be intentional. But let's talk a little bit more about these really hard activities.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:40.480]   I'm going to give you two practical suggestions. One, softer entry. So if you have a really hard
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.920]   task that every time it comes up, it just paralyzes you. Like for me, this might be something like,
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.280]   here's a really tricky long form New Yorker piece that you've promised to write. It's hard to just
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.360]   sit down and be like, "Let's go." So I get it. Softer entry is often the way to do. Instead of
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:04.640]   scheduling on your calendar four hours to quote unquote, write a draft of this really hard article,
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:11.440]   you schedule one half hour to go for a walk somewhere scenic and just think about like,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.920]   "How am I going to do this article? How am I going to get into it? What's going to work here? What's
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.840]   not? What can I get excited about? What structure can I get excited about?" And there will be no
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.120]   actual writing during this session. It is just you thinking. And what happens if you don't really
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.160]   come up with any good ideas? Nothing. You get a nice walk for a half hour. That's a softer entry.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.200]   So you get to one of these pre-deep tasks, you'll do it. "Yeah, I got to go for a walk. This is an
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.240]   easy thing to do." And you know what's going to happen after five or 10 minutes? You are going
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.840]   to have some good ideas and you're going to be like, "Okay, here's a good opening. And what if
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.720]   I do this or that?" And now that you've had that preparatory period, when you next get to a bigger
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   block scheduled to do the hard thing, it's going to be much easier to start because it's not a cold
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.160]   start. You already have some preparation. So for the really hard things, give yourself some of
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:02.640]   these softer entry blocks first before you tackle the main event. The other thing to keep in mind is
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.880]   maybe you're procrastinating on these really hard tasks. I'm looking at your wording here,
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:15.040]   impenetrable brick wall tasks. Maybe you're having a hard time getting started because your brain is
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.640]   not on board with the plan. You have this task like, "All right, I am going to write my killer
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.080]   novel. Let's get going." And your brain is like, "Hey, buddy, you don't know how to do this."
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.720]   You can't just like load up Scrivener and start typing. No, this is stupid. It's going to be a
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.080]   waste of time. You haven't thought this through. You don't have a lot of information on how one
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.880]   succeeds in this. We don't have confidence that this is a first step towards many that will have
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.920]   a high probability of a good return. There's stuff you're not doing that you kind of know you need to,
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.200]   but as annoyance, you're avoiding it to do something else instead. I don't want to have
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.240]   anything to do with this. Hey, motivational center, turn off. So that could be going on as well.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.800]   Make sure your brain's on board, which means you really believe the thing you're doing that you're
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   struggling with is worth doing and that you believe you have a very good, effective plan
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:05.600]   for actually tackling it. So I put those two things in there. I think that'll help.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:12.080]   So just in terms of these specific tasks, soft entries, making sure you really should be doing
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:19.360]   the task that really matters. More philosophically, the system is not about winning the game. The
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.280]   system is about intention, and that should help you prevent from going back.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.880]   I'm going to riff on you a little bit here. One more piece of advice.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:35.200]   Get rid of that escapism as an option. Have better escapism activities. It's not going to help you
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.920]   start the activity. But when you find yourself seeking escapism,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:47.040]   don't do endless scrolling or videos. Have higher quality escapism. That alone won't solve your
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.240]   problem because when you get to the impenetrable task and you give up on your schedule, you're
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   going to go through escapism. But if you're a grown man, don't scroll videos. Make that escapism
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:04.480]   like I'm reading something. I'm going for a walk. I'm watching a movie. I needed a break last week,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.720]   and so I put aside two hours to finally watch Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.800]   Cool movie, by the way. Filmed it in natural light, Jesse.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.840]   Really?
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:19.520]   They used the fluorescence in the set. They built a fake bank, but on a real street in the warehouse.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.560]   Used the fluorescence as the lighting. They only had to augment the lighting during the scenes
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:30.400]   where the power went out. Natural lighting. Everyone was wearing their own wardrobe,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:35.760]   so it was all naturalism. It was all about naturalism. They told Pacino, "Wear your own
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:40.880]   clothes. Just wear your own clothes." Probably 50% of the dialogue was improvised.
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.280]   Really?
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:48.320]   Yeah. Great movie. Yeah. Interesting. Also, it's really cool, and Larry, I know you care about
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:56.240]   this. It's from the '70s. The actual plot that this bank robbery is turning on is very progressive
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:02.000]   for the time. What's really happening is Al Pacino is trying to get this money to pay for a sex
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.400]   change operation for his boyfriend who's in a mental institution. He's been hospitalized. This
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:15.360]   is out there stuff for the '70s. Lumet, because I just read a book. I just read Lumet's book,
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:21.280]   Making Movies. He talks a lot about this. He's very careful. You build this connection with
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.000]   Pacino. You don't know why he's robbing the bank until halfway through so that you have this
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.480]   connection with him. Then he wanted the 1970s audience to be okay with realizing the full scope
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.400]   of the story. If he had just opened with that, they would have put up walls. He'd call it the
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.080]   People in the Balcony. It would have been like, "Ah." But he builds up this connection over an
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.760]   hour, and then he layers on this new layer of psychological complexity. Now you're all in.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.560]   Anyway, it's a great movie. That's what I'm saying, Larry. Watch Dog Day Afternoon instead
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.720]   of scrolling videos, okay? If you're a grown man, enough of this. That's not going to solve
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.400]   your problem. All my other stuff is going to solve your problem of giving up on your system,
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:04.800]   but you also have this other problem of you need better escapism. I think of the compulsive
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:11.840]   scrolling is like the day drinking a little bit. It's like in the '60s, like, "Oh, man. This job
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.560]   runs me down. My life is hard. Can't we just have a couple more martinis and lunch?"
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.880]   In the moment, you're kind of getting away from bad feelings, but when you get to your
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.800]   kid's little league practice, you're pitching the ball into the stands because you can, etc.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:32.160]   All right. I'm going to tighten up here. It's a long answer, Larry. Let's move on. Let's do
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.920]   another one. What do we got here, Jesse? All right. We got Ramil. "How should I choose a
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.040]   project to boost my career capital? I currently have two choices. One I will surely enjoy at all
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.960]   times, but it's debated how much it will increase my career capital. The other will give me an
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.680]   almost immediate boost in my career capital, but I will hate doing it." Ooh, there's a dilemma.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:55.200]   Yeah. I was going to say, but this is not fair. So, Jesse, I was going to say at first, "Oh,
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.560]   this is one of those famous questions we get where they try to lead me to the answer."
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:10.480]   We're like, "Well, I could do this option. It would require ritual castration,
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:17.360]   and I would have to move to Bakersfield, California, and I would have to live under
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:25.520]   an oil derrick, so that's going to be going on. I'll probably be blinded by the acid fumes,
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:34.000]   but I could do that, or I could try to become a YouTube influencer and live a life of peace
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.520]   and happiness." But I don't know. What do you think I should do? We get a lot of those,
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:44.720]   but this is not quite that, because this is exact counterpoints. I think this is a true
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.120]   Prisoner's Dilemma game theory issue here, because he's saying option number one for his career
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:54.640]   will be good for his career, but he'll hate it. Option number two will not be good for his career,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:02.000]   but he'll love it. Actually, this is not him leading us. This is a well-balanced dilemma.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.920]   Here's what I'm going to say. First of all, I'm very wary of the activity that you say is not
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.960]   going to build career capital, but is fun. I tend to think about professional projects that are fun,
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.320]   but don't actually move the needle on the things that matter in your career.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.880]   You're just smuggling a hobby into your work. Let your hobbies be your hobbies. Have things you do
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.160]   just because they're really fun. In your work, you want to be simplifying, and with the time that
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:32.960]   remains, focusing as much as possible on things that really matter, unambiguously rare and valuable
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.680]   skills that you want to deploy and get better and better at. For those who don't know what he means
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:42.560]   when he says career capital, it's an idea from my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You. It's the
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:49.040]   metaphorical substance you acquire as you develop rarer and more valuable skills. It is the main
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:54.960]   leverage you have to make your job better. You invest your career capital into the things that
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.920]   make great jobs great. So if you don't get good at things, you can't expect a good job.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.720]   So I don't want to really waste my time, at least significant amounts of my time,
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.160]   on projects that don't help with that. If you want just fun stuff, you know, have a fun hobby.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   So that being said, let's look at this other option that will build your career capital,
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.800]   but you'll say you hate it. Here, it just depends on what your definition of hate is
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.080]   about what I'm going to recommend. If your definition of hate it is just, look,
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:26.000]   this is going to be hard. It's going to require deliberate practice to master the skills needed
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   to pull off this new project. In the end, I will have more career capital, but it's going to be
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.080]   hard. I don't want to do that hard work. I hate doing that type of hard work. Then I'm going to
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:40.800]   say do the hard work and just get more comfortable with that feeling of, oh, I'm straining myself to
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.320]   get here. Because that feeling of strain is how you get better and how you take control of your job.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.200]   On the other hand, if the reason why you hate it is more specific to the activity itself,
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.080]   the people are involved, you're like, I don't have anything to do with them,
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:00.000]   or the activity itself, I hate doing this type of thing. I'm an introvert. And this particular
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.040]   project is going to require me to like reach out and network and be super social. And I know I'm
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:10.640]   going to hate every minute of it. If it's intrinsic to the activity itself, clashing with you,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:17.360]   your personality, or your values, then don't do that activity. But also in that case, don't default
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.720]   back to the fun thing. Keep searching to find another good option. Keep searching for something
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.400]   else you can do that you're not going to hate, but will grow your career capital. I don't want
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:34.560]   you to give up, to take your eye off this prize of systematically building rare and valuable skills,
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.240]   because that's what's going to make your job good. It's what gives you leverage and options.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.960]   It's what's going to allow you to say, here's where I want to work, when I want to work,
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:46.320]   and what I want to work on. It's what allows you to say at 55, I'm going down to 30% time
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.520]   and moving to the white mountains because I'm really, really good. And the stuff I do is really
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.400]   valuable. And I have leverage in this marketplace. So don't give up building up leverage yet.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:05.040]   So don't do something just because it's fun, if it's not really going to help. On the same token,
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.440]   don't do something you hate, if you really, intrinsically, you hate it. But if you just hate
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.440]   the hard work of getting better, well, you got to get used to it. That's what it takes to do
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:21.200]   something deep. All right, rolling along. What do we got here next? We got Sammy. I quit my software
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:28.560]   sales job three years ago to pursue freelance B2B content, writing full-time. My goal was to get my
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:33.600]   rate high enough to work only three to four hours a day, leave me free to pursue my dream of writing
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.400]   fiction. I'm happy to say that I've reached the necessarily hourly rate to write every afternoon.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:43.120]   But after three hours of technical writing in the morning, I'm too drained to write fiction later in
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.880]   the day. Any advice? Well, Sammy, I'm glad you hit your goal that allows you to actually
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.560]   implement the schedule you envisioned, working three or four hours and then working on your
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:00.640]   novel. The step back, I don't recommend this path for other people. So again, going back to my book,
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:06.160]   So Good They Can't Ignore You, don't use the big change as your source of motivation to pursue a
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:11.040]   different project. Don't quit your job and say, because that'll motivate me to do better at this
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:17.440]   other job and so I can write full-time. Probably in this case, I would have suggested write while
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:25.920]   doing your sales job to really see, am I good at this? Can I sell a book? Sell a book first
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.360]   and then say, great, I know I can make a go at this. Now I'm going to reconfigure my job so I
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.080]   can do this with more time. I'm not a big believer in just like taking the huge leap because I think
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   people prioritize that momentary feeling of excitement and possibility of making the big
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.240]   change, but the big change might not have been the right idea. But okay, here you say it's fine.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:51.120]   Your new job is working out, you're making enough money, that's good. So you're having a hard time
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.280]   still writing. All right, I wrote down four ideas about how you might solve that. Number one, I
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:04.160]   think it's the obvious thing. Write your novel first, then do your freelance writing job. Start
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:11.440]   with the novel, then switch to the other thing. B2B content writing and for software, you don't
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:19.280]   need to have 100% going there, right? This is not Hemingway. It's not Lauren Groff needs to be
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.480]   writing these things. They have to carefully craft the freelance B2B software writing content to
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.280]   expose the human experience. So do the novel writing first. Maybe get up a little bit early.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:35.680]   I do that from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. and then get my day started with the other type of writing
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.800]   after a walk. That's obvious. Two, add more rituals and routines surrounding your fiction
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.680]   writing. So your issue here may be just the context switch. Sometimes when people think
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.720]   they're drained, what they're really feeling is just the immediate friction of my brain is in this
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:57.600]   context. It's freelance software writing. And when I wrench it away from that, and two minutes later,
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.560]   I'm like, "Let's get going on the novel." Your brain is saying, "I have none of the relevant
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:08.560]   stuff loaded up. I don't have the characters loaded up. I don't have the plot loaded up.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.200]   You're going to have to give me 15 or 20 minutes until I have switched my cognitive context from
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:18.880]   what we were doing before to what we're doing now." A lot of people experience that 10 to 20 minute
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:24.000]   switch of cognitive context as, "Oh, I'm drained. I can't do this. I guess my brain doesn't want to
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.320]   do it." What professional writers know is you just keep powering through. And after 20 minutes,
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.400]   why does it get easier? Because your brain has switched over all the context, and it's no longer
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.680]   pulling neuronal teeth that actually make progress on what you're doing. So it might just be you need
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:42.800]   to give it a little bit more time. A ritual and routine helps here. Okay, I'm going to go for a
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.840]   walk and make this coffee. I'm going to read my last pages and then walk through the woods for 20
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:52.720]   minutes and then come back and start writing. These types of rituals help you through the
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.440]   process of converting your cognitive context. It'll feel then less strain once you sit down
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:03.760]   at the keyboard. Number three, make sure your brain actually trusts you to write a novel.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.160]   We talked about this in our answer to a previous question in this episode.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.520]   But a lot of times why novelists get blocks is because their brain says,
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.200]   "You're not ready to be a novelist. You're just writing, but you don't really... I have no faith
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:22.080]   that you're producing something here that's going to be a sellable novel. You haven't talked to
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:26.160]   other novelists about how they got started. You have no way of evaluating what you're doing to
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   see if it's of the right caliber to even be considered. Hey, you haven't even looked into
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.320]   the process of what happens when this novel is over. Why aren't you joining a writer's group?
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.040]   Why don't you know about how agencies work? Why haven't you talked to two or three other people
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:44.400]   about how many books it took before?" Your brain might just say, "You just don't want to write.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.120]   You just like the idea that I write every day. You like the idea of being someone who published
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:53.760]   a book, but you haven't spent time figuring out what do I have to do to be that person."
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.560]   So make sure you've really convinced your brain that what you're doing with this writing
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.520]   has a good chance of succeeding. And if not, you need to go get that information. You got to
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.720]   convince your brain first, because otherwise it's going to turn off that motivational center.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   And you're going to read that as being drained. Because keep this in mind,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:21.280]   there are many well-known writers, especially in genres, genre writing, who get started writing
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:26.080]   in addition to a very busy full-time job. So the human brain is capable of doing this.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.720]   You're doing freelance writing three to four hours a day. You could still work on your novel.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:36.720]   In my new book, Slow Productivity, I have a whole thing about genre writers and when they wrote
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.280]   their first books. I talked about Stephanie Meyers writing the Twilight books. She was raising three
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.080]   young boys. So there's these little windows of time. That's a really hard job. I have three boys.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.880]   She was writing while doing that. John Grisham was writing while a lawyer and a member of the
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:56.240]   Mississippi State Legislature. You get up at 5 a.m. to put in those pages. Michael Crichton was
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:02.720]   writing while a med student. When he would get bored in class, he would just switch over to
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:10.240]   working on the novel that he was working on. We had Clive Kussler. So his wife took a job that
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:15.440]   had a night shift. So he had the kids at night. After he put the kids to bed, his wife wasn't
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.240]   there. He was bored. That's when he would write. He was an ad executive. He'd write late at night.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:26.800]   Robin Cook spent time writing in decompression chambers. He was a Navy diver after the Korean
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.720]   War doing experiments, early experiments with scuba. And so he would write and bring a typewriter
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.000]   into decompression chambers. He was a ship doctor on a submarine in the Navy for a while. He'd work
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.280]   on books down there. So it's not like you're coming up against some physical limit. So you
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.040]   really want to care about these other factors that are going on to see what's really going on here.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:52.880]   And finally, be okay going slow. Key idea from slow productivity. I'm doing this with another
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:58.640]   job. It's my first book. So maybe this takes me two years instead of six months. As long as you
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:06.480]   couple and steady with the word slow, you're okay. Keep the pace realistic. I think that'll be okay.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:12.000]   All right. I think we got time for one more question. Let's do one more here.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.720]   Okay. We got Todd. I'm a software engineer at a small tech company, and I have almost no meetings,
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.160]   a pull-based task management system, zero emails, and almost exclusively asynchronous
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:29.040]   communication through our project management tool. As a result, I can spend my entire day
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:34.320]   in a deep work state. Can there be too much deep work? Because to me, the entire ordeal feels
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.680]   dehumanizing. I'll tell you what, Jesse, for reasons that I will soon explain, I want to call
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:52.480]   this question our slow productivity corner of the day. All right. So as longtime listeners and
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.520]   watchers know, in celebration of my new book, Slow Productivity, that comes out on March 5th,
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.560]   I choose one question per episode to make my slow productivity corner question of the day.
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:08.400]   I choose a question that overlaps with ideas from my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:16.640]   If you want to get a free excerpt from that book, go to calnewport.com/slow to learn more.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:23.040]   All right. So why is this connected to slow productivity? Because this question is fantastic
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:30.240]   because it connects to the evolution of work in the 20th and 21st century and the problems with
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:37.680]   the way this evolution unfolded. So Todd is explaining from a systemic perspective, a
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:46.880]   perspective of systems, in my mind, a fantastic knowledge work structure, no meetings, poll-based
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.480]   task management. That's a big idea from slow productivity, but that's where you pull in the
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.320]   next thing you're going to work on when you're done with the current thing, as opposed to having
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:59.520]   anyone and everyone push work onto your plate that you then have to juggle or manage without
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.240]   having a say in it. Zero emails, almost exclusively asynchronous communication through project
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:09.040]   management tools, meaning you're not servicing back and forth email and chat conversations all
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:14.400]   day, which creates context switching. This is an ideal setup for a knowledge work job that's built
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.680]   on doing deep work like software engineering. So why is Todd dehumanized and miserable?
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:27.120]   It's because we have a mismatch here. We have a mismatch between the way we've learned to work
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:32.400]   and the reality of these better ways of working. So let me explain here. This is an idea from the
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.960]   first part of my book, Slow Productivity. In the first part, I say, how did we get to this place
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:43.280]   where we are very unhappy with the notion of productivity in knowledge work? And the story I
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:51.920]   tell is one of haphazardness and heuristics. So we have mid 20th century, it's 1959, the year that
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.440]   knowledge work is first coined as a term. This is the decade in which knowledge work emerges as a
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.000]   major economic sector, right? Not just, we have a few people in an office to support
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.240]   our iron foundry, but now we have just whole companies that do nothing but work in offices,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.000]   working with our brains. And a question arises, what does it mean to be productive in this new
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.680]   type of work? In the factories that were dominant in the economy until this point, it was really
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:25.440]   easy. Here's the stuff we produce. We produce Model Ts. We measure how many labor hours it
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.480]   requires for each Model T produced. If you give me a system for building Model Ts that reduces
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.080]   that number, I know it's a better system and we switch to it. Before industrialization,
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.280]   we had productivity clearly defined in agriculture. Here's how many bushels of wheat I get
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.360]   per acre of land. You change the system you use to rotate your crops, that number went up. That's
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:48.240]   a better system. Knowledge work just doesn't work anymore. We're not producing one thing.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.080]   Individual knowledge workers, and just reflect on your own life here,
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.480]   individual knowledge workers work on all sorts of things. Many different types of projects and
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:02.000]   many different types, some administrative, some more serious. There's no number to output the
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.240]   measure and put a number on and say this is up or down. These workloads are highly varied depending
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.720]   on what you happen to say yes to or not, or how many things were pushed your way. So you can't
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:20.320]   compare different people, apples to apples. And there's no clear system that everyone is following
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.120]   to organize and tackle their work. So it's not like we can say, hey, when we changed our
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.960]   productivity system from X to Y, we got more work done. So that's a better system.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.680]   No, in knowledge work, it's autonomous. Everyone comes up with their own techniques.
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.040]   It's up to you to figure out how to manage their work. So we had no systematic way of actually
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:43.280]   talking about productivity. So what do we do instead? We fell back on this heuristic called
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:52.880]   pseudoproductivity. Visible activity becomes a proxy for productive effort. If I see you doing
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:58.480]   stuff, that's better than me not seeing you do stuff. So as long as I see you're busy,
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.880]   then it's a good approximation as far as I'm concerned that you're being productive.
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.720]   I get into this in the book, but it's like, okay, and if we need more productivity,
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.120]   what we need is just more hours of work, just more busyness. It was just a bandaid. We didn't
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:14.080]   really know how to measure productivity in the office environment, so we came up with this
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:20.640]   heuristic, visible activity. That's productivity. We created what I call an invisible factory
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.600]   for knowledge work. We clock in at a certain time, we have to do stuff until a certain
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.320]   closing time, and then we kind of clock out and leave our office and go home.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:34.480]   We got very used to that. But here's the issue with the invisible factory pseudoproductivity
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:40.240]   model is that most of what we're doing is not actually moving the needle on things that matter.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.880]   Most of what we're doing is we're talking about work, we're having meetings, we're trading emails
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.360]   back and forth, we're on chat channels, we're trying to chime in quickly on chain so people
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.040]   know that we're there. The activities that show that you are active can be quite orthogonal to
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.280]   the activities that actually make a difference. So we're just filling our days with busyness,
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.880]   the administrative overhead surrounding overloaded schedules and to-do lists, and
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.360]   40-50% of what we're doing doesn't even really matter. So what happens then when we get back to
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:18.720]   Todd and we abandon pseudoproductivity and we abandon busyness as a proxy for productive
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.480]   effort and we get rid of the busyness through smarter systems, there's no more email chains
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.200]   you can endlessly respond to in five or six Zoom meetings a day, you can't hop on calls,
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.960]   you're an engineer program, make good programs. When you're done with this feature, tell us,
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.720]   you can pull in another one. So what happens when we get rid of all the busyness?
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.040]   The eight-hour day no longer makes sense. So much of our eight-hour day is filled with this sort of
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.120]   filler stuff that we can do endlessly, it's not too draining. When you get rid of all of that,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:52.960]   there's only so much deep work you can do. And we know this by studying what I call in my book,
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.800]   traditional knowledge workers. Let's go back and study people who traditionally made a living with
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:01.120]   their brain, but because of the time and their situation had a lot of autonomy to figure out
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.720]   how they wanted to work, you know, scientists and philosophers and novelists. And what do they do?
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:10.320]   They would work hard for three or four hours most, and that would be it. And then they're done doing
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.240]   that type of work. Novelists don't write for more than three hours a day. The best scientists can
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.280]   think about physics for a while, but they can't do it all day long. Shakespeare would write his
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.280]   plays, but not in eight-hour shifts. So the reality of a world without pseudoproductivity
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.960]   and performative busyness is that they try to sit for eight hours. The artificiality of that
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.720]   in the context of knowledge production becomes apparent. If all you're doing is really trying
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.160]   to create valuable stuff with your brain, sitting somewhere for eight hours is not the right way to
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.040]   do it. Traditionally, people who have done this never worked that way. So what you're experiencing,
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.400]   Todd, is when you get a better structure of work that gets rid of the performative busyness,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.120]   you're realizing the eight-hour workday doesn't match what you're doing.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.760]   So long story short, work less. If you have to obfuscate that, obfuscate that. Two hours,
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.440]   90-minute break, hour, two-hour break, another hour. If you need to spread it out in the day,
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.240]   do. If you don't, if you're entirely results-oriented, knock in four hours,
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.160]   get really good work done. And then with your other time, go do something else that's just
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.360]   as life-affirming and meaningful. Go back and listen to the first part of this episode where
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.480]   we talk about how to navigate the complex world of self-help information, reflect, reiterate,
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.040]   build, add, subtract, do all the stuff that makes a deep life deep. Think of it like you've won the
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.240]   lottery. You get to actually work the way that knowledge workers should be working.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.640]   So yes, to try to fit in eight hours of deep work all day long, that is dehumanizing because
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:47.040]   the human brain can't do that. The eight-hour day makes sense for factories. The eight-hour day
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.560]   makes sense for a pseudo productivity regime where we have no other way of
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.880]   knowing what you're doing. It does not make sense, however, if your real goal is just to produce the
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:00.640]   highest quality, best results using your brain. You have a chance to do that, Todd. So work less.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:08.560]   Was your coining of the invisible factory, did you use that for the first time in the upcoming book?
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.200]   I think so. I think so. The only reason why I'm saying I think so, it's possible
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.920]   and so my New Yorker writing, maybe I mentioned it, but I think I coined it in the book.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:27.600]   Chapter four. But I don't want to, it's possible. There's a particular New Yorker piece.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:34.320]   The New Yorker piece that overlaps this is I did one last year where I used anthropological
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:41.760]   research of extant hunter-gathering communities to try to understand what did work mean for humans
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.960]   for 300,000 years, like intelligence very recently. And how does that differ most from
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.680]   what knowledge workers do today? Because presumably where we have the biggest friction
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.000]   points between how we work today and how we evolved to work, we're going to find dissatisfaction.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.760]   And that's where we want to change how we work today. And all this, I elaborate this whole thing
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.480]   in the book, of course, but it started as a New Yorker article. And this pace thing was a big
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.640]   part of it. This idea of like working full intensity for the same amount of time every
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.440]   day year round is incredibly foreign to the human species. And that's where the invisible factory
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:17.200]   notion applies. I don't know if I coined it in that book. I mean, in that article or from the
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   book, but whatever. - I like the term a lot.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.960]   - Yeah, it's a cool term. The types of knowledge you will learn. See, I'm doing an ad here,
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.400]   Jesse. The type of knowledge you will learn when you read my book, Slow Productivity,
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.880]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment, Without Burnout. - Just do it again in your French voice.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   - For my French readers, it's the type of knowledge you shall learn
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:46.800]   when you read the Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment, Without Burnout,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:54.720]   available for pre-order, calnewport.com/slow. The French love slow productivity, by the way,
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   because they're already on board with this, right? Like the French think we're crazy in the US.
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:04.720]   Like, what are you guys doing? Like, look, you're not going to be Jeff Bezos, most of you, right?
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:10.320]   Like, I get it if you're like crushing it to make a billion dollars and have a yacht that can't fit
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.520]   under a bridge. Great. But they're like, what's up, man? You're like an HR manager. Like, you're
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.480]   not going to be Jeff Bezos. Why are you guys crushing it? You know? They're like, they should
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.360]   be drinking the wine. You know, we work, we work. But like, what are we going to work in the
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:29.920]   afternoon? I mean, the afternoon is when we drink the wine. What is going on here? So the French
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.640]   get it, man. The French are on board. The Americans, I have to convince. The Germans, I have
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:42.480]   to convince. Deep Work is like a big book in Germany. So like, yes, we shall. Yes, I'm boy,
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:48.080]   we work hard, work deeply. Yes. So I got to convince the Germans. I got to convince the
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:54.240]   Americans. The British, it's not, the British don't, they're neither. They work really hard
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.240]   or like really like to relax. They just don't trust Americans. So I have to kind of convince
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.760]   them, though actually my books do well over there, but they're like, I don't know.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.880]   How long have the British not trusted Americans for?
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.400]   I'm just thinking of the self-help category. They think we're all kind of
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:15.760]   boorish, you know? They're like, oh, cheerio. It seems a little brash, little brash. So sorry
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.920]   about this. Like the British and the Canadians are very worried about like tall poppy syndrome.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.280]   Who are you to be telling me like what to do? You know, it's so it's, it's interesting. Every
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.200]   culture has their thing. The U.S. is like, give me whatever. Let's go for it. Like let's though
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:35.840]   telling Americans to work slower. It's going to be interesting. Yeah, we'll see. That's why
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.720]   you got to pre-order this book so that you can help spread the word. All right. That's a slow
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:54.000]   productivity corner. Let's get some theme music. All right. Let's, um, do we have a call this week?
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.080]   Yep. All right. Let's do a call. All right. Hey, Cal. Longtime fan going back a decade plus.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.480]   As a fellow Dartmouth alum, I really appreciate what you're doing to elevate the
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:10.400]   visibility of our institution. So thanks for all that you do. I have a question for you relating
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.560]   to writing and productivity. I am currently in the midst of working with a writing coach
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.720]   who has been encouraging me to adapt my processes to kind of move the ball forward a little more
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.960]   effectively on some papers that I'm working on. There's one in particular where I'm not
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.160]   necessarily beholden to another team, but am intermittently chipping away at things when I
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.200]   have time. Unfortunately, it keeps winding up being a second or third on the bucket list and
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:42.480]   then competing priorities kind of overrule it. My coach is encouraging me rather than trying to
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:47.840]   slave away and find rocks in the schedule of large chunks of time where I can do some high
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.480]   quality writing to instead look for short intervals, short bursts, as short as, you know, five
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.840]   minutes, 15 minutes, things like that, and to do that with more frequency. I know in deep work you
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:04.000]   talk a little bit about different approaches and structures to being productive in this way. I find
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.560]   it really hard to kind of rev up for that, but I'm willing to give it a try and will plan to do this
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:12.320]   probably in the interim between submitting this and you answering the question. But I would just
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.880]   love to hear a little bit around your thoughts in terms of writing productivity. I know you tend to
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.960]   write every day, but it sounds like your chunks are actually pretty substantial on a daily basis.
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.040]   I'm currently at a point between family and other work demands where I don't know that I have the
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:29.600]   bandwidth to do that effectively right now. And I'd just love to hear your thoughts on
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:37.920]   the trade-offs or considerations in like micro chunks for focused deep work versus
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:42.400]   more of the macro chunks with lower frequency and the relative merits of both. Thanks very much.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.360]   Well, always happy to give advice to a fellow Dartmouth man. You're the crazy Jesse because
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.040]   you're the same age, you're in the same place, same boat here. We're going back to Dartmouth
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.880]   this summer. For your 20th anniversary. 20th anniversary. I was getting a lot of emails,
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:05.680]   I haven't responded. It's kind of crazy. Kind of crazy. 20th anniversary. There was a book,
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.640]   there's a book that was big when I was in grad school. It reminds me of this
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.360]   question. It was, I think it was called writing your dissertation in 15 minutes a day.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   Like that was the theory of this book. Hey, 15 minutes a day, that's not so bad. But if you
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.000]   really do the math, this adds up to a lot of writing. It was similar to that really popular
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.120]   financial advice in the early 2000s, the latte effect. If you just don't buy one latte every
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:39.280]   day, just don't buy your latte. That's $3 a day. Well, that's going to be, you know, $20 a week,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:46.160]   but you know, $20 a week is going to be $80 a month, which is going to be almost $900 a year.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:54.400]   And if we have that $900 a year and we put interest over 20 years, you're going to have
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:00.320]   $15,000 or like whatever it is, right? That just little stuff adds up. It's definitely compelling.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:06.080]   That's not going to work. It's not going to work for difficult writing. It's not going to work for
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.640]   scholarly writing. The problem is, is you need about 15 or 20 minutes just to fully load up all
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:16.000]   of the context, all the cognitive context in your brain. Until then, you're not even really ready to
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   write anything of any substance. I mean, I would say you need 15 or 20 minutes of a startup ritual
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.320]   before you even start writing. And then you want to write 90 minutes minimum.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:33.040]   You really need 90 minutes minimum to produce enough that it was worth all the cognitive
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   startup work you had to do to get rolling. If this paper is important to you, find the time,
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.760]   block it off, and deal with the consequences later. So I'm just going to make this happen.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:48.320]   Three days a week, I can do this first thing and I'm going to do it for two hours or 90 minutes,
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.120]   and I'm just going to have to make that happen. I can't have other meetings scheduled here at work,
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:57.200]   and I'm just going to make it happen. And I'm going to give it its attention. I'm going to
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.120]   finish it, and then I'll free up those blocks. You know what? Nothing terrible will happen,
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.520]   almost certainly. And maybe it's I have to get up early. I talked about this in deep work.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.360]   Brian, who I actually just talked to the other day, keep in touch, but I had this example of Brian
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.360]   working on a dissertation while he was doing full-time teaching and other types of stuff.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.400]   He did it in the morning. He had this real ritual around it. Read that chapter,
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:25.200]   went to his basement, had this really set ritual around an exact cup of coffee made at the exact
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   time just to get his mind in the writing mode every day. He did the sort of 5 a.m. thing and
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   got it done. I'll sometimes do afternoon or evening blocks when I have a big deadline. I got
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.280]   to get this chapter done, or I really need to crack. Let's say I'm trying to crack a New Yorker
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.440]   piece, and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels. I'll sometimes just arrange with my wife, like,
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:50.320]   "Look, I'm going to do 4 to 6.30, and I'll probably go to the coffee shop right there just to get into
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.160]   the writing mode and then go to my office here and right here." And it's just a way of thinking
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.640]   through, like, here's a special time I can deploy that's really for pushing it. But make the time
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.880]   and do it. You have it. I mean, think about this. If you, God forbid, fell and broke your arm,
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.040]   let's just say that happened. You have a busy job. You have a busy family. What's going to happen?
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.120]   The doctor's going to say, "You got to do PT. You got to do PT for 6 weeks. You're going to lose
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.280]   mobility in your arm. You have to come to this place. You're doing it 3 days a week. It takes
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.200]   a couple hours. It's a pain, but you wouldn't lose your job, and your family wouldn't abandon
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.240]   you because you would work around it. You'd cancel some things. You'd work a little later.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.520]   You'd make it happen. That's what you got to do if this writing is important to you.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:36.160]   Give it 90-minute-plus blocks. Do the fixed-schedule productivity thing. Work around it.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.720]   Make the changes you need to make. Focus. Use rituals to get your mind really going,
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.040]   and then just get into it and write. And don't think about it as a scary thing.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.800]   It's just your job. That's what you do, right? Your job requires you to write papers. You're
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.160]   going to write papers. That's part of the job. It's the way I think about writing. It's my job.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.440]   It's like a football player doesn't say, "I hate the running and the weightlifting stuff.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.760]   That's so hard." That's the job of being a football player is that you're able and
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:09.040]   willing to do that, and other people aren't. So don't do that many. Give yourself more time.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.680]   Trust yourself and your organizational abilities for you to keep your job.
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:19.920]   It's possible. I think you'll be okay. All right. I'm going to do a quick case study.
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.560]   I like to do these when possible. It's when someone sends in a more detailed account of
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.360]   using some of the ideas from the show. This one, I might need your help here, Jesse. This one's
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.480]   a complicated one. It's a particular system someone built. I don't know that I fully understand it,
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.520]   but people like when we sometimes get into the really complicated systems people build.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.400]   So let's try one of those, and we'll see if we can figure this one out together.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:49.760]   So this system was sent in by someone named Cage, who said, "I study international business with a
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:54.400]   minor in economics. I bought How to Become a Straight-A Student and Deep Work, reading the
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.120]   former multiple times over. One thing I would like to highlight is the benefit I've found in
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.280]   the quantification of goals in regards to their estimated time. I've created a task planner in
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.920]   Excel that I will readily admit is both over-engineered and integral to my daily life."
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.880]   All right. So here's the description of his daily planner spreadsheet.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:24.320]   It contains rows for all of my projects. The first column is the day I put it into the planner.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:32.480]   The second is the project name. The third is the due date. The fourth is the days left,
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.840]   so the current date minus the due date. I think he has that backwards. It should be the due date
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:44.720]   minus the current date. The fifth column is the class or job function the project is for.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.040]   The sixth column is the estimated time it will take. The seventh column is the percentage complete.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:58.880]   The eighth column is the time left in the project. Here he gives an equation. It's the estimated time
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:06.960]   minus the estimated time times percentage complete. Okay. So if he's saying it's 10
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.120]   hours to do this, it's my estimate and I've finished 50% of the project, I'll subtract
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.680]   50% of the total time and get five hours left. And the ninth column is the time left per day.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.440]   This is the one that was confusing me, Jesse. Time left divided by days left.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:27.200]   That's the one that's confusing me. >> Time left, hours left.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.840]   >> So the equation he has here is time left divided by days left.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.240]   >> Yeah. >> He says the time left per day.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:42.320]   Oh, okay. Maybe it's just the... I get it. So the eighth column is the time left in the project. So
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:48.560]   how much of the estimated time is left? And the ninth column is saying, if you spread this work
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.720]   out evenly over the days that remain till the deadline, here's how much you'd have to do per
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.960]   day. Okay. All right. I get that. All right. Going on. When I designed this system, I had no idea how
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:06.240]   much the estimated time and time left per day would change my work. Though not perfect, I can usually
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.480]   guess within an hour how extensive a project is going to be. Through this system, I'm able to flag
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:17.760]   projects due in a day, and with the exception of those, tackle problems based on time left per day.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.080]   This keeps big research papers from distracting me from smaller projects that are coming up fast,
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.560]   while still allowing me to ensure I attack them in a timely manner without procrastinating.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:32.000]   This triaging has been essential to my life, and now this Excel project has essentially become my
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.400]   time block planner. Additionally, I can see exactly how many hours per day I have of work in total,
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.920]   how many projects I have open in the semester, how many I've completed, and much more.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:49.920]   I bring this up because I think this sort of quantification allows for major stress reduction,
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.760]   preventing anything from creeping up. Additionally, as I sit here, I see 65 completed
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.000]   assignments totaling 200 plus hours of work, just from the past semester. To see this, it truly
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.640]   reinforces the idea of slow productivity. Since implementing this system, I have never felt like
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.600]   I'm scrambling. Instead, I feel like I'm comfortably plodding along as new problems arise.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:18.240]   And that's pretty cool. I mean, right away, Jesse, he doesn't say, oh, he did say business
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:25.280]   administration. I was going to say, if he didn't say with an economics. If he didn't say that,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.600]   I think we could guess that he was in some sort of economics or science or engineering
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:37.600]   as his discipline. This is not the type of system. You're not going to see a system like this
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:44.640]   explaining your nine-column spreadsheet with all these equations. And at the end of it, it's like,
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.520]   and this is how I've organized my life, signed Maya Angelou. You know what I mean?
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:58.720]   There's certain types of jobs. There's certain types of jobs. This is not a poet from the West
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:06.400]   Village that's writing this system. This is an engineer. Let's be honest. Yeah, this is right.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.360]   I like it. I like it. So there's a broader point there I want to emphasize, if his nine-column
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:15.680]   spreadsheet's intimidating. And not to keep bringing everything back to the book Slow
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.480]   Productivity, but it's another thing I talk about in that book, is time quantification.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:27.360]   Time quantification as not a permanent discipline, but actually as an exercise you can go through.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.360]   So for a certain amount of time, so you don't have to worry that this is permanent,
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:37.520]   but for a certain amount of time, you do like what Cage does. And when you accept something
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.880]   on your plate, you figure out how long is this going to take? And even more so, you start to
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:47.120]   figure out where is this time going to come from? So one of the suggestions in my book, which is,
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.800]   gets at the same idea but a little bit more lightweight, is for a while what you do is,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   every time you are about to agree to a commitment, you figure out how long it's going to take,
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.320]   and you go and you find that time on your calendar and mark it off.
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:10.160]   So you're forcing yourself to actually confront the real time demands. It's easy to say yes.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.920]   It's just as easy to say yes as something that will take you 10 minutes as something that will
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:19.200]   take you 100 hours. It doesn't take long, it's three letters. But the impact there is different.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:23.920]   So if you take everything you're saying yes to, and before you say yes, you go and find the time
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.920]   and block it off. A couple things happen. One, you have to confront the reality of how long things
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:35.040]   take and what your schedule looks like. So you might say, wait a second, this project is going
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:40.160]   to take 20 hours. I can do this over like four sessions. I can't really find time for these
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.640]   sessions for another month and a half. Now you have realistic timeline, you can say, okay, I can
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.520]   do this. But I don't have time for this. I'm looking at this, it's going to be six weeks
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.160]   till I get going. So it allows you to be more realistic about your timelines. It also allows
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.360]   you to be more realistic about your workload. When you're trying to fit this in, it's stretching you
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.040]   the hell out. Like, I don't have time for this. I'm gonna have to go six months in the future.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:09.840]   Now you can say with confidence, yeah, I can't do this. I just don't have time. Because you're
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:15.600]   not just going off a gut feeling, you're going off of a realistic assessment of what your schedule
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.800]   looks like. And finally, you're protecting time for these things. So when you do commit to them,
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.760]   you know it'll get done because the time has been protected. So it's a good system.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.640]   Now it's heavy handed and it's annoying. So you don't want to do it all the time. But what happens
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.640]   is if you do this for like a few months, you build a good instinct for how long do things take? How
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:40.240]   busy am I right now? And you're able to do this triage much more quickly once you get a little
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:46.800]   bit more sophisticated. All right, good case study. So I want to move on now to our final
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.920]   segment. But before we do, I want to mention another sponsor that makes this show possible.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:03.200]   So the show is sponsored by BetterHelp. This is a tough time of year. I think from a mental
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:09.840]   health perspective, winter, the excitement of the holidays is gone. It's dark. It's cold.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:16.640]   You feel as far as you've ever been from summer and the changes and vacations. So it's a good
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:24.480]   time to think about your mental health. If you find yourself lost in ruminations or negative
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.120]   thoughts or a hedonic feelings where you can't feel hope or excitement about things,
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:36.160]   this is a problem that requires professional help to solve. And therapy could be exactly that help.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.880]   This is where BetterHelp enters the scene because it makes the process of getting started with
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:49.520]   therapy easy. It's entirely online. It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.760]   schedule. All you have to do is fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:02.960]   therapist. You can switch therapists at any time for no additional charge. So nothing about our
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:09.280]   notion of the deep life is going to work. If your relationship with your own brain is strained,
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.600]   therapy will help you. BetterHelp is an easy way to get involved.

[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.840]   Also want to talk about our friends at Shopify. Whether you're selling a little or a lot,
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:50.000]   Shopify helps you do your thing. However, you cha-ching. And a little saying I thought of,
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   Jesse. I don't know. I was just riffing. And the fact that there are sound effects there,
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.600]   you know, I just had the sound. I just had a cash register right here. I'm just riffing.
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:03.200]   However, you cha-ching. Here's the thing about Shopify. If you're going to sell something,
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.240]   especially if you're going to sell something online, you just go to Shopify. It's a no brainer.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:12.400]   It's like, oh, I want to search for something. You go to Google. I want to sell something online.

[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:03.360]   Jesse, to our final segment. Because it's the first episode of a new month, I like to review
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:09.120]   briefly the books I read in the month previous. That means I will be reviewing the books I read
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:15.840]   in January 2024. I usually strive to read five books per month. In January, actually, Jesse,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:21.040]   I read six because, you know, you get started in the Christmas break and I think there's at
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.200]   least one or two in there maybe I finished in January. I count books when I finished them,
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.880]   so, you know, I got some reading done. All right, so it's an interesting mix.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:37.600]   Book number one was The Shepherd's Life by James Rebanks. Classic, classic book. I think it's like
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:44.160]   15 years old now. Classic book in the deep life literature. I've heard many people mention it.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.720]   It's written by a shepherd, a shepherd in England that does fell shepherding where you keep the
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:58.720]   sheep in the valley, but the grazing lands up in the hilltops is public, and so it's shared lands.
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:03.360]   Beautifully written book, really beautifully written book about life as a shepherd.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:07.920]   So as I was going through this book, I was like, "Wow, this guy, this must be like a savant.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.640]   He's like a fantastic poetic writer and he's a shepherd." Well, about two-thirds of the way
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:20.080]   through the book, you realize he is a savant. He grows up on a farm, but gets a scholarship to
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.600]   Oxford. So actually, you don't realize this until you're well into the book. James Rebanks goes to
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:31.760]   Oxford, gets a classical education, gets an office job, says, "This stinks," goes back to becoming a
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.440]   shepherd. So it's this interesting mix of a classical education, but this interesting life
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.440]   is in agriculture. And so he writes beautifully about it. It's a great book. Really recommend it.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.160]   Won all the awards when it came out. Definitely worth reading.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:53.680]   Then I read The Man from the Future by Ananyo Bhattacharya. This is a biography of Jean von
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:01.040]   Neumann, one of the smartest people who ever lived. Huge figure in 20th century physics and
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.200]   mathematics and computer science. Yes, I listed all three different fields because he was big in
[01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:12.400]   all of these fields. In that world of the Manhattan Project, which he was involved in,
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:19.120]   and the U.S. physics revolution as it picked up steam going into the '40s and '50s, in that whole
[01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:24.880]   world, he was considered this huge brain. He was the guy who could walk in, solve the equation on
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:29.840]   the chalkboard, walk out, and on his way out, build a computer. So anyways, if you don't know
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:38.320]   Jean von Neumann, you should. Incredible polymath, brilliant guy. And this book was really good. It
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.080]   really covers it well. What I liked about this book, it's a serious science writer. He gets the
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:48.400]   science and math right. So there's multiple fields that von Neumann was involved in that overlaps my
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.760]   own training as a professor. And I can say Bhattacharya got this right. So he goes deeper
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:58.240]   on the science and math than you sometimes get in these science biographies. So I really love
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:04.000]   this book. I'm a big von Neumann fan. If you like Richard Feynman, for example, you should
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   read von Neumann. If you're interested in Turing, you should read von Neumann. He was deeply involved
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:14.800]   in both of their lives. Great book. "The Man from the Future." Going the other way, I read "The
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:19.200]   Pelican Brief" by John Grisham. I realized, I don't know if I'd ever read that before. And it
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:26.720]   was fine. I don't know. I've been rereading some Grisham recently. It was fine. It's a reasonable,
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:36.000]   serviceable thriller, I would say. Then I read "If You Could Live Anywhere" by Melody Warnick.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.760]   I like the premise of the book. If we go back to the categories from the beginning of this episode,
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:49.280]   this is classic self-help advice. And the book is about, in a world of remote work,
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:53.200]   you have a lot of options about where you could live. So how do you figure out where to live?
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:59.200]   That's a good premise. It's very advice-y, very checklist advice-y. Think about this. Build a
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:04.240]   spreadsheet. So it's like a very pragmatic book. She wrote another book before this that I'm
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:09.840]   interested in reading, which was, "How Do You Learn to Love Where You Are Living?" So she wrote
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:14.560]   that pre-pandemic. I might go back and check that book out because I think it has more of her
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:18.240]   personal story, which sounds interesting to me. They moved to a small town. I think it's in
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:22.640]   Virginia. Maybe it was in North Carolina. Maybe it was in Tennessee. Actually, I clearly have no
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:28.080]   idea where this town was. But she moved into some small town. And the book is about how she learned
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:33.600]   to love this town. So how do you love the place you are? You get involved and learn to love it,
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.880]   as opposed to always looking and thinking about what place could be better. So that book,
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.680]   which preceded this one, sounds interesting too. I just haven't read it yet.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:50.480]   Then I read "Man's Quest for God" by Abraham Joshua Heschel. It's a book about prayer.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:59.680]   A book about prayer coming at it from the Jewish perspective. The thing about Heschel,
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:07.680]   I don't know if the audience knows much about Heschel. A German-Jewish theologian and scholar
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:14.960]   brought over, essentially rescued from Germany at the last possible minute before the door slammed
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:20.400]   shut for Jews in Germany under the reign of Hitler. Comes to the U.S., doesn't speak any
[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:28.160]   English, becomes a great theologian and scholar in the U.S. His style, the thing about Heschel,
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:33.760]   and he's one of the best-known Jewish thinkers of the 20th century, marched with Martin Luther
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:42.560]   King, really interesting figure. The thing about his style is he has two things he's mixing.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:47.280]   So there's a scholarly aspect to him because he's a scholar, right? Like systematically,
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:52.320]   let's break this down and think about it and here's the framework and what have other people
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:58.080]   said about this and let's cite things. He's also very poetic. So he's a poetic writer.
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:04.080]   And so when he's writing about religion, he will mix sometimes a very scholarly style,
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:10.640]   but also he'll also be poetic. Like I want the poetic nature of my words to convey information,
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:16.080]   also my scholarly structures and information. "Man's Quest for God" really mixes these two
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:20.720]   together. It's kind of interesting. So there'll be these like long poetic statements, as well as
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:26.960]   like very systematic conversations. This book's from the 1950s about the emerging role of symbolism
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.120]   and modernism and reconceptualizing religious thought. And it's like, it's all mixed together.
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.160]   So it's not quick reading, but I thought it was really interesting. It's a really interesting
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.920]   take on prayer, especially the Jewish approach to prayer, which is halakic,
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:50.000]   meaning it's very structured, ritualized. Islamic prayer is very similar to this,
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:57.760]   as opposed to more of a ad hoc petitionary prayer, personalized prayer style. It's just
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:03.680]   when I feel moved, I try to connect to the divine. The Jewish, and I think Islamic style,
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.640]   it's much more structured. And they think that actually you're going to, in the end, get more
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.520]   intimations of the divine and insight by building structure around the activity. And he gets into
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.280]   all that. So if you're interested in that type of theology, it's a good book, but it's hard going
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:23.680]   because again, it's semi-academic, semi-academic, semi-poetic, semi-accessible.
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.160]   >> So that was probably one of your expert primary source.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:32.000]   >> That's an expert primary source. Yeah. Yeah. I just been finishing up another Heschel book
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.520]   that I think is more accessible. So we'll talk about that next month, but I would call it an
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:42.640]   accessible primary source. This kind of accessible, I've read other Heschel, I've read other theology.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:51.760]   So yeah, maybe it's expert. Finally, I read Palestine 1936 by Oren Kessler. Part of my
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:58.160]   ongoing efforts to self-educate about that part of the world. So Palestine 1936 is about
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:05.440]   the big uprising. I think it was called the great uprising that occurred under British imperial role
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:12.480]   of mandate Palestine in the 1930s, 1936. That's why it's in there. The argument of the author
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.280]   here is that that's really the birth of Palestinian nationalism. Like you can't
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.320]   understand Palestinian nationalism without understanding what was happening under British
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:28.480]   rule. And this first revolt that occurred in the thirties, that this really galvanized a lot of the
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:37.440]   structures and thinking and fault lines on which the whole rest of the 20th century
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:41.920]   conflict in there played out along. So you have to go back. You can't start with 1948.
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:46.160]   You got to go back to the 1930s to really understand what's going on.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:54.880]   Now, Jesse, I felt for this author personally, because he tells the story early in the book
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:02.400]   that he comes across this topic. He's like, no one's written about this. So I'm going to take
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:06.800]   on this book project because he can read the Arabic. He could read the Hebrew. There's not a
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.880]   lot in English. So it's a hard project, three-year project. I'm going to take this on. He gets going
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.440]   in the book. He's deep into the research process. Two books on the topic are announced after years.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:21.360]   There's some book in Hebrew and that's it. He's like, all right, I'm going to cover this. It's
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:27.120]   going to be great. He gets into the project. Two books are announced after he starts. But they were
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.200]   both very scholarly books. So I don't think they really stepped on his toes, but that's like classic
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:43.520]   writer's kismet. But anyways, it's a difficult research challenge that I think he did a very
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:49.520]   good job on because the sources here, you have to contextually understand early 20th century
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.520]   Arabic sources. You have to contextually understand early 20th century Jewish sources.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.040]   These are different languages, different contexts. And he does. And he pulls it together.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:06.720]   And I think does a pretty good job of talking about this period. And it's also just an
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.920]   interesting period. I mean, everything going on now is all about Britain's promises and changing
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:19.440]   promises for that area. And so Britain comes in. We don't have to go into the whole history of the
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.560]   middle East, but when Britain takes that over after they beat the Ottoman empire in world war one,
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:27.680]   they have this declaration where they say, okay, we're going to take this over.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.400]   We'll call this mandate Palestine. And part of the goal here is we're going to establish a Jewish
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:38.560]   state. And then they kind of come back from that. Like, actually, maybe, maybe we don't want to do
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:41.920]   that. And then they changed their mind again. Like, no, no, we do want to do that. And it
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:46.160]   was in response to that second. No, we definitely do want to do this. That caused the great uprising,
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:52.480]   the, the, the 1936 uprising. So there's like this negotiation back and forth. Britain was
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:56.080]   basically using that region as a pawn. I mean, a lot of their interest had to do,
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.360]   like, why did they, as they got closer to 1936, why were they saying,
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:03.920]   why were they going back and forth on this as they were trying to set things up for this
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:08.400]   impending world war two and where they're going to need Arab support. It's like a very complicated
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.680]   political picture. And I think the book does a good job of capturing what's going on there.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.240]   So I think that's useful. I mean, obviously there's other, there's,
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.760]   you're going to put a lot of emphasis on whatever you write about. So Kessler puts a lot of emphasis
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:28.880]   on 1936. And this did seem like an important period, but obviously there's other really
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:33.920]   important things that happened subsequently that you need to understand Palestinian nationalism.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:41.440]   I mean, like you really do need to understand Algeria and the, that decolonial movement in
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:47.680]   Algeria and how that influenced Yasser Arafat. And there's a lot of other things, especially in
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:53.120]   the sixties, I think that happened that were just as important for understanding like modern
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:57.520]   Palestinian nationalism. It's, you know, so it's not the full picture, but when you write these
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:01.680]   books, you, you, you know, it's always my thing I'm writing about was the key, but I could follow
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.280]   it. I could follow it. So I thought it was a good, good history book. Well researched.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.840]   So, you know, complicated. You got to speak a lot of languages to write about. If I ever became a
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:17.440]   historian, this is what I've learned. You want to focus on a topic that is in your language and
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:21.440]   from like close to your time period. So you just understand that you understand the language,
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.800]   understand the context already makes things easier. All right. Anyways, that's probably
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.520]   enough time for today. Thank you everyone for listening or watching the show. We'll be back
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.880]   next week with another episode and until then, as always stay deep. So if you liked today's
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:45.120]   discussion of reading self-help, you'll also like episode 278, which is about how to think about
[01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:49.760]   hard topics, how to make use of all those big ideas that you're going to encounter in your reading.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:58.000]   So check that out. So today I want to talk about one of the most important skills you can have as
