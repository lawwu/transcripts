[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   And so I think that we are going to digitize ourselves and give us digital immortality.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.980]   We'll not only have biologic genetic immortality of some sort, but also digital immortality.
[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.960]   And what are we going to do with it?
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.940]   I think we should send it into outer space.
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.640]   If you digitize the human brain and put it on a laser beam and shoot it to the moon,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   you're on the moon in one second.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.000]   Shoot it to Mars, you're on Mars in 20 minutes.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.840]   Shoot it to Pluto, you're on Pluto in eight hours.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.140]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.320]   You can have breakfast in New York and for a morning snack, vacation on the moon, then
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.560]   zap your way to Mars by noontime, journey to the asteroid belt in the afternoon, and
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.120]   then come back for dinner in New York at night.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.440]   All in a day's work.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100]   At the speed of light.
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.680]   Now this means that you don't need booster rockets, you don't need weightlessness problems,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.720]   you don't need to worry about meteorites.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.400]   And what's on the moon?
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.100]   On the moon, there is a mainframe that downloads your laser beam's information.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.960]   And where does it download the information into?
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960]   An avatar.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.040]   And what does that avatar look like?
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.000]   Anything you want.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Think about it for a moment.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.140]   You could be Superman, Superwoman, on the moon, on Mars, traveling throughout the universe
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.200]   at the speed of light, downloading your personality into any vehicle you want.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.160]   Now let me stick my neck out.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.840]   So far everything I've been saying is well within the laws of physics.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.440]   Well within the laws of physics.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.640]   Now let me go outside the laws of physics again.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.640]   Here we go.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.680]   I think this already exists.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.600]   I think outside the earth there could be a superhighway, a laser highway, of laser porting
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.840]   with billions of souls of aliens zapping their way across the galaxy.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.600]   Now let me ask you a question.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   Are we smart enough to determine whether such a thing exists or not?
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.200]   No.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   This could exist right outside the orbit of the planet earth.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.720]   And we're too stupid in our technology to even prove it or disprove it.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:28.600]   We would need the aliens on this laser superhighway to help us out, to send us a human interpretable
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   signal.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.720]   I mean, it ultimately boils down to the language of communication, but that's an exciting possibility
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.920]   that actually the sky is filled with aliens.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.840]   It could already be here and we're just so oblivious that we're too stupid to know it.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.640]   See, they don't have to be in alien form with little green men.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.760]   They can be in any form they want, in an avatar of their creation.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.920]   Well, in fact, they could very well be-
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.320]   They could even look like us.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   Exactly.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   We'd never know.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.160]   One of us could be an alien.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.280]   You know, in the zoo, did you know that we sometimes have zookeepers that imitate animals?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   We create a fake animal and we put it in so that the animal is not afraid of this fake
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   animal.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.960]   And of course, these animals' brains, their brain is about as big as a walnut.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.640]   They accept these dummies as if they were real.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.400]   So an alien civilization in outer space would say, "Oh yeah, human brains are so tiny.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.600]   We could put a dummy on their world, an avatar, and they'd never know it."
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.280]   That would be an entertaining thing to watch from the alien perspective.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   You
