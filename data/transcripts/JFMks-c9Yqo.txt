[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Does God want me to be happy or holy?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   It's a common question and Josh, a listener, writes in to ask it.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Pastor John, my pastor who knows and loves the gospel, chose this as his main point of a recent sermon.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   God desires our obedience more than our happiness.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Now, to me, this feels very much like law and not gospel.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   He did explain this as trusting him and obeying him, even in hardships.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   But doesn't the gospel do more? Doesn't it give us happiness in obeying him?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   What would you say, Pastor John?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   I remember 40 years ago when I was teaching at Bethel College, I had two colleagues, Art Lewis and Al Glenn.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I don't think they'd mind my saying this.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   And they had a friendly controversy going on.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   They would pass each other in the hall.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I'd watch this happen several times and laugh.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   They would pass each other in the hall and one, I won't even say which one said which,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   one said to the other, "Love Jesus!"
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And the other would say back, "Obey Jesus!"
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   And they really did have a little controversy about where the note should be struck.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And my guess is that all of us need some correcting from time to time.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I mean, I fear that sometimes.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I can get on a roll with a truth that I love and talk about it for weeks and weeks and realize,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   you know, there's some things that are going unsaid that need to be said,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   or what I'm saying is going to get bent out of shape.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I would want to be very careful before I pass any judgment on this pastor for the sentence,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   "God desires our obedience more than our happiness."
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   My first agenda would be, as people might guess, "What do you mean by happiness?"
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Because my guess is he means something that probably would mean I would agree with him.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So, for example, suppose he says, "What if he means God desires you to deny yourself that pornography
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   more than he desires you to have the pleasure you will get from looking at it?"
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   And if that's what he means, I agree with him.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Or, "What if he means God desires you to stay in that conflicted marriage more than he desires for you
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   to enjoy the relief you would feel after you get a divorce?"
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   If that's what he means, I would agree with him.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Or, "What if he means God desires you to get up off the couch and play with your children
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   when you are tired more than he desires for you to have the pleasure of resting while you neglect your children?"
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And if that's what he means, when he says, "God desires your obedience more than your happiness," I agree with him.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   So I must be careful, and we must all be careful not to jump to judgment without defining terms.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But I do totally empathize with Josh's concern if that's the only way his pastor talks about happiness
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   in relation to obedience.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I think if he does only talk that way, he's going to create a biblically false picture of the gospel
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   and of the Christian life.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Just this morning, I was studying John 17 in my personal devotions, and I read this.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Jesus said, "These things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I have given them your word, and the world hated them because they are not of the world."
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So, "I speak to you, and great joy fills you. I speak to you, and great hatred comes against you."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   In two sentences, back to back.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   In other words, Jesus intends for us, in the very acts of obedience that bring down the hatred of the world,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   to be happy, to be fully happy in him, that his joy would rule in our hearts.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And I know that many people use the word "joy" and "happiness" as different experiences.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Happiness is superficial and based on circumstances. Joy is deep and based on Jesus.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   And, of course, there is such a thing as superficial happiness, and there is such a thing as deep and unshakable joy,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   but that distinction in the words won't hold up in the Bible.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The Bible doesn't have a word for superficial happiness and non-superficial joy.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They all flow into each other.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   All the words for joy and happiness and gladness and rejoicing and pleasure and delight,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   they're all used both ways in the Bible.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   They're used superficially, and they're used deeply.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You can't carve it up that way.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   We must simply make clear at every point, "What does the Bible mean, and what do we mean in our preaching?"
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The main reason I don't like the sentence, "God desires our obedience more than our happiness,"
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   is that God commands us to be happy.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And, therefore, obedience to that command is happiness and can't be the opposite of happiness.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   It's a category confusion to juxtapose and oppose happiness and obedience when happiness is commanded.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   When happiness is commanded, happiness is obedience.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   So the Bible says, "Delight yourself in the Lord," Psalm 37:4.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The Bible says, "Be glad in the Lord," Psalm 32:11.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   The Bible says, "Rejoice in the Lord," Philippians 3:1.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   The Bible says, "Rejoice always," 1 Thessalonians 5:16.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The Bible says, "Do your acts of mercy with cheerfulness," Romans 12:8.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   The Bible says, "Serve the Lord with gladness," Psalm 100, verse 2.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So it can be very misleading, at best, to say, "God desires your obedience more than your happiness,"
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   because obedience to these commands is happiness.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Bingo. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   And for more on this connection, see episode number 13, "The Essential Warfare for Holiness,"
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   which continues this discussion on the connection between happiness and holiness.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   To be perfectly holy would to be fully happy.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And we are going to break for the weekend.
