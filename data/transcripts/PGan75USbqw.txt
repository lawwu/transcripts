[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   So I was not going to bring this up.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.880]   Zach said, bring it up.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.980]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.320]   You're already creating mischaracterizations.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.780]   You said you want to bring it up.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.260]   I'm like, sure.
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.280]   I don't, I'm not going to veto it.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.840]   Go for it.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.160]   I said, well, we have to bring on my COVID.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.960]   Obviously I'm the second bestie to get COVID.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.280]   And I told you offline without the other two besties,
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.180]   I will just say I got it at a social function, period.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.740]   End of story.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.880]   You said it's okay to talk about.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.100]   It's not like I wanted to bring it up.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.800]   You want to bring it up and I'm allowing it because I,
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.740]   I'm fine with it.
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.360]   So go for it.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.120]   We all got something at Saks' event.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.980]   You got COVID.
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.160]   I got chlamydia.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.020]   It's all fine.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.620]   Oh, you guys went to the downstairs rooms?
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.460]   I went downstairs.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.920]   I skipped the basement level.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.340]   God damn it.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.280]   Chamath again.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.760]   You promised.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.420]   It was a great party.
[00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.520]   Let's hear Jason's accusation.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.940]   I've been hearing about it all week in the chat.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.180]   There's no accusation.
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.280]   It was a great party.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160]   No, you've been saying it was a GOP super spreader.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.920]   You took it with COVID.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.240]   Jason, you were angry.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.960]   You were angry.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.680]   And you were, yeah, you were really mad at Saks
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.840]   because you thought he actually gave you COVID
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.080]   even though Saks had people test.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.260]   Every single person tested on the way in.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.300]   Except you, J-Cal.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.260]   J-Cal, you walked around the velvet room.
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.680]   I have.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.840]   And you said, guess what?
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.540]   I'm a bestie.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.320]   I don't have to test.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.540]   And you walk right in that party.
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.580]   And guess what?
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880]   At the end of the day, there's nothing.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.920]   The one person that flouted the rules got it.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.080]   Karma's a bitch, J-Cal.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.340]   Nothing better personifies poetic justice as what took place.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.940]   I do not place blame on anybody for hosting.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.280]   You walk around.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.080]   You rant at Saks.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.100]   You make fun of him.
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.940]   You poke him.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.500]   You poke the bear.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.480]   Republican this.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.520]   Republican that.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.460]   It was a Republican super spreader.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.860]   It was a GOP super spreader.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.180]   And then you go to his party.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.420]   And you run around the velvet rope.
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.520]   And you don't get your test.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.240]   And you go in.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.540]   And you walk out with COVID.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.500]   Why should I have to test?
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.200]   That was amazing.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.680]   Why should I have to test?
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.460]   It was really amazing.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.280]   I don't wait on lines.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.940]   I'm a bestie.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.280]   I think he walked out with COVID
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.700]   because I think he walked in with COVID.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.340]   There you go.
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.460]   He was the only one not to test.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.320]   So who brought it in?
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.180]   I did test.
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.560]   My daughter and I came to your wonderful party.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.360]   It was amazing.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.020]   It was delightful.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.080]   We tested.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.600]   No, you didn't.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   When you got to the party.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.660]   I 100% tested.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.360]   Do not lie.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.680]   You told us you didn't.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.380]   You told us you didn't.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.220]   You were either lying then or you're lying now.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.240]   I 100% tested.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360]   You were lying then or you're lying now.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.740]   Which one is it?
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.860]   I was joking then.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.600]   I 100% tested with my daughter.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   No.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540]   You're telling the truth.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.220]   Both was on the line testing with me.
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.080]   I had the bracelet.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.640]   I tested.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.300]   100%.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.060]   When I asked you,
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.600]   when you got into the party and I said,
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.820]   how'd your COVID test go?
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.660]   You said, oh, I pulled my bestie card.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.500]   I walked around.
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.660]   I pulled my bestie card.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.220]   That's not true.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.720]   That's true.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.500]   That's what you said.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.760]   You guys are getting up on me and making up bullshit now.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.320]   No, you said that.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.980]   Okay.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.420]   I may have made a joke,
[00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.860]   but I 100% tested.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.320]   Hold on, guys.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   And then I find out the reason why Jade wasn't at the party.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.460]   She was home taking care of two sick kids.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.800]   No, she wasn't.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.820]   Yes, she was.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.240]   We had one kid.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.020]   So how do we know that it wasn't you?
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.700]   Okay.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.720]   We know because.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.540]   I know it was you, Fredo.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540]   I know it was you, Fredo.
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.320]   That she brought it to the party.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.080]   You broke my heart.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.900]   All right.
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.560]   Here's what happened.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.700]   I went to the party.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.220]   I did test.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.220]   There was a group of people that got there early,
[00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.640]   had tested at another event.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.580]   They told me this.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.580]   They tested before they got there.
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.200]   And they told me that they had accidentally brought it with them
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.100]   because they were the first to have a positive test result.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.540]   So in all likelihood, it was that group.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.560]   It doesn't matter who brought it because Omicron is going everywhere.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.460]   What is it?
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.860]   Omicron.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.060]   Omicron.
[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.560]   Omicron.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.060]   It's a character from Transformers.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060]   I don't understand that.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.480]   What do you mean they brought it with them?
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.500]   If they tested negative.
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.380]   They came from another location.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.180]   They tested.
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.500]   They claim they tested.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.600]   Then they were the first to come up that next day with a positive result.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.940]   It takes longer than 24 hours to incubate.
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.640]   You're right.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.720]   So that means they must have brought it with them.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.740]   They tested on Sunday and had it.
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.000]   They were at the party Saturday.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But you're saying they tested negative at the door.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.720]   They did not test at the door.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.220]   They told me.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.720]   They did not test at Santa's party?
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.840]   They told me they tested the day before.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   Or two days before.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.540]   No, everybody was tested at the door, including staff, including vendors.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.120]   There were people who were turned around because they tested positive.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.240]   There was a group of ****** who didn't test.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.740]   Oh, you're trying to blame it on ******?
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.620]   No, I specifically have tried to not say the person's name and you're trying to include them in this.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.380]   It's going to get bleeped out.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.140]   They were all negative at the time of the party.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.720]   You hosted a super spreader.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.380]   They didn't get it till like five days later.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.880]   So they were not the earliest to test.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.380]   No, they had it the next day.
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.500]   You tested positive.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.120]   You had symptoms before they did.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.840]   Remember the tickle in the throat?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.620]   Guys, remember when he said last week he had the flu?
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.720]   He had the tickle in the throat?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.220]   Anyway, thank you for giving me Omicron.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.620]   I am now fucking super.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.900]   According to all results, I am now Superman.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.280]   Have you tested negative now?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.100]   Not yet.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.640]   I did a test yesterday.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.720]   Nine days later, I'm still coming up positive.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.100]   I had two days of symptoms.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.220]   Not that any of you give a shit, you rat bastards.
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.940]   You just laugh about my COVID.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.040]   Nobody had no point in this conversation.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.480]   Did any of you say, how are you feeling?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.980]   Was there any chance of death?
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.220]   Was there any chance?
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.300]   I was triple vax.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.520]   I had done Moderna.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.800]   At any point, though, did you feel like, oh, shit, I may have to go to the hospital.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.900]   I may need to go on a ventilator.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.240]   No, no.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.780]   That's too bad.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.520]   I felt the tickle in my throat on Tuesday.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.540]   You wanted his symptoms.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.720]   He coughed three times.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.520]   He sneezed twice.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   He prematurely ejaculated once.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.580]   Those were his symptoms.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.560]   ♪ Queen of Kinwild ♪
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.860]   - This is gonna be our prediction show.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.680]   Last week, we did of course, our 2021 Bestie Awards.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.660]   How did everybody feel about last week's awards?
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.020]   I think it was great, I listened to the edit.
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.260]   - It's done quite well.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.520]   - Yeah, I was happy with it.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.360]   - It was a fun show.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.420]   I think we all got to kind of talk about stuff
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.540]   we wanted to talk about, and it was pretty dynamic.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.340]   I thought it was a good show.
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.180]   I liked it.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.180]   - It was like a greatest hits.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.180]   - So we're gonna do some predictions for next year.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.180]   - Are you gonna do a drum roll and a little scene as well?
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.080]   - Yes, okay, here we go.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.240]   Here's an opening.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.420]   - But it's gotta be like flying into the future,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.680]   like going through space.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.860]   - Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.700]   - Warp speed.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.540]   - Warp speed.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.000]   - Flying through the air.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.620]   Warp wormhole.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.660]   Other side of the universe.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.660]   Here we are in 2022.
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.500]   - Okay.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.260]   - Biggest political winner 2022.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.680]   What did Tucker Carlson's former writers
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.800]   tell you to say, "Sax?"
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.980]   - It never ends, Sax!
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.180]   - It never ends.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.880]   - It's never gonna end.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.220]   People were intrigued about what was the second battle about.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.780]   That was the big debate.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.620]   - Which battle?
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.460]   - Oh, who knows?
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.300]   I can't remember the battles.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.140]   There's two of those.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.620]   - About the beep, beep,
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.820]   which led to me writing the Google doc about beep, beep.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.660]   - Oh, I know what it was.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.620]   - Timoth and I deserve a Bestie Award for that.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.020]   - Who's your biggest political winner?
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.860]   - Okay.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.940]   - Let's stop with the inside baseball.
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.760]   - My biggest political winner for 2022,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.980]   I predict my man Ron DeSantis.
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.180]   This will be the big winner.
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.560]   He's up for reelection in Florida.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.060]   He won in 2018 with less than 1% of the vote.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.180]   It was a real nail biter.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.540]   This time, I think he's gonna cruise
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.980]   to reelection quite handily
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.320]   and become the national front runner on the GOP side.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.080]   And the reason is because he had the right approach on COVID.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.320]   He made the vaccine available.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.300]   He made the antibodies available,
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.520]   but ultimately he treated the population like adults.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   He let them make their own decisions.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.780]   He kept businesses open, schools open.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.340]   And I think the rest of the country is gonna come around
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.760]   to his point of view
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.280]   because of the unstoppability of Omicron next year.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.100]   And so I think that DeSantis,
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.440]   who was much maligned and disparaged,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.020]   will come out as the big winner a year from now.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.140]   - All right, who do you got, Freeberg?
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.360]   - Vladimir Putin.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.280]   I think Putin's gonna benefit from the rising conflict
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.440]   between the US and China.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.580]   The other day, there was a call between Putin
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.520]   and Xi and they said,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.700]   and Putin called Xi his dear friend
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.680]   and said that relations between the two countries
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.460]   had reached an unprecedentedly high level.
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.880]   And I think that his position economically
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.560]   as a trade partner with China
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.680]   and as a beneficiary of Chinese economic prosperity
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.520]   will only grow as tensions between the US and China rise.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.260]   I think we're seeing that with some of his cavalier behavior
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.680]   with the Ukraine right now.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.860]   And I think Putin will become a stronger player
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.880]   on the global stage,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.300]   particularly as it relates to his relationship with NATO
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.700]   over the next year.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.940]   And he's been a little bit quiet the last few years.
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.920]   He was kind of, I'd say suppressed with sanctions
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.660]   and all the other nonsense that's gone on
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.540]   to keep him at bay,
[00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.220]   but he could kind of rise up again in 2022
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.080]   and he could become a real player
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.440]   on the geopolitical stage globally
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.620]   in a more meaningful way than he has
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.460]   in the last couple of years.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.480]   - I mean, you white guys love Putin.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.380]   - It's crazy.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.360]   The whites love Putin.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.200]   - I don't love him.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.040]   - God, I hate Putin.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.360]   - I mean, if you ranked Russia GDP,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.640]   do you know even, do you have any idea
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.480]   where it even ranks in a global scale?
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.860]   - Russia GDP is probably-
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.740]   - I mean, do you guys,
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.360]   for the amount of time you guys give Putin-
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.200]   - It's in the 30s.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.040]   - Probably eight.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.880]   - Probably eight?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.720]   - No, no, I think it's in the 20s or 30s.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   - Nigeria is like crushes Russia.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.980]   Nobody ever talks about Nigeria
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.100]   has all the same inputs except they're black.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.220]   - Yeah, they just don't have 2000 nuclear weapons.
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.060]   - I mean, as if those were-
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.900]   - That is the big reason.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.360]   I mean, it's a fallen empire for sure,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.140]   but they still have 2000 nukes.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.980]   - They don't work.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.180]   - Landmine, the position,
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.700]   the energy that it provides to Europe, Eastern Europe.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.480]   I mean, Russia is geopolitically pretty significant.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.720]   - Insignificant economically,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.640]   significant because they have a madman running the country.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.620]   - I don't think he's a madman,
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.280]   but I'm just saying that, you know,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.340]   there's a lot of ink that spilled about Russia
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.240]   and I don't think anybody even takes a step back
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.080]   and actually looks at-
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.140]   - All right, who do you got for yours?
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:44.980]   It's not Putin, obviously.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.240]   - Actually rank in the world, guys.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.280]   My worldwide
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.660]   biggest political winner for 2022 is Xi Jinping.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.380]   I think this guy is,
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.080]   he's firing on all cylinders
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.900]   and he is basically ascendant.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.580]   So 2022 marks the first year
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.280]   where he's essentially really ruler for life.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.860]   And so I don't think we really know what he's capable of
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.700]   and what he's gonna do.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.040]   And so that's just gonna play out.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.160]   - You think he's the biggest political winner, really?
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.960]   - Oh my God, I think it's going to be a,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.420]   he's gonna run rough shot,
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.420]   not just domestically, but also internationally,
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.880]   because you have to remember,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.960]   he controls so much of the critical supply chain
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.060]   that the Western world needs to be,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.940]   needs to survive, let alone-
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.980]   - I think you're completely wrong.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.260]   I think he's losing his power.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.200]   He's scared.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.300]   That's why he took out all these CEOs.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.080]   He's consolidating power because he fears
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.060]   that they're gonna win too big and then displace him.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.840]   And he has massive real estate problems over there
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.260]   that could blow up at any moment in time.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.400]   He could face a civil war there.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.760]   I think he's totally isolated himself.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.600]   - Civil war?
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.420]   They don't even have guns.
[00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.700]   - Every major country is removing their factories
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.540]   and removing this dependency.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.380]   - They don't even have any guns there.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.220]   What are you talking about?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.200]   What are they gonna riot with?
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.060]   - Did you not see Tiananmen Square?
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.880]   Did you not see the riots in Hong Kong?
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.220]   Are you not paying attention, Chamath?
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.860]   There's been many riots in China.
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.700]   They just happened to kill all the people.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.560]   - Jason, those were crushed.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.400]   And that's before he had full control.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.240]   - I'm not saying they will be crushed,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.540]   but he still will have massive amounts of,
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.220]   I believe, protests and yeah, he'll have to kill people.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.560]   - I think the bigger risk is that
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.640]   China gets better for Xi Jinping,
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.580]   but worse for everybody else in China.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's already worse for all the billionaires over there.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.100]   It's worse for the tech industry.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.480]   You've now got Evergrande,
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.920]   that whole gigantic debt implosion.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.000]   I think there could be contagion from China next year.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.340]   I don't think Xi's gonna lose his grip in any way,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.500]   but I'm not sure China's gonna have a good year next year.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.740]   - It's gonna be terrible.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.760]   I went with Ron DeSantis with USACS.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.360]   I think he's obviously a much more,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   he's a much more palatable candidate than Trump.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.820]   And I think Trump is not gonna wanna run.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.480]   And that brings me to my biggest political loser for 2022.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.720]   As we segue,
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.920]   I believe this is gonna be split between Biden and Trump,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.580]   the two most important people of the last four years.
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.840]   And I think Biden is gonna lose the midterms.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.320]   And I think Trump is gonna get destroyed
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.280]   with this January 6th thing and bow out and not run again.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.680]   Who do you got for your biggest loser?
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.160]   - Let me add,
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.800]   I'm kinda an octogenarian to that,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.220]   which is my pick for biggest political loser next year
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.720]   is Nancy Pelosi.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.300]   There's a red wave coming.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.340]   The Democrats for sure are gonna lose the house.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.860]   That is baked into the cake.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.820]   And I predict she will announce her retirement
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.820]   shortly after that.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.180]   She has served a couple of pretty consequential terms
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.020]   as speaker.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.100]   She's never lost a vote,
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.700]   but with this whole build back better,
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.300]   she forced all of her moderates to take a vote
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.740]   on 5 trillion in new spending,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.580]   which they then lost in the Senate.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:48.960]   And that's gonna cost them some seats.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.060]   So she contributed to,
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.160]   I think her own downfall,
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.660]   what's gonna happen next year.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.660]   - Is Nancy gonna come work at social capital
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.500]   and you're gonna give her a bucket of capital
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.120]   to work with to try to play the market?
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.820]   - By the way, Jason,
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.660]   who's the excellent writer you got from Tucker
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.620]   because I wanna hire them.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.160]   - All right, listen,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   I got somebody from the YouTube comments
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.220]   who said they would punch me up.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.120]   All right, I got Biden and Trump,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.760]   Nancy Pelosi, and then who do you got, Freeberg?
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   Who's your biggest political loser of 2022 prediction?
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.860]   - Mine's a little depressing,
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.000]   but I'm honestly a little bit worried
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.120]   about the United States influence
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.160]   on kind of a global stage,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.760]   socially, politically, economically.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.760]   And I think that there's a number of events
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.560]   that could catalyze kind of a precipitous series of events
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.960]   that could really harm the continuing influence
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.800]   the US has geopolitically.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.820]   So, I don't really have an individual,
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:48.560]   but I kind of have the US.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.500]   And it's in its role on the global geopolitical stage.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.620]   - US influence.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.500]   - US influence, yeah.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.060]   - And you said you thought there was gonna be
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.220]   this potential tipping point perhaps.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.660]   Did you see that being Taiwan or what?
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.500]   - I've got a couple of them.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.120]   I think when we get into our contrarian points of view,
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.420]   I'll share some of them.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.660]   - Okay.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.900]   Chamath, who do you got for your biggest political loser
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.820]   for 2022 prediction?
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.360]   - Well, look, I like your pick of Trump,
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.200]   which is not mine,
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.700]   but just to double down on this Trump thing,
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.360]   it's incredible to see that he's,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.760]   just a bamboozler.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.920]   You know, that's the same guy who's like,
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.100]   you know, telling people to not take the vaccine,
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.720]   gets boosted.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.700]   Then, you know, when he finally gets outed
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.220]   with this other scumbag, what's that guy's name?
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.520]   What's that other right knob?
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.600]   - Sax, take out your phone and go to speed dial.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.460]   Just read it.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.520]   - Riley, Bill O'Reilly, Bill O'Reilly.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.360]   Bill O'Reilly.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.600]   - Bill O'Reilly, yeah, that's number four on his speed dial.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.160]   - Those two dopes on stage are like,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.000]   yeah, I got boosted.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.820]   What about you?
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.660]   Yeah, I got triple vaxxed.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.820]   And then everybody's booing them.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.220]   I mean, they're just such.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.920]   - Watch what they do, not what they say.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.760]   - These guys are entertainers.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.120]   - If you're a dipshit on the alt-right.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.920]   - The great thing is they are phenomenal entertainers,
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.160]   but you can't trust a single word that they say.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.500]   So Jason, I think that that's a pretty good pick.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.020]   My pick is the progressive left as a class,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.460]   because I think these guys are being exposed
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.200]   basically for just being laughingstocks.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.960]   They're quickly becoming policy jokes
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   inside of Washington and in every city state that they run.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.040]   They just can't seem to put one foot in front of the other.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   And they've been run amok with folks
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.860]   like these teachers unions who have really, really,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.780]   really done a number on our children,
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.780]   which is now finally getting exposed in the mainstream media.
[00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.200]   And so all of these policies are just,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.120]   they're not rooted in any sort of science or legitimacy.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.760]   So they are, I think, going to pay a pretty heavy political
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.060]   price for mainstream voters in 22.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.580]   - You know what they remind me of those two guys,
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.880]   like the old guys from the Muppets, Statler and Waldorf.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.580]   That's what like those Trump and O'Reilly are.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.420]   Okay, biggest business-
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.140]   - I think Biden can still save a lot
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.440]   of his long-term reputation.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.580]   I think Trump's is-
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.960]   - What would Biden need to do in 2022?
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.800]   Number one thing-
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.180]   - He needs to disavow the progressives
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.760]   and basically shore up his party's ability
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.320]   to win back some seats and hold the line.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.560]   And so you're not gonna be able to end it.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.220]   You're gonna be able to enter some of these places
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.400]   with some of this rhetoric that he basically was convinced
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.340]   would be necessary for him to not lose the progressive left.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.520]   There just needs to be a conversation inside the White House
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.220]   where they actually go through the cold political calculus
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.380]   of my enemies, enemies, actually my friend kind of thing,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.960]   and actually go back to the center.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.800]   - Yeah, he needs to pull a Bill Clinton and triangulate.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.080]   - He needs to pull a Bill Clinton.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.920]   - Okay.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.420]   - And quickly too.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.800]   - I think it's way too early to conclude
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.260]   that the Biden presidency is over.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.360]   I mean, I think they're gonna lose Congress next year.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.660]   That's baked into the cake,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.640]   but he's still got two years after that
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.740]   to pull his chest down outside of the fire.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.340]   And if the Republicans overplay their hand
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.300]   and he tacks towards the center,
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.300]   you know, he can change his fortunes.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.540]   - He can change his fortunes quickly.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.660]   - He's down a pawn, but he could develop the board.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.500]   I got it.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.340]   - All right.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.880]   - I think the voice of populism's only gonna swell
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.140]   over the next year.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.700]   And that's gonna be the predominant force
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.300]   that's gonna drive both the alt-right
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.460]   and the progressive left.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.160]   And it, you know, you could make the case
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.000]   that, you know, politicians that are in seats
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.900]   should be kind of disavowing these,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.540]   what we today are calling kind of extreme voices,
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.340]   but they're only getting louder
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.640]   and the importance of kind of populist movements,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   not just in the US, but you look around the world.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.180]   I mean, look at what's happening in Brazil,
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.480]   various European countries.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.320]   I mean, it is-
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.360]   - Wait, so you think populism
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.900]   is gonna have a rebound in 2022?
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.160]   We're all saying that we think it's fizzling.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.480]   - Well, can I just say, Friedberg-
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.780]   - I think populism's swelling
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.920]   and I think it's gonna get louder.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.760]   - Oh, okay.
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.960]   - Low interest rates are gonna be
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.580]   higher rates are simply keeping things at bay for now.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.080]   And I think that's gonna shift very quickly in-
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.720]   - But Friedberg, populism just means what's popular.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.440]   And so I think there's a huge silent majority
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.900]   that's always stayed on the sidelines
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.440]   because they're not the ones that tend to have a tendency
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.720]   to complain, but when things get important enough,
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.820]   they typically show up.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.140]   And so, you know, we may find that actually
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.000]   centrism is what's most popular.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.200]   - I think populism is anti-elitism.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.480]   And I think that there is a growing concern globally
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.760]   because of globalization,
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.500]   that power and capital has been concentrated
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.300]   in the hands of a few,
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.640]   that the voice of the majority is we want to be shared.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.440]   We want that to all be shared equally.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.640]   And that's what's driving populism around the world.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.640]   And it's in the US, you know,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.200]   manifesting in different ways on the left and the right.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.080]   And you'll see this in other countries around the world,
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.440]   but I don't see the fundamental driving forces changing
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.900]   there until and unless we have massive taxation
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.560]   and redistribute wealth in a meaningful way,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.320]   and that's what's going to be the key to the future.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.800]   - Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.640]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.480]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.320]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.000]   I think that's a big part of it.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.820]   I think that's a big part of it.

[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.520]   that are not the traditional California and New York centers
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.240]   of industry and wealth.
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.580]   I think it's a trend that's been going on,
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.400]   but it's going to keep getting bigger next year.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:31.160]   If you guys saw the net migration numbers by state,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.740]   they're absolutely stunning.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.300]   Stunning.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.700]   So, and it's the zero-tax states
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.000]   that are just booming right now.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.520]   It's states like Florida and Texas and Tennessee
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.300]   and on and on it goes
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.740]   at the huge expense of California and New York.
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.260]   I think that trend's only going to pick up steam
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.620]   now that salt is dead.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.480]   I think there was a hope on the part of many people
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.840]   that Trump got rid of salt,
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.780]   but then the Democrats were supposed to bring it back
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.480]   and then AOC rejected it.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.820]   It's not coming back.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   And what that means is that if you're in, say, California,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.520]   for example, with the salt deduction,
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.560]   your effective tax rate was around 8%, not 13.3%.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.360]   Now it really is 13.3%.
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.280]   That's a huge increase.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.200]   And the politicians in California don't even realize
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.380]   that the tax rate has effectively gone up
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.960]   to the end taxpayer.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.480]   And the quality of life isn't any better.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.780]   We're not getting anything more for that.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.920]   And so I think this X is going to continue.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.820]   That's the subtle math that they actually really need
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:26.620]   to understand.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.160]   That 500 basis points, you can overcome that
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.820]   if your life is 5% better in enough ways
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.240]   where you're like, it's fine.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   And the reason why people are leaving is they feel
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.660]   that their life is actually much less than 5% worse.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.160]   Right.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.780]   If the trash doesn't get picked up.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.980]   The quality of life doesn't justify it.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.740]   You know, your windows are getting smashed in all the time.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.240]   Safety.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:46.540]   Your kids are, you know, dead.
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.120]   They're depressed and need counseling because of the way
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.200]   that the teachers unions lock them out of school.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.620]   You're just like, forget this.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.720]   I can't do this anymore.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:53.940]   Right.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.980]   You got to add those two numbers.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:55.940]   Here, here.
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.580]   That's what people really need to appreciate.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.700]   I don't think it's the actual effective tax rate,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.120]   but it's the delta of how poor your quality of life has gotten
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.580]   over these last few years relative to the tax you pay.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.880]   Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.000]   And then one other effect that I think plays
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.520]   into this is the reshoring of American industry,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.920]   which is not happening in places like California, New York.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.360]   It's happening in places like Texas.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:17.660]   Sure.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.380]   Samsung just announced a $17 billion investment
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.740]   in a new chip foundry in Texas.
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.860]   Here, I'll post this.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.440]   And there's a lot of things like this happening.
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.100]   So as we decouple from China and bring our supply chain home.
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.540]   Let's go.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.800]   That is going to be a big factor in the rise of the rest.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.040]   Love it.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:34.840]   Love it.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.320]   And it's great.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.840]   It's great for America because the wealth does need to be more evenly distributed.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.160]   It can't just go to tech and finance elites in California and New York.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.740]   All right.
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.880]   Um, I had two.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.840]   Uh, Disney was my biggest corporate winner for 2022.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.000]   Disney plus crushing it.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.420]   Parks raised prices.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.260]   People want to go to the park.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:59.200]   Spider-Man just had, I think the number two or number three all time, uh, opening in a pandemic,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.080]   which is crazy.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.020]   That IP is going to continue to work for them.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.800]   John Favreau and David Fiolini, I think is how you pronounce his last name.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.020]   Both crushing it with Mandalorian.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:15.860]   Boba Fett, one of the great characters from our childhood now is going to have his own book of Boba Fett starting on December 3rd.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.460]   29th.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.360]   Is that today or tomorrow?
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.620]   Uh, tomorrow.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.760]   And so I think Disney is going to have a huge surge.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.620]   I think they're undervalued, but my, my number one for this category of biggest business winner for 2022 was millennials in Gen Z.
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.200]   I think that they became completely empowered and independent.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:35.780]   They shook off the participation trophies and their entitlement during COVID.
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.080]   They realized that they have skills that are valuable.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.340]   They're sought after.
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.540]   They learned how to make money.
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.020]   They traded crypto.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.420]   They did stock trading.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.640]   They're doing shorts, puts, whatever.
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:46.480]   On Robin hood.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.400]   And they're just not impressed with people in power.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.980]   And they increasingly want to build shit and make money.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:56.140]   I think that those two generations have woken up and I think they're going to be the biggest winners in 2022.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:03.140]   Because dovetailing with your SMBs Chamath, I do think, uh, and I'm seeing it across my entire portfolio of companies.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.400]   Uh, you try to hire somebody and they're like, yeah, but maybe I can just start my own company.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   You and me and Saks are actually saying a flavor of the same thing, actually.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:09.900]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.140]   Because all these SMBs aren't going to happen in New York and San Francisco.
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.520]   They're happening all over the world.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.960]   America and there are people that are taking empowerment into
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.900]   their own hands. There's tooling for them. And there's
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.000]   opportunity, economic opportunity for them to build
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.820]   businesses on their own. And basically just say, you know,
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.780]   f nothing will build your confidence with you sacks.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.360]   Nothing builds your confidence like moving from one city to
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   another. And having that's a very empowering thing to do when
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.700]   you're just like, you know what, I'm going to just leave and go
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.340]   somewhere else. I'll make it myself. So I feel like they are
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.820]   super impressive to me
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.640]   really believe in I really believe in this because the
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.840]   three of us got there in totally different ways. But I
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.120]   think it's roughly all the same, we might be triangulating
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.780]   around a trend here biggest business loser for 2022. I'll
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.360]   just give it real quick. I think crypto projects that actually
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:26:00.140]   don't deliver a product in 2022 are just going to be lost. I
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.700]   think this idea that people are going to bet on things that
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.720]   don't exist in the real world or don't actually have
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   applications is going to end it's time for crypto to put up
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.040]   or shut up. And I think the crypto projects that do that,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.220]   which a number of them are starting to are going to store
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.840]   but it's going to be a big shake out there.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.420]   What do you got for biggest business loser in 2022?
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:17.920]   Freeberg?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.040]   I agree with you, actually, that was mine. Yeah, oh, wow. I
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.100]   said crypto bubble will burst. There's a lot of scammy nonsense
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.560]   going on. 90% of these projects, okay, you know, are not going to
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.340]   yield value and fundamentals. And I also think that rising
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.640]   interest rates are going to affect the crypto market.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.140]   There's a lot of leverage trades into the crypto assets, those
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.800]   will start to deliver as these interest rates shift up. And as a
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.380]   whole, you'll see a large percentage of them go away or
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.960]   decline in value, but a small number will continue to grow in
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   value, just like we saw in the dot com bubble blew up. There was
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.380]   a number of companies that survived. Most of them did not.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.100]   And the few that did survive ended up being coming worth 10
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.300]   times what the current market value is. And I think that that's
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.220]   still possible with these crypto projects. But I'd say 90% of them
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.800]   are probably going to start to blow up next year.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   What do you got, Shabbat?
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.960]   Well, I guess I'm fading you guys. And I'm also fading
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.560]   implicitly, Freeberg's pick of stripe. But I'm going to say,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.640]   you know, I think that the biggest business loser for 2022
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.180]   is Visa and MasterCard and traditional payment rails and
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.480]   the entire ecosystem around it. So I think that this is the year
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.760]   you can put on what probably will be the most profitable
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.020]   spread trade of my lifetime, which is to be short these
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:36.760]   companies, and that anybody that basically lives off of this two
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:43.220]   or 3% tax and be long, well thought out web three crypto
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.140]   projects that are
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.440]   rebuilding payments infrastructure in a completely
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.860]   decentralized way. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.220]   what you say won't also happen, both that stripe will have an
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.920]   incredible IPO and that a lot of these scammy crypto projects
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.020]   will go to zero. However, if you read the white papers of these
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.280]   crypto projects, and you systematically put together a
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.880]   framework, I think you can be long those. And you can be short
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.560]   Visa MasterCard because I think this is their peak market cap.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.760]   And for those of you don't know, fading and sports betting taking
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.140]   the opposite.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.440]   Side of a bet, taking the opposite team, I guess man visas
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.520]   market cap is half a trillion dollars, huh? It's incredible.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.640]   It's a completely contrived duopoly that doesn't mean to a
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.120]   young person and MasterCard is almost 400 billion. So they're
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.560]   trillion dollar combined market.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.040]   You have to understand that the canary in the coal mine here is
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.340]   pretty significant. The most important thing is Amazon.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.760]   Earlier this year, Nick, maybe you can post this decided to
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.420]   just shut visa off in the UK. Oh, yeah. Amazon is not going to
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:43.960]   do something like that.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.380]   In my opinion, unless it's a test of what they can do all
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.800]   around the world. And again, going back to this idea of arming
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.000]   the rebels, there really is no need today for all of these
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   small businesses to sit on top of visa, MasterCard and Amex
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.100]   rails, it's unnecessary. And so it'll probably get developed in
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.260]   the developing world first. This is why I think you know,
[00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.320]   focusing in markets like Nigeria, to me are way more
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.860]   exciting than talking about, right, you know, these fading
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.840]   Western European countries who are going to be the ones who are
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.860]   going to be the ones who are going to be the ones who are
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.460]   going to be the ones who are going to be the ones who are
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:15.980]   going to be the ones who are going to be the ones who are going to be the ones who are going to be the
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.120]   right. This is where this stuff will happen. It's not to say that
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.400]   those are those other companies can't, you know, trundle along
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.660]   for a while. But when I say, you know, we'll look back in 10
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.720]   years, and their market caps will be materially lower.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:34.200]   Anybody in those traditional infrastructure and rails versus
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.800]   anybody in this new infrastructure and rails will be
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.860]   it will look like a no brainer.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.580]   Do you consider the buy now pay later companies like a firm and
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.720]   upstart or whatever?
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   I don't know if upstart fits in that category. But some of these
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.320]   buy now pay later businesses as being the alternative to the
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.640]   traditional payment networks? Or do you think it's a different
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.160]   business?
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.160]   No, I've right now I think what what buy now pay later is, is a
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.500]   rate arbitrage, right? When as you said earlier, rates are
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.320]   very, very low. So the cost of capital is low. But it again,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.680]   starts to habituate the consumer experience to, I don't need to
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.440]   pay these users rates to these three credit card companies to
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.680]   facilitate a transaction of money that I already have or
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   money that I'm good for.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.100]   That's the big idea, right. And so when you translate that into
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.760]   Web three in a good project or a good series of projects, you're
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.940]   not going to need these companies. And so it's going to
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.920]   I think, eviscerate trillions of dollars of market cap.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.580]   Not to mention, you also have in between these two Venmo and
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.000]   cash app, which are not crypto, but they certainly as brands
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.700]   mean more to young people, like do you think Visa and MasterCard?
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.800]   Yeah, do you think block used to be called square is a good pair
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.740]   trade against Visa MasterCard in this context? Yeah, like it.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.660]   You know, I think that that
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.760]   starts to get closer to to the truth. My perspective is, you can
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.300]   kind of short anybody who's public, because anybody who's
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.100]   public can really only be public or will go public, because they
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.060]   feast off of this artificial two or 3% transaction fee.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.840]   Everybody does. The companies you want to be long are those
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   private companies in crypto that you can read the white papers of
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.520]   whose protocols have utility and who's building some element of
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.420]   infrastructure.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.920]   That replaces a traditional business. So as long as you can
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:21.100]   kind of build those things up, Balaji, for example, had a bunch
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.100]   of tweets this weekend where he was like, you know, I he has this
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.340]   idea for a mirror table. What is that that replaces, you know,
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.180]   cap table management, right now? Why is that important? Well, it
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.100]   because it touches all of these really important KYC AML
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.980]   investing laws across all these countries in all of these
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.760]   places. It's just a very simple example of where the new company
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   that actually builds that capability of these mirror tables
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.780]   will do so at virtually no cost. And so it'll have a 50 person
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.180]   team. And so they're not going to have offices all over the
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.680]   world, their cost basis will be, you know, an order or two orders
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.160]   of magnitude.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:01.720]   That's basic visa MasterCard became a tax. It took decades to
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.020]   have that power over folks. And then they but I think a firm does
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.720]   break that a firm breaks it because the people who are
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.420]   selling, then decide, you know what, we'll give a little bit of
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.580]   a discount here to get more people to buy.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.060]   Go ahead. They were the classic network monopoly network effect
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.520]   monopoly business, right? Like they got the small businesses,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.760]   they got the credit cards, and by extension, the consumers on
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.280]   the network. And ultimately, they created these these
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.880]   absolutely locked in networks. But as with all networks,
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.720]   complacency kind of, you know, drives innovation. And this
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.120]   field innovation that we're seeing is now starting to figure
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:37.000]   out ways to not just crack their way into the network, but to
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.500]   replace them with an entirely different model.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.200]   Last point on this, this is not one where I think this disruption
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.920]   has happened.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.400]   Disruption happens slow. I think it happens swiftly,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.820]   swiftly being five to 10 years. No, like in a year.
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.520]   Yeah, to my point is really interesting, because there's,
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.000]   you know, there are several billion people globally, who do
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.420]   not have credit and who are unbanked. And so if you think
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.040]   about where this is more likely to come from, it's more likely
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.540]   to come from an innovative model in those markets that then
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.260]   ultimately finds its way into the developed world. Versus, you
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.900]   know, trying to break apart visa and MasterCard and go get these
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.740]   small businesses to switch.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.040]   Switch out of them and so on today. So it's a really
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.420]   interesting.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.740]   Okay, sacks. What do you got?
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.300]   I don't know if it's biggest loser. But the thing I'm most
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.560]   worried about is in 2022, the Fed is going to stop quantitative
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.380]   easing or so they have said they are, I guess March will be the
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:31.120]   last month in which they do this QE. So starting in April, there
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.360]   won't be any of this liquidity pumped into the system. And so I
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.780]   think the the losers are going to be any of these asset classes
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.080]   that are heavily dependent on or have benefited from all this
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.340]   excess liquidity sloshing through the system. It's true
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.900]   that the stock market I think has already priced in rate
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.980]   increases and an increase in the discount rate. But I don't know
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.060]   if markets can fully price in reduction in liquidity. We don't
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.940]   know exactly what that's going to look like. And so if liquidity
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.200]   is reduced next year, I think that could reverberate through a
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.920]   bunch of markets including you know, everything from sports
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.460]   cards, you know, collectibles, which have gone through the roof
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.840]   to art
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   to crypto to, you know, maybe some growth stocks and on and on
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.340]   it goes. So that's my biggest worry is what happens when the
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.720]   Fed stops QE.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.640]   The biggest loser is markets because of quantitative markets
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:30.400]   that have to get off drugs, basically.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.580]   Okay, most contrarian belief. Sax, why don't you tell us your
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.700]   most contrarian belief since I'm sure that you workshop this with
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:40.540]   the contrarian Peter Thiel himself. It never ends.
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.780]   Yeah, I mean, so I have a couple of them here. Actually,
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.420]   you want to wait and go after everybody else? Sure. Yeah, go
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:46.540]   ahead.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.940]   I don't even know if this is contrarian or just
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:55.780]   unconventional. But I think that all of this pressure in on the
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:02.800]   progressive left will manifest in the chosen one, AOC deciding
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.200]   to step up and run against Schumer in the primary in June of
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.580]   2022. And she will lose.
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.340]   Wow, that's a good prediction.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.660]   I like to mouth prediction.
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:15.940]   That's a bold one. Yeah, that she would lose his ball.
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.920]   Well, sorry, just to give a little bit of color in this, like,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.660]   let's just assume that she doesn't. Right. And you know,
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.360]   she shouldn't but let's think about where she's sitting. Build
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.100]   back better is over. There's an enormous amount of stuff
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.220]   happening right now where, you know, it looks like the
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.680]   progressive left is really going to be put under pressure. And
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.620]   it's almost as if she's really going to be the standard bearer.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.400]   And
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.020]   she needs to do something quickly. Otherwise, she's going
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.340]   to have to wait until she's 38. You know, she's, you know,
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.480]   another six years from now, because it's not unlikely that
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.260]   she's going to run against Kristen, Kirsten Gillibrand. So
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.860]   this is kind of like it may be a moment where out of her sheer
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.640]   frustration, she steps up. And then we will see whether
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.180]   freeburgers right or I'm right, whether the populism is really
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.560]   around the left or the populism is really around the silent
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:03.960]   majority.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.380]   What do you got? Sex?
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.120]   I think it's good. I think that's a very good prediction.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.560]   In a similar way, I predict that there will be a strange new
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.920]   respect for Bill Clinton in the Democratic Party by the end of
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.780]   next year. Why? Because after the red wave, there'll be a
[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.300]   recognition that they need to move towards the center, they
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.620]   need to triangulate. And, and Clinton was the one who provided
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.420]   the formula for doing this, he dragged the Democratic Party
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.500]   back to the center after they were losing elections. And the
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.660]   other piece of this is going to be that
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.940]   it's already the case in polling that Hispanics and Asian Americans
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.180]   now are swing voters. And I think you're going to see in
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.720]   November 2022, that they go for Republicans and big numbers. And
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.060]   so the idea that the Democratic Party can just coast to election
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:53.000]   based on demographics, I think that theory is going to be
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.780]   imperiled. Yeah. And so they're going to be looking to Clinton
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.440]   and maybe not so much Obama, as the as sort of the predicate they
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.200]   should be, you know, aspiring to in the future.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.020]   I think what's important about that is those groups of people,
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.880]   I think are offended by the
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.860]   the free money gets something for nothing. They're hardworking
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.880]   immigrant people who have pride, they don't want handouts. And
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.980]   then you have this left white liberal maniac saying, No, no,
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.220]   you're poor, you need handouts, you don't, you shouldn't work,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.700]   you need handouts, you're, you know, and I just think they
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.340]   don't buy it. And that's why I think they're gonna go to the
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.540]   Republicans, because Republicans are hardworking and freedom
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.040]   loving.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.620]   And what was Clinton's big tagline in his campaign, he said
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:34.640]   that he supports people who work hard and play by the rules. That
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.160]   was that so great. That's the message that Democrats got to
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.880]   refine, right?
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.540]   Now, they seem to be on the side of basically, drug addicts. I
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.480]   mean, you know, people who junkies are contributing nothing
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.600]   and pitching tents in the middle of public spaces and, you know,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.340]   participating in open air drug markets. Yeah, what do you got
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.100]   and sore losers? Don't forget sore losers. Yeah.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.600]   And hysterical free burn and hysterical people. I mean, big
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.980]   hysterical just never good. Look,
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.080]   if you'll bear with me, I have, I have three, but I couldn't
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.640]   really pick. So the first one is I think, and I shared this on
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.880]   the pod the other day, I think we'll see the start of the
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:15.200]   next episode of great global conflict. We often rationalize
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.100]   the series of events that that catalyze conflict after the fact,
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.600]   rather than recognizing that there was emotional conditioning
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.900]   that allowed it to arise in the first place. I think we're in a
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.320]   state today, where the conditioning is such that we're
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.640]   more inclined to engage in conflict globally than we have
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.680]   been in a very long time. I don't know if it's kind of the
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.640]   conflict meter, or what happened.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   Yeah, I think it's kind of the conflict meter, or what happened
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   in the first place. I think we're in a state today, where the
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:37.740]   conditioning is such that we're more inclined to engage in conflict
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:37.840]   globally than we have been in a very long time. I don't know if it's
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   kind of the conflict meter, or what happened in the first place.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   I think we're in a state today, where the conditioning is such that we're
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:37.940]   more inclined to engage in conflict globally than we have
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.840]   you. But you know, you could see proxy wars, and proxy
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.480]   conflict that arise sort of like what we're seeing, you know,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.080]   maybe something in the Ukraine, maybe something related to
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.160]   Taiwan. But this is primarily predicated by the fact that
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.100]   we've got kind of this inflationary environment and the
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:59.620]   rise of populism will force the kind of domestic policymakers
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.200]   and legislators to say we should do something that's active and
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.480]   something that will allow us to unite our nations to go and get
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:07.780]   into a conflict.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.280]   conflict somewhere, or more likely to do that than not. And so
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.660]   I would say that the conditioning is there to see something like
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.800]   that happen. And so we're not kind of thinking, hey, next year
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.960]   is going to be a year of war. And that's why it's contrarian. I
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.040]   think that there may be war that we're not kind of paying
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.660]   attention to today, or that will surprise us after the fact. The
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.600]   second thing is, I'd say China may solidify its position next
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.040]   year. And this is going to sound a little crazy as a leader in
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.640]   climate change mitigation. Whereas it's
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.680]   historically been considered kind of the primary foe against
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.240]   climate change. And there's a couple of behaviors we've seen
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.820]   come out of China recently that I think number one, remember,
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.180]   China is a very rational actor, they do analysis, they make
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.140]   decisions based on long term investments and thinking, they
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.840]   recently announced that they're going to build 115 new nuclear
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.020]   reactors over the next 15 years at a cost of roughly $450
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:04.420]   billion. That's about $3 billion per nuclear power plant. The US
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.440]   is currently spending $30 billion building two power plants in
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:07.580]   Georgia. And that's a huge amount of money. And that's a
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:08.080]   huge amount of money. And that's a huge amount of money. And that's
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.580]   a huge amount of money. And that's a huge amount of money. And
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:08.580]   that's a huge amount of money. And that's a huge amount of money.
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.080]   So the Chinese have figured it out. They've also publicly
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.820]   declared that they're going to be completely carbon neutral with
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.580]   their economy by the year 2060. And they're making the
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.500]   investments through these nuclear power plants to
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.780]   demonstrate that they're actually on the road to do that.
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.340]   And there are a number of other infrastructure initiatives that
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:27.960]   are meant to help them achieve significant reductions in in
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.500]   carbon by by 2040. So So let me just point out why this is
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.420]   important, because right now everyone thinks China is the
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.780]   foe, they're causing climate change, they're the biggest
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:35.800]   problem. Imagine if over the next decade, China is the biggest
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:35.940]   problem. Imagine if over the next decade, China is the biggest
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.740]   problem. Imagine if over the next decade, China is the biggest
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.640]   year, some of what they're doing pays off. And everyone
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.860]   says, My gosh, China is leading the world in climate change
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.060]   mitigation, their influence socially and politically will
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.820]   rise. And this this gives China a very strong kind of position,
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.940]   you know, on a global stage and with kind of people around the
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.700]   world thinking, instead of China being a foe, maybe they're the
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.480]   leader and the US is the laggard. And that creates a my
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.260]   third is very random, which is some sort of natural catastrophe.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.860]   We
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.740]   we
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:05.920]   never
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.280]   account, you know, all natural catastrophes are very low
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.700]   probability, but very high severity. If you multiply the
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.460]   probability by the severity, you have what's called the expected
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.720]   loss, we always undervalue the expected loss of massive
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.600]   catastrophes, natural catastrophes. We haven't had one
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.040]   in a while. It's a very low probability bet for me to say,
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.300]   Hey, maybe we will. But if we do, it's certainly under
[00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.140]   appreciated in markets today. And so when these kind of, you
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.660]   know, black swan type events occur, did you? Did you watch
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.600]   Don't Look Up on Netflix? Is that why you're no, what is that?
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.940]   It's a new movie about a crap. Don't watch it. It's polarizing.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.240]   Let's leave it out for now. Okay. I'll watch it. It's crap.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.360]   My most contrarian belief is I think this is contrarian is that
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.540]   American influence and exceptional exceptionalism is
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.460]   going to soar.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.180]   That is contrarian.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.580]   I think we've empowered this next generation as I talked
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:05.360]   about earlier, millennials, Gen Z are ready to be independent to
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.880]   build shit. And I think Gen X is going to start taking over from
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.600]   boomers, as is what's happening in this very podcast here as we
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.240]   start to hit our prime years as executives. And then all these
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.640]   boomers are retiring, as Chamath has pointed out over and over
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.720]   again, and they're going to pass down their wealth, which then
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.480]   creates a perfect storm of a ton of capital, a ton of energy,
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.640]   lots of new ideas, a different perspective, what our economy is
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.740]   going to boom. And we will prove once again, that we're the
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.740]   greatest country and economy in the world.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.020]   Dickie, you're not you're not a contrarian. You're what we call
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.200]   an optimist. Yeah. Okay. And then I'll add to that, Jake, how
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.400]   what are we? Are we Gen X?
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.660]   We're Gen X. Yes. And the fighting over COVID abortion
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.080]   guns, social justice and all this stuff is so exhausting. Not
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.060]   that these are not important issues that I think everybody is
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.640]   going to move to, let's just start respecting and building and
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.440]   solving problems. And I just think American exceptionalism
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.520]   will be
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.100]   all that happens in 2022.
[00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.580]   I just think that that is my contrarian belief for 2020.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.980]   Everybody believes it's all primary.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.580]   race. Everybody believes it's coming apart. I don't think
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.320]   that it's coming apart. century in a year. I think it's gonna be
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.020]   a great year. I think it's gonna be a great year. I give my second
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:20.040]   contrarian prediction. Oh, God, here we go. Yes. Okay. Good. Here
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:23.280]   it is. I think the media, the media is going to pull a total
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.180]   180 on COVID. Okay, so after pumping out COVID fear porn for
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.240]   two years, you're going to change their tune next year.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.880]   Some of the things you're going to hear we need to live with
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.680]   COVID. It can't be eradicated.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.400]   They're even going to say it's it's more like a cold or flu.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.280]   They're going to say that politicians can't be expected to
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.560]   stop it. They're going to memory hole their support for lockdowns
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.920]   or we never supported that. And why is all this because we have
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.940]   an election next year and more Americans have already died from
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.760]   COVID under Joe Biden than Donald Trump. That's a pretty
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.080]   amazing hold. What was your term? Yeah, you've never heard
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.660]   the term memory hole. It's what the memory hole got it. Yeah.
[00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:04.640]   But did you guys know that?
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.520]   That more Americans have already died from COVID under Joe Biden
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.400]   than Trump? That's that is stunning. Yeah, it is stunning.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.760]   Are you sure? Yeah. 100% now,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.480]   it's writers triple fact checked it. Yeah, they did. They did.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.680]   No, look, look it up. And it's certainly it's gonna be even
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.060]   more true.
[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.820]   It's on info worse.com. You can look it up.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:22.700]   Omicron wave.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.360]   Now look, I don't blame Joe Biden for that.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.000]   Sorry, why is that because Trump had no vaccine and Biden has had
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.100]   vaccines and everything else.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.620]   Maybe it's the consistency of the consistent, you know,
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.980]   one to 2000 people die a day 1400 a day. So maybe it's just
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.040]   that consistency in the US. Yeah, I think it's because of the
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.820]   Republican states that refuse to do any mitigation. Okay, let's
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.320]   keep going.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.520]   Look, I don't blame Biden for that. I don't blame any President
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.720]   United States. Nonetheless, Biden campaigned on the idea of
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.800]   these quote unquote, shutting down the virus. He and the
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.380]   Democrats claim to that they would be able to eradicate it.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.580]   That was the entire basis for all these COVID restrictions.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:07.940]   Now it's it's the case that it can't be done. Everyone's
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.740]   realizing that they're gonna have to move the goalposts and
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.960]   memory hole ever saying that. And so the Democrats desperately
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.160]   need COVID to be over for the 2022 midterms. Therefore, the
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:20.480]   media will say it's over.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.760]   Well, you started to see it already, because the media is
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:25.200]   probably scratching their head. They were the ones trying to
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.180]   force these lockdowns, you know, basking in the glow of whatever
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.340]   press release the the Centers for Disease Control would put
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.540]   out. And all of a sudden, the CDC just had to go back to the
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.780]   COVID. They just had to do a complete 180. And when they used
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.740]   to force 10 day quarantines, for these positive tests and people
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.860]   with COVID, they just backtrack to five. And why? Well, it's
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.180]   because there's nobody to work.
[00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.780]   And a Delta CEO asked for it last week. And now they're I
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.940]   don't know if that's exactly true. But the CDC ultimately
[00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.100]   really is just in the hands of big business. And so when big
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.060]   business needs these workers to come back, you know, they probably
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.040]   pissed off a lot of unions who would have loved to have just
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.340]   had a positive test and stay home forever. The teachers
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.100]   unions, particularly, here we are.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.240]   This is a really tough situation.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.080]   Well, and look, and to be clear, the message that the media is
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.900]   going to deliver about COVID next year, it'll be the first
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.220]   time I agree with it. But it's completely dishonest to them to
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.920]   pretend like they were never in favor of lockdowns. And they
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.340]   completely inflated the threat and created this whole hysteria.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.860]   And next year, they're gonna have to back off. But also take
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:31.000]   into account sacks, that this new variant is much less deadly.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.460]   So it would be logical for people to take a less severe
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.000]   action on it.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.600]   Hold on, Jason. We don't know whether there are more variants
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.120]   to come in the future that could be much worse. But we also don't
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.780]   know what could be subsequently. So the point is, the CDC made a
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.500]   decision, broadly speaking, about everything. They're not
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.020]   making a decision about Omicron. They didn't say if you have
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.240]   Omicron, because not as if they really even test for it.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.860]   I'm just talking to sacks.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.980]   The reason they shortened this is because they didn't know what
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.780]   they were doing before. They don't fundamentally know what
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.420]   they're doing now. They're making best guesses. And the problem with these
[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.640]   best guesses is that they're inaccurate. And it forces
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.780]   enormous amounts of waves of havoc. Every time they make a
[00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.520]   decision, I'm talking about I'm talking about sacks, this
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.360]   prediction that the media will flip a logical person, including
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.600]   everybody on this call, because of Omicron taking over for Delta
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.240]   and being a natural blocker, it would be the logical thing to
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:25.540]   do. So in defense of the media, which I'm not apt to do, it's
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.700]   logical for everybody to take a different approach right now,
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.060]   because Omicron is 40 times more contagious, it blocks Delta, and
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.320]   it's become the dominant variant.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.300]   Jason Kuznicki: I think the right now the media is confused.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.780]   I'm not sure which way to go. So you know, there's a high
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.300]   probability that they tack towards what sacks is saying. But
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.180]   if you read the New York Times article, it was through gritted
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.180]   teeth. They presented the fact that the CDC changed the guy.
[00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.820]   Yes, if you read that article, it was like pulling teeth.
[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.480]   The media is the media. Can you just define that a little bit?
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.320]   It's everybody about Fox News. Come on. It's the elite prestige
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.220]   media. It's the New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.060]   on and on and on.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.520]   Do you think there's a bigger audience with the aggregate of
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.340]   those publications you just mentioned?
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.200]   Or the direct to the consumer publications that are happening
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.560]   on YouTube?
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.120]   Of course, they're being disaggregated because of their
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:12.780]   dishonesty.
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.580]   So does it matter?
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:15.800]   Yeah, of course, it still matters because they still have
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.220]   a lot of influence they do.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.820]   And no offense to everybody on YouTube. But we haven't gotten
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.780]   yet to the economic viability where enough people on YouTube
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.840]   can cover the broad spectrum of things that are important. And
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.360]   then the mechanisms and incentives to amplify it. So for
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:29.820]   example,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.680]   that's a good point.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.300]   We still need CNN, there was a woman on CNN, Nick, please post
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.560]   a clip that you could we posted in the group chat, talking about
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.660]   the incidence of suicide rates and depression in our children.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.020]   So what happened when they were locked out of school for two
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.920]   years, okay, and I am not going to stop talking about this.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.220]   Because this is the issue of our times. These are our kids.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.240]   Well, I want to get to underreported stories as well,
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.780]   Jan.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.580]   Oh, for me, I mean, I my kids hear me rant about this every
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.800]   day. So I may as well tell you guys it's the crushing impact
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.260]   that our COVID policies have had.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.160]   They've had on young kids and children, by far, you know, the
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.480]   least serious risk for serious illness. But I mean, even
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.000]   teenagers, you know, a healthy teenager has a one in a million
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.820]   chance of getting in dot and dying from COVID, which is way
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.540]   lower than, you know, dying in a car wreck on a road trip, but
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.760]   they have suffered and sacrifice the most especially kids and
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.500]   underrepresented at risk communities. And now we have the
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:34.200]   Surgeon General saying there's a mental health crisis among our
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.700]   kids, the risk of suicide girl suicide attempts among girls now
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:45.300]   up 51% this year, black kids, nearly twice as likely as white
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:49.440]   kids to die by suicide. I mean, school closures, lockdowns,
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.700]   cancellation of sports, you couldn't even go on a
[00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.100]   playground in the DC area, without cops scurrying, getting
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.820]   shooting the kids off tremendous negative impact on kids. And
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.540]   it's been an afterthought. You know, it's it's it's hurt their
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.080]   dreams.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.620]   They're future learning loss, risk of abuse, their mental
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.900]   health. And now with our knowledge, our vaccines, if our
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.080]   policies don't reflect a more measured and reasonable approach
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.840]   for our children, they will be paying for our generation's
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:23.760]   decisions, the rest of their lives. And that to me is the
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.860]   greatest underreported story of the past year.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.100]   And I don't see it being talked about anywhere we talked about
[00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.400]   at first, you know, I posted that link about the decrease in
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.960]   IQ points. Yep. And then
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.120]   we started to talk about it there slowly. And now it's
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.420]   trickling into the mainstream media where they're forced to
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.040]   talk about who's impacted. It's not rich kids. It's not middle
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.880]   class kids. It's all of our fantastic clip. That CNN clip
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.360]   was fantastic ones who are the ones who get hit the hardest.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.140]   They can't do supplemental. It's not just that. Don't don't
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.000]   minimize what this is. This is every child. Yes, it is
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.860]   proportionally affected. It is the data was that it's
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.320]   disproportionately affecting minority kids. Yes. And that
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.200]   could be because of the sociology of the parents. But
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:03.600]   Jason,
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.200]   you can also have rich parents. Okay, Jay. So just saying color
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.660]   parents. I'm saying all poor kids, white poor kids who are
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.420]   public school poor kids, they're getting hit the minority kids of
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.480]   all kinds. But frankly, the point is, it's all kids of all
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.960]   kinds. Okay, so we don't need to sub segment this to make this
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.940]   issue go away and seem smaller than it is. We have literally
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:25.640]   put 10s of millions of children. Yes, at risk because of our
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:26.880]   behavior. Yes.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   I'm agree with you. And I'm not trying to minimize it or make it
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.720]   a smaller issue. Your point is that none of the smaller audience
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:39.060]   is or smaller new media folks on YouTube or their podcasting have
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.760]   enough breadth to really make an impact by talking about this
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.220]   topic. Is that what you're saying that the mainstream media
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.220]   is needed to hit the broad base? No,
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.680]   what I'm saying is very specific. The people on YouTube
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.520]   cover what the people on YouTube want. Okay, the people on
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.020]   podcasts cover what they want. They're all very narrow,
[00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.140]   especially their narrow niche. Okay, yeah, there is no set of
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.340]   incentives that then threads that together. And then
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.600]   amplifies, right in the absence of those two
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.000]   mechanisms. Right. Those are software mechanics, and economic
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.680]   mechanics that need to get built in. What we lose is signal
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.520]   right that, in my opinion, right now over the last two weeks, is
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:17.780]   the single most important signal and it is nowhere except for
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.100]   this one clip on CNN, and the discussion that we had two weeks
[00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.000]   ago, because the YouTube I just want to be really clear on this
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.220]   because the YouTube is full of react videos, right? And so
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:32.520]   games, which is fine. And the consumer is talking about this
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.480]   issue and actually holding the conversation.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:37.020]   Right. But the question is, is this really the right thing to
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.620]   do? Is this really the right thing to do? And how do we get to
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.380]   that point? And how do we get to that point? And how do we get to
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.900]   that point? Because if we don't, then we're going to lose our
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.020]   lives. And if we don't, then we're going to lose our lives.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.160]   And we're going to lose our lives. So what do we do? We're
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:53.420]   going to lose our lives. And so we're going to lose our lives.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.360]   And so we're going to lose our lives. And the reason why we're
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.360]   going to lose our lives is because we're going to lose our
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.000]   lives. And we're going to lose our lives. And we're going to
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.360]   lose our lives. And so we're going to lose our lives. And we're
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   going to lose our lives. And we're going to lose our lives. And
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.320]   - I thought it was a CBS, it was a CBS whatever.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.420]   Was a Sunday show.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.740]   - But my point is these are the things that really matter
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.880]   and we haven't figured it out yet.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:11.720]   - What you're saying,
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.260]   and I think it's a really important point
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.260]   is that as a YouTuber, as a podcaster,
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:18.120]   you pick your niche that you can hit home on
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.480]   and you hit home over and over every week.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.940]   But no one says, I'm gonna broadly talk
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.540]   about the issues of our time and make sure.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:26.420]   - No, no, that's not true.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.260]   We do.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.700]   - We do, but it's a small subset,
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.280]   but I think the bigger picture here is that --
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.960]   - Listen, there's more than a million people a week
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.100]   that listen to this.
[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.740]   We've far exceeded MSNBC's average viewership.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.340]   We're probably gonna pass most CNBC shows
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.080]   and some CNN shows by the end of next year.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.500]   So we will do it, but there's not enough.
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   There needs to be more of us.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.300]   - We're an opinion show as much,
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.980]   we're not a traditional reporting show, right?
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.160]   In the sense that like go out,
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:54.740]   gather data and facts and present them,
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:55.580]   or do you disagree with that?
[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:56.420]   - Not that they do that anyway.
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.260]   - I disagree with that. - Okay.
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.100]   - I disagree.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.200]   I actually think we do a decent job
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.080]   of filtering for the truth.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.560]   And the reason we're able to do that is
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.400]   because of our friendship,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.180]   we can hold each other accountable
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.700]   and call out the bullshit when we see--
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.760]   - 'Cause we don't have incentives.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:08.960]   We don't have anything to lose, right?
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.720]   - I don't think there's an incentive here for us.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.740]   But I wanna build on something that Zach said.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:16.420]   See, it is very hard for the media to hold this dissonance
[00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:18.800]   because they're saying everybody needs to shelter in place.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.220]   COVID is this huge thing.
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:24.020]   They put the death count, they put the case counter up.
[00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.780]   They won't talk about deaths in ICU.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.700]   They won't talk about who's getting COVID
[00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.880]   because they have an incentive to get more ratings
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.160]   through COVID or Trump, and they took that
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.980]   and then it's a narrative violation
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.080]   or it's cognitive dissonance if they say at the same time,
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.300]   everybody needs to shelter in place.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.940]   This thing is really deadly,
[00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:41.440]   but we should send our kids to school.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.140]   So they couldn't take that position, Zach and Chamath.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.320]   They couldn't take the position that,
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.700]   oh, well, kids could go to school
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:47.980]   because that would go against,
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.900]   hey, everybody needs to shelter in place.
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:54.160]   And they picked, I think, COVID is this super deadly thing.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.520]   Everybody has to shelter in place over children.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.640]   - I think you're giving them way too much credit.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:02.000]   I think what happened was they had a position to react
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.440]   to aggregate lost power and they took it.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.280]   - That's real sinister.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:09.940]   - And they did not think about the true consequences.
[00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:11.220]   And it may not have happened
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.940]   at any one individual reporter level,
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.080]   but when it ladders up to the editorial board
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.680]   and the decisions of the people who run the mass heads
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.220]   of these organizations, they made the decision
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.280]   that currying and organizing power was more important
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.680]   than shining a light to do the right thing.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.880]   Specifically in this case,
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.840]   the thing that aggravates me the most is around our kids.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.020]   I think they were going for ratings,
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:35.040]   but anyway, we can keep debating it.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.360]   - Well, the one thing we can say for sure
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.080]   is they created a hysteria.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.240]   Whether their motivation was ratings
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.780]   or a power grab or political advantage,
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.240]   there's probably all the above,
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.820]   but the bottom line is they wanted to create a hysteria
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:50.560]   and they've been pumping COVID fear porn
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.280]   into the population for the last two years.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.820]   But my prediction, like I said,
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.020]   is that it all flips next year.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:56.860]   Why?
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.700]   'Cause there's an election
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.260]   and the way the media figures out
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.680]   what its narrative is gonna be is they start
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.620]   with the election result they want,
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:06.180]   and then they reverse engineer the narrative
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.720]   that they think's gonna help achieve that election result.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.080]   And if it means contradicting what they said yesterday,
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.260]   they will memory hole what they said yesterday
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.340]   in order to get on board with the new narrative.
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.280]   That is what's gonna happen.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.120]   - I do think you're right,
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.180]   but I think I just, I don't wanna lose this thread
[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.900]   because this has nothing to do with COVID,
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:26.660]   meaning COVID was a symptom of this.
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.400]   But if you really thought
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.520]   that the organized mainstream media
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.180]   had the right to be,
[00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:36.140]   has a purpose to be on the right side of justice,
[00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:40.220]   where were they when school boards were stripping out
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.600]   advanced placement programs for kids?
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.740]   Or where were they when they were shutting kids out?
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:46.740]   Or where were they when they were engaged in eight hour-
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:47.680]   - They can't go against the unions.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:52.120]   - Debates about whether a male can be on a committee
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.620]   because he's gay, but he's not black.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:58.620]   I mean, these were the issues that stopped our children
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.360]   from literally walking into the classroom every day.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.180]   And those stories were not told
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.740]   and they didn't happen just in one place,
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.840]   they happened all across the country.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.220]   And this is where those folks had a responsibility
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.500]   because they also probably had kids
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.940]   and they didn't do a thing about it.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.400]   That one issue for me really drives me crazy.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.640]   - Let me ask a probing question here.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:23.160]   We assume we're gonna get out of this pandemic in 2022,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.000]   knock on wood, no more variants.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.040]   What is the obligation and technique,
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.200]   the strategy to solve what we did to these kids?
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.040]   And I just wanna put it out there.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.080]   We don't have to answer it now,
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.880]   but I think we could spend an episode just talking about that.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.960]   - That's a very difficult question, J. Cal,
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:40.200]   that I think you need sociologists and psychologists
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.040]   and educators to help answer.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.960]   - We also need entrepreneurship and ideas
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.700]   and we need to have a dialogue so we can bring them on.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.820]   But if we're gonna spend all this money on build back better,
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.380]   how about we build back the 20 lost fucking IQ points
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.200]   that these kids have and then we do something
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.960]   about the depression and anxiety they have?
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.800]   - Hallelujah.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.000]   - Jason, we're never gonna get there
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.880]   because the teachers unions won't even acknowledge
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.960]   that learning loss exists.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.780]   The leaders-
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:01.040]   - Well, I think we need to break the teachers unions
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:01.880]   period full stop.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:04.740]   - Yes, oh, let me make a prediction in that regard next year.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.880]   There's gonna be a ballot initiative in California
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.820]   to the first school choice.
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:12.940]   And the way it's gonna work is that I think
[00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.520]   there's something like $13,000 spent per pupil in California.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.360]   - That's right.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.200]   - That's the right number.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.760]   - There's gonna be a ballot initiative that says
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.580]   that any parent who wants to send their kid
[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:26.000]   to an accredited school can get a voucher
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.700]   for $13,000 from the state.
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:28.840]   That's just gonna be on the ballot.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.520]   - Competition, let's go.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:30.880]   - I predict it.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.780]   I predict it will be the big, big election in California
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.420]   and maybe the nation next year.
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.760]   And I think more than a hundred million will be spent
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.260]   on both sides of that thing.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.660]   And I can't predict it's gonna win.
[00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:41.500]   I hope it does.
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.120]   - This is a topic worth fighting over.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.140]   This is something important to fight over.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.040]   - Yes. - Absolutely.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:46.860]   - It's school choice.
[00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:47.680]   'Cause you know what?
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.520]   - Absolutely.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.380]   - These guys pulled the wool over everybody's eyes.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.880]   They slipped them the Mickey, they hoodwinked them.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.920]   You need choice.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:56.200]   We know this as entrepreneurs.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.540]   If there is no competition, things do not get better.
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:00.720]   These school unions
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.420]   are complacent and they are not fighting.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.260]   - Let's make a resolution.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.100]   Let's make a new year's resolution
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.400]   'cause I think we all agree on this.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.760]   I got approached about this ballot initiative.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.600]   - Let's do it.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.700]   - It's gonna happen.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.040]   There's gonna be, like I said,
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.540]   a major ballot initiative next year
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.180]   for school choice in California.
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:16.960]   - Let's take some all in summit money
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.860]   and put it towards that. - Let's get behind it.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.900]   - All in summit profits, we'll put towards this.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.080]   - Yes, let's do it.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.480]   - Let's pull that, I'm in, I'm in.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.880]   Let's put some money behind this.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.400]   - I wanna tell you just to more personalize this issue
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.560]   'cause I really think a lot of people listening
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.420]   struggle with this.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.040]   I entered the pandemic with rules.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.540]   I had rules about devices.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.560]   I had rules about how much time they could be online.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.860]   I had rules around physical fitness, right?
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:48.860]   I had rules around diet and it all went out the window.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.620]   And it became this thing where it was like,
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.380]   feed them the best they can.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.000]   Sometimes they eat lunch with us.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.740]   Sometimes they have to eat lunch by themselves
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.140]   'cause I'm stuck on some stupid Zoom,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.400]   back to back in these dumb,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.800]   dumb meetings 'cause these kids aren't at school.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.400]   Their only way to interact with their friends
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.140]   became video games like Fortnite
[01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.420]   where they could at least talk to their friends.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:10.580]   But then it became an addiction
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:12.680]   where they were doing it for hours and hours.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.520]   - Yep, gross.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.940]   - And now I'm trying to,
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.680]   they gained weight because they weren't physically active.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.680]   And I am trying to unwind as is Nat, as is my ex-wife.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.440]   We're doing it together as a team.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.200]   It is so hard.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.180]   - Absolutely hard.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:28.020]   - So hard.
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:29.100]   - These are addictions.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.240]   - What about all these people
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.040]   who don't have the access to the resources
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.440]   that I have to try to unwind this?
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.600]   And then what happens is I send my kids to this school
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.020]   and oh, they may have a headache.
[01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:38.860]   Guess what?
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.680]   They get sent home.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.020]   And then their brother and sister have to get sent home too
[01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.220]   until you can test and be COVID negative for a day in a row.
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.280]   And so there's yet another day of school loss.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.520]   - Totally nuts.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.360]   - And it's like,
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.820]   this is supposed to be one of the best schools
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.080]   in the country, it's not.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.920]   - Totally nuts.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.760]   - And then I think,
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.600]   what is every other school like then?
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.560]   If this is what my children have to deal with.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.540]   - I think we should make this,
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.080]   we should have this as a major theme for 2020.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.200]   - 2022 for the pod.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.040]   I think it's a very important time.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.980]   - We need to hold educators
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.460]   and teachers unions accountable.
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.300]   - Absolutely.
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.340]   - School boards accountable all around the country
[01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:10.380]   to fix this.
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.100]   This is your responsibility.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.940]   You need to fix it with us.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.260]   - Listen, we held police officers responsible
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.100]   in the last year or two.
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.220]   We've seen this policing being really
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.640]   like a spotlight put on it.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.440]   Well, let's put that same spotlight on teachers
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.400]   and administrators and schools.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.540]   - They'll never do it without competition.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.920]   That's the only way to hold their feet.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.760]   - And you know what?
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.960]   What I learned, Chamath, to build on what you said was,
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.500]   I just decided to get a teacher.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.700]   And obviously I have the means to do it.
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.780]   I know most people don't.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.220]   I certainly didn't have it growing up.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.980]   We could barely afford to exist.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.580]   But I think homeschooling is a viable option.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.780]   So with that 13K, I can tell you five parents
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.060]   who are in an underprivileged area
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.880]   can take that five times 13 and take that,
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:59.760]   what is that, 65K and put it together.
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.640]   And for 65K, they can hire a teacher
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.680]   and they can do a better job with those parents
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.260]   and a teacher for those five kids.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.180]   I guarantee it.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.680]   So let's go to best performing asset of 2022.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.500]   What do you got, Chamath?
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.480]   - This is simple.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.920]   This will be battery metals.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.240]   Lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.380]   Put them in a basket.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.520]   You can be long these things.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.360]   And I think you're gonna-
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:24.200]   - Okay, rapid fire sacks.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.040]   What do you got?
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:25.880]   Best performing asset.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.720]   - I just said series A venture
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:27.920]   because it's pretty unoriginal.
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.760]   It's what I do.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.600]   I think growth got us there.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.740]   It got a little bit overfunded and overheated.
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.360]   And I think the seed stage also,
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:37.180]   there were so many new seed investors.
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:38.720]   Again, it might've been partially
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.300]   because of excess liquidity.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.220]   So series A is still the choke point.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:46.160]   And I think it's still the best area to invest in.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.360]   Innovation's not gonna stop.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.520]   There's gonna be great series A investments next year.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.160]   - I also picked early stage startups
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.740]   because that's where the magic happens.
[01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.980]   I picked early stage, like right before series A.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.440]   I think SPACing,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.560]   direct listings, raising money,
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.720]   people coming down to do the series Bs.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.140]   All of that is creating a pull for more startups.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.620]   And the founders are getting very sophisticated
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.100]   in terms of finding product market fit
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.900]   and scaling globally earlier.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.500]   And that's what's creating these great big outcomes,
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:19.900]   whether it was Uber or Facebook,
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.340]   both figuring out and Airbnb how to go global quickly.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.740]   So my choice for best performing asset of 2022
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.280]   is still early stage startups.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.400]   - So, Mark Zuckerberg, what do you got?
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.220]   - Obviously best performing asset
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.660]   in terms of a multiples basis,
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:37.000]   you're never gonna beat seed stage investing, certainly.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.300]   But I tried to highlight and continue
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.760]   my kind of contrarian bet
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.620]   that we're gonna see increased global conflict next year.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.980]   Again, driven by incumbents trying to hold onto
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.840]   political office and increase inflation
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.160]   and fueling economic growth
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.800]   and the American response to China.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.940]   So in a world of increased global conflict,
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.120]   I think assets that do really well are energy commodities,
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.960]   energy stocks.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.620]   I recently made a big bet on energy stocks, defense stocks,
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:06.580]   and it used to be a gold.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.880]   It could be the case that Bitcoin,
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   sees a role as being a defensive position in portfolios
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.800]   in a world of war and conflict.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.900]   So those are my kind of macro themes for asset.
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:22.480]   - Most anticipated trend of 2022.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.760]   What do you got, Chamath?
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.020]   A trend you're anticipating in 2022.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.700]   - Peer to peer payments,
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.960]   the destruction of traditional rail,
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.880]   it will come out of Africa.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:32.720]   - Great.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.560]   Sax, what do you got?
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.040]   - This is where I had the civil war
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.000]   between progressives and pragmatic liberals.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.420]   So building on what Chamath said,
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.840]   you're already seeing this in the feud
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.280]   between London Breed and Chesa Boudin.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.200]   That is really gonna, I think, blossom next year.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.500]   We have not heard the last of that.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.640]   You saw it in Philadelphia where the mayor,
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.780]   Michael Nutter took on Larry Krasner.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:54.760]   I think you're gonna see it in New York City
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.600]   between Eric Adams and these Manhattan elites.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.300]   You also saw it in Washington, DC,
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.240]   where the progressives were blaming Manchin
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.980]   for losing the build back better.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:08.160]   So this is a civil war that's gonna continue.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.500]   And what Chamath predicted with AOC versus Schumer
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.480]   would certainly play into that.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.000]   So it's grab the popcorn.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.380]   It is the trend I'm anticipating the most.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.840]   - All right, there you go.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.180]   Do you anticipate a similar trend
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.540]   with like the alt-right Trumpians and DeSantis
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.980]   and that kind of thing breaking up?
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.220]   How do you see that playing out?
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.640]   - Not yet.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.180]   Trump isn't on the ballot in 2022.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:33.020]   So I actually think the Republican party
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   is gonna be surprisingly united in 2022.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.780]   I think where the trouble might come in
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.940]   is when we have a Republican primary in 2023.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.740]   And especially if Trump runs,
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.760]   then all hell's gonna break loose.
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.080]   So yeah.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   - Who are the two people who would be most viable
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.100]   against Trump in that 2020, 2023?
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.580]   Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz?
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.000]   - Nikki Haley.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:54.900]   - Nikki Haley?
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.480]   That's gonna be fireworks.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.880]   Freeberg, what do you got?
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.480]   Anticipated trend?
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.700]   - My biggest anticipated trend for 2022
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:04.100]   is gonna be a gold rush in biotech
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.820]   into what I think will become the cover story
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.140]   on magazines throughout the year
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.780]   that humans have discovered the fountain of youth.
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.900]   And this will arise from these investments
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.840]   in what are called Yamanaka factor-based
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.460]   cell reprogramming methods.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:21.260]   I've talked about this on the pod in the past.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:26.080]   A few years ago, scientists identified that four chemicals
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.320]   could trigger gene expression in cells and get
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.120]   the cells to revert to being stem cells.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.940]   And more recently demonstrated that using lower amounts
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.960]   of those chemicals and other what are called kind of
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.700]   epigenetic factors can trigger partial cell reprogramming,
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.720]   which causes cells in the body to act youthful.
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.640]   As a result of those discoveries,
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.040]   an absolute gold rush is now underway.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.860]   More recently, Yuri Milner, Jeff Bezos, Arch,
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.640]   and others put a billion dollars to seed a new company called
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.160]   Altos Labs to pursue therapeutics in this area.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:01.840]   Google has individually funded a company called Calico,
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.660]   led by Art Levinson, the former founder and CEO of Genentech.
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:09.400]   And just recently, Blake Byers and Brian Armstrong
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.140]   announced their new company called New Limit
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.500]   with $100 million of their own personal capital.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:17.220]   All of these companies are pursuing the same effort,
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:21.060]   which is basically causing cells to be youthful,
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.400]   to regenerate in a youthful way.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.000]   And as a result, you see kind of organs and systems in the body
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.680]   act more healthily.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.100]   And there will be magazine covers and 60 minutes articles,
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:36.460]   stories and all sorts of stuff will start to happen in 2022
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.900]   saying, "Oh my gosh."
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.900]   Because the amount of money that's gone in in this year
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.200]   is going to cause breakthroughs and discoveries to start to get
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.660]   published about next year.
[01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.860]   And when that starts to happen and the media and the PR cycle
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.460]   start to kick up, you'll see this become the year of
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.840]   Yamanaka factor based reprogramming.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.600]   And everyone's saying it's gonna be the biggest gold rush
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:57.840]   in biotech since recombinant DNA was used by Genentech in the
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   80s and 90s.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840]   All right.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   And I had most anticipated trend of 2022 being the
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.840]   accredited investor laws are going to change and evolve.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   And it might just be you take a test and you're now accredited.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   It doesn't matter if you won the lottery or you make $200,000 a year.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   And a legal crypto framework is going to happen, I think,
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   at the same time.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.840]   So those regulations combined are going to empower really interesting
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   capital formation on a global basis,
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.680]   whether it's running a syndicate with everybody in the world,
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.680]   including non accredited investors or Dows or those two things merging,
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.680]   or as Balaji is talking about, you know, a cap table over here that's
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.680]   mirrored on a blockchain at the same time and people being able to trade
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.680]   their interest in Chamath's fund or Sax's fund or one of my syndicates
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.680]   with tokens on the internet.
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.680]   And that could become a major unlock where, you know, if you were in...
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:52.680]   I don't have a fund.
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.680]   I run a meager family office.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.520]   Well, if you were in your earlier funds and somebody and there was still stuff
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   trickling to social capital three, the people who have that could sell it back
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   to you or sell it to each other if they wanted to get liquidity.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:08.520]   And that's going to be super interesting, especially if it can happen just globally
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:14.520]   where some person in China decides they want to have access to US funds.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:18.520]   RLPs could just start selling if it was structured that way.
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   Most anticipated film, TV series, media, yada yada for 2020-22.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520]   What do you got?
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:27.360]   Yellowstone season nine.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   I watched the first two episodes.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.360]   It's really great.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   I mean, you forget what a great actor...
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.360]   What's his name is?
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360]   Kevin Costner.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:39.360]   Kevin Costner is a great actor.
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   Yes.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   Yellowstone is great.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360]   I'll be watching next season.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.360]   But what I had down here is Thor Ragnarok.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360]   The writer director Taika Waititi is back.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.360]   If you saw the last Thor movie...
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360]   Ragnarok.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   Ragnarok.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   Ragnarok was the last one.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.360]   The new one is called Thor: Love and Thunder.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.200]   And you know, I'm not sure if it's the best or the worst.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   You know, Thor went from being, I think, one of the most boring Marvel characters in the first two movies to...
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.200]   Totally.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.200]   ...being one of the funniest and...
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.200]   ...you know, most fun in his last movie.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   So I think that sequel will be really good.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   And then the other one is they're doing a prequel show for Game of Thrones called House of the Dragon.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   I'm going to have to watch that.
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   And then probably the Star Wars show I'm looking forward to most would be the Obi-Wan Kenobi show with Ewan McGregor.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.200]   Yes.
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.200]   And Anakin.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:26.200]   It's based on Clone Wars.
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   Yes.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   And I had as well the Obi-Wan show, the Boba Fett show, and the Mandalorian shows all coming back are going to be absolutely bonkers.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:42.200]   And then there's also this token series that's coming out, the prequel, I think, that Amazon is spending a billion dollars on.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.200]   And I think that's landing in 2022.
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   What do you got, Chamath?
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:55.200]   It is the All In Summit in Miami and the birth of All In Media.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:13.200]   So I think that we, by the end of 2022, will have published content, written content, not necessarily by us, but other forms of media interaction that get the truth out to a large swath of humanity.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.200]   Here we go.
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:19.200]   Is this moving beyond just a couple of besties doing a podcast during lockdown?
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200]   What?
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   What?
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:23.200]   Wait, so All In Media, is that a new acronym?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.200]   AIM?
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]   AIM.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200]   What are we doing?
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200]   Should we buy a cable channel and just go 24 hours a day?
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.200]   AIM is the truth.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   AIM Media.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   AIM Media.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   Okay, there you go.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200]   I didn't even know.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200]   This is news to the rest of us, but Chamath is building the media, bro.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200]   Okay, here we go.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200]   Who are we going to hire?
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200]   Tucker.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   There'll be no shortage of folks who will want to come out of the woodwork to work with us on this.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.200]   And I think the goal should just be to make sure we figure out what the real North Star is so that we never deviate.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   And part of the reason that we're doing this is because we're going to be doing this for a long time.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.200]   And we're going to be doing this for a long time.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.200]   And we're going to be doing this for a long time.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.220]   There'll be no shortage of folks who will wanna
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:47.200]   come out of the woodwork to work with us on this.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.620]   And I think the goal should just be to make sure we figure
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.520]   out what the real north star is so that we never deviate.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:56.740]   And part of the biggest thing that we did, guys,
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.220]   was not trying to hustle for some few shekels here or there.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.780]   Which was stupid. Like J Cal wanted to.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.920]   What are you talking about?
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.500]   J Cal, we're gonna talk in a minute
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:09.040]   about the plan for the summer.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   The purity of not wrapping this thing with crappy ads
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.760]   and all kinds of nonsense is we've never lost our way.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.400]   We don't need some stupid deal
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.320]   for some crappy media company.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.280]   We all have independent ways in which we can monetize
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.460]   our lives and our hard work.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.040]   And so we should come to this to always tell the truth.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.020]   I think that that's one of the,
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:29.400]   I will say one of the great innovations and decisions
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.720]   that you championed was not putting ads on it.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.280]   I hear it all the time for people.
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.120]   I mean- We're saving you
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.140]   from yourself, J Cal.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:35.980]   It's an interesting idea where you-
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.920]   Well, whatever, I mean, media's advertising basis.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.760]   I don't think we'd have influenced a show-
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.880]   If you have a media business that's not driven
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.240]   by advertising dollars and not driven by greater,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.080]   by trying to maximize page views and clicks and visits,
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.140]   then it completely changes the equation of what's possible.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.280]   I think this was part of the idea
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.900]   of what publicly funded media was supposed to be,
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.960]   but it obviously got maybe a little bit too far afield.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.040]   Yeah, it was just too-
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.220]   Well, then they started adding ads.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.060]   I don't know if you remember that.
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.320]   They lost some funding and they're like,
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.740]   "Okay, we're gonna go for sponsorships."
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.120]   They're not ads, they're sponsorships.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.720]   So you're saying we're the new PBS.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.780]   No, it's something different.
[01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:15.360]   I mean, this is- We do this without any expectation
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   of financial reward.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   We do it because we enjoy it.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.400]   And so- Well, except for you, J Cal, you've been-
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.180]   No, I mean, I have other things that make money.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.180]   J Cal's doing pretty fucking good right now.
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.180]   Hey, Pogba Bear!
[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:26.180]   Pogba Bear!
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.180]   J Cal's doing okay right now.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.180]   All right, you're clubbing the baby seal now.
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.180]   Let's get it, yeah.
[01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.180]   900 members at thesyndicate.com.
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.180]   Boop!
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:32.180]   Plug.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:33.180]   Boop!
[01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.180]   Sass Syndicate just did our first deal.
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.180]   Boop!
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.180]   Sass Syndicate just did our first deal.
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.180]   Boop!
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.180]   Sass Syndicate just did our first deal.
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.180]   Boop!
[01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.820]   I didn't know we were doing this category.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.820]   I will promise to watch some TV.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.820]   I will doubt and Abby season 16 of Doubt and Abby.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.820]   He doesn't watch TV.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.820]   He doesn't have any.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.820]   What do you got?
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.660]   I would like to watch reruns of Doctor Who.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.720]   What BBC show that nobody watches are you gonna recommend?
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.720]   Doesn't matter.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   I mean, come on.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.780]   What show from Finland with subtitles are-
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.780]   I don't know.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:04.100]   You know, I spend a lot of time watching like esoteric videos and stuff I find on YouTube.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.360]   I really think it's so interesting.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.780]   It's such a different way of consuming media.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.020]   Just tell us what video game you're playing.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.140]   Wes Anderson is putting out a porno.
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:15.260]   Oh, I was watching this Paul Thomas Anderson and it's so similar to Target.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.260]   It's like looking at a painting.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:19.260]   And a greasy gulch shot will be of a vernicular going up and down the mountain.
[01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.460]   I felt like I was in the Louvre watching this movie.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.460]   All right.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.460]   What video game are you playing?
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.520]   I called, uh, I called Freeburg on the phone to talk him off a ledge when he was going
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:27.900]   crazy on the group chat.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.220]   And he's like, I can't talk him on a video game.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.220]   What video game is that?
[01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:35.420]   I was actually playing a video game by Annapurna Interactive, which is Larry Ellison's daughter's
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.860]   um, media production company.
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:37.860]   And apparently, I didn't know this.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.860]   They had a video game already.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:42.300]   They had a video game arm and the video games are, and the game I was playing was called
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.720]   Maquette.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.540]   And um, you kind of, you kind of have this like interesting movie, like poetic experience
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:49.540]   as you play the game.
[01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.540]   So it's not really just designed to be action packed.
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.540]   And I don't know.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:55.540]   I thought it was a very interesting new way of, um, entertaining oneself.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.840]   Okay, we can move on.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:59.800]   It was highly stimulating.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.020]   She made a simulation of a biology lab and uh, you actually get different beaker sizes
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.260]   and you have different sub proteins that you start with.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:08.700]   You get to buy all of these lab equipment.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.980]   You want, but it needs a virtual currency.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   It's kind of like a simulation.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:12.980]   It's like the Sims, but with-
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.980]   In order to get that virtual currency, you must first mine it.
[01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.380]   And the way that you mine is by solving mathematical equations.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:23.820]   I made a cruelty free fish device dish, uh, in my laboratory because of the genocide of
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.820]   fish.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.620]   That was a little controversial take last week.
[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.620]   I got DMs from people.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.940]   That was a spicy take, Freeburg.
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.560]   Did you get any blow back from that spicy take last week?
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560]   The spiciest of-
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560]   I did.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560]   I did.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.420]   The spiciest of all time.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.420]   I got DMs from people.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420]   I sent me a note directly.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   Was it really?
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   Cause I, people are like you're equating-
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.420]   Well, I think the co- well, here's the thing.
[01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:47.840]   The comment I made that I think really triggered people was I said that, um, animal agriculture
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:53.020]   is worse than human slavery and, uh, maybe I'll just address it now real quick.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:59.480]   You know, I think the point of view that people took away from that was that I diminished,
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:05.220]   you know, the pain and the, the resonance, uh, in today's kind of socioeconomic context
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.400]   of, uh, human slavery.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.020]   Particularly recently in America.
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:11.300]   Um, and that wasn't my intention at all.
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.300]   Uh,
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.300]   Clearly not your intention.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.400]   What I'm trying to highlight is, you know, first of all, human slavery has been around
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.800]   as long as humans have been around, right?
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:24.340]   For 10,000 years back to ancient Egypt, the enslavement of humans, the removal of opportunity
[01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:29.680]   and freedom granted to every living being, um, is, is certainly manifest in the form
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.680]   of human slavery.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:32.940]   And we kind of take it as a very acute pain point.
[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.240]   What I was highlighting is every year, over a hundred billion land-based animals are going
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.240]   to be killed.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:44.240]   They're killed and they're born and put in, in chains and put in jails and then murdered
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.180]   and eaten by humans as routine.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:52.640]   And we don't like lift our head up and recognize just how serious and how skilled this, this,
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.860]   um, you know, this behavior is.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:59.060]   The industrialization of this process, uh, is really abhorrent and there's videos you
[01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.060]   can watch.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.140]   And I think when you watch them, you'll recognize just how painful it is.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.140]   This is delicious.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:04.140]   I knew it was coming.
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.140]   Don't do it Chamath.
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.080]   No, but I do think that Chamath is a very important.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.140]   You know, Chamath voice in this is, is really the voice that's kept us from ever becoming
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:12.720]   an issue because it's not human.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:14.320]   We don't kind of pay attention to it.
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:17.560]   And I'm just trying to highlight that there is something that is at such an extraordinary
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:20.900]   scale that we don't pay attention to that one day we'll wake up and we'll be like, Oh
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.900]   my God, how do we miss that?
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.220]   I have complete agreement with you, Freeberg.
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:29.820]   If you look at all life being precious and you say the life of a cow, the life of a dog,
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.640]   the life of a human, these are all lives.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.920]   The scale of suffering is, uh, greater.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:41.660]   And these animals, these animals can problem solve.
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.020]   They can feel emotion.
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:47.640]   They can recognize, they can recognize things happening to them and to their loved ones
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:48.920]   and their family members.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.480]   And I think that in the context of that, to cause pain and suffering on those animals
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.740]   and on those creatures at the scale that we do is something that's just mind blowing to
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.740]   me.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.840]   And I expect that one day we will wake up and be like, I cannot believe we allowed our
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:01.920]   society to do that.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:05.360]   But I do think that we need to solve Chamath's problem, which is how do you make something
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.760]   that's frigging delicious?
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   How do you make it cheaper?
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.760]   Hold on a second.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   It's not a problem.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.100]   Like my, my perspective is I understand where you're coming from.
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:17.680]   I respect your point of view, but here's my point of view, which is we evolved to superior
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:23.140]   superiority in an evolutionary process that was not preordained.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.200]   Okay.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:28.960]   And we are now in a position where we are allowed to consume things that we choose.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.720]   Now there is also a claim that you could make that, you know, what a tiger or a lion should
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.600]   not be attacking and killing a gazelle.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.760]   Because you know what that's causing suffering to the gazelle or blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:44.420]   At the end of the day, how we choose to go and consume the things that we need for sustenance
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.840]   is a choice that we can make.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.740]   And there are probably better choices we can make over time.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:53.600]   But at the end of the day, I think that this was a reasonable evolution of humanity and
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.540]   human ingenuity and intellect.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.220]   And I don't feel guilty about that.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.400]   I don't weigh the suffering of animals the same way I weigh the suffering of human beings.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   I don't.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.440]   And I would argue that when we were apes in the jungle, and we didn't have the choice,
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.400]   I would wholeheartedly agree with you.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.740]   But today, we are a people that do have the choice.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.740]   What choice do we have?
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:16.900]   And it's because we have the choice to not eat meat and still survive and still be happy,
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:17.900]   that we can make a better choice.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.940]   But it doesn't taste good.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.300]   Like there's a part of my soul, I'll just be very honest with you.
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.300]   And I agree.
[01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.540]   And that's why I think we need to solve that problem.
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:25.760]   And that's why I believe-
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.640]   It's not a problem.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.380]   If you made an alternative for you that tasted good, and was as affordable as the alternative,
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.780]   which is actually killing an animal, you would choose it.
[01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.280]   And we haven't given you that solution yet.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.620]   And when I say we, I mean, call it the techno food people.
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.180]   But there is a tremendous amount of money going into this area.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:48.080]   And we will devise artificially produced meat that will not be made by killing an animal,
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   but will be made in a lab that looks and tastes identical.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.660]   When will we have a steak or a piece of sushi?
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.040]   Just give us a year over on your list.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.500]   You'll have a piece of sushi in three years.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.500]   You will have...
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500]   Right.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.440]   You will be able to go taste chicken next year.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:01.220]   It'll be very, very expensive.
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   Okay.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.120]   But cell-based meat will be available.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.120]   And then let's get to the-
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.120]   I think at a commercial scale within the next year.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.040]   We're going to get our steak.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.040]   That's really what it's about.
[01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:13.440]   David, my commitment to you is I will do a taste test whenever you say...
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.440]   You call the...
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.440]   You pick the place, the time.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.440]   Totally.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440]   I will show up.
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.880]   And if it's better, I will never eat meat again.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880]   Okay.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   We're not ready for that.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880]   And that's a great commitment.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   All right.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.880]   And I am similar in the commitment.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   But in the meantime...
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   Oh, don't tell him.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:28.880]   It's not tasty.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   It's distasteful.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:35.960]   But I will say, Friedberg, if you're going to have a party and it's only vegan, you're
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.000]   going to have to put that on the invite.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.200]   Because I came thinking you were going to feed me.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   JKL came to my party.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   There was no meat.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.200]   He was really upset.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.720]   He was going around my party being like, "What the hell is this?
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   There's no meat in this party.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   What am I doing here?"
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.720]   I went into the kitchen.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720]   I said, "Can you make me a hamburger?"
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.720]   The woman from wherever-
[01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.720]   I made...
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.720]   Napa was like, "I've never touched meat in 30 years."
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720]   Whatever.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:56.460]   I made the most incredible ribeye on Christmas Eve.
[01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:57.460]   Oh my God.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:58.460]   Ribeye.
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.460]   All right, everybody.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:04.960]   For the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya with great hair, a touch of gray, never looked
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.960]   better.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.360]   The consultant of science, David Friedberg, and Tucker Carlson's bestie, GOP front runner,
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.960]   David Sachs, super spreading COVID.
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   Super spreading the truth.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   Super spreading the truth.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:18.960]   Super spreading the truth.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:26.620]   David Sachs from an undisclosed bestie hideaway, which we all know but we won't say.
[01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:28.960]   I'm Jake Howe, and we'll see you in 2022.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:29.960]   Bye-bye.
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:30.960]   It's been a great year.
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:31.960]   Bye-bye.
[01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.960]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:33.960]   Rain man, David Sachs.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:35.960]   And instead, we open source it to the fans, and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:36.960]   Love you, Wesley.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:37.960]   I'm the queen of kinwa.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:44.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.960]   I'm going all in.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:46.960]   Besties are gone.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.960]   Goal 13.
[01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:48.960]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:49.960]   Sachs.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:50.960]   Oh, man.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   I'm the dasher.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   We meet you at the end of the year.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:53.960]   Oh, man.
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.960]   I'm the best.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960]   We're going all in.
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.960]   We're going all in.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:57.960]   We're going all in.
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   They're just like sexy, sexy.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.700]   We're not a bitch, we're just like a bunch of...
[01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.400]   We should all just get a room and have one big huge orgy, because they're all just useless.
[01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.400]   It's like this sexual tension, but we just need to release it.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.400]   Wet your beat, wet your beat.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.400]   We need to get merch.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.400]   Bitches are fat.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400]   I'm doing all it all.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.400]   I'm doing all it all.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   We're just like sexy, sexy.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400]   We're not a bitch, we're just like a bunch of...
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   What?
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   What?
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   We need to get merch.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   Bitches are fat.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.400]   I'm doing all it.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:28.140]   I'm going all in
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:29.140]   .
