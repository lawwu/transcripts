[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.960]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.720]   Before we get started, please be praying for Pastor John,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.880]   who is right now in the midst of a very busy ministry month
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.640]   here in January to start the year.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.320]   He began January, of course,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.700]   preaching at the Cross Conference in Louisville.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.840]   A little later, he spoke at the G3 Conference in Atlanta,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.960]   and now he prepares for the 2019
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.160]   BCS Pastors Conference on Christian Joy.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.280]   That conference is here in Minneapolis.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.880]   It begins on Monday and ends on Wednesday.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.640]   So your prayers would be appreciated for him,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.600]   for the organizers,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.440]   and everyone who will be in attendance there.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.600]   Hope to see you there.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.040]   And with Pastor John tied up,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.960]   we're joined this week by Pastor Tim Keller
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.480]   from New York City to talk vocation
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   and about his really helpful book,
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.200]   "Every Good Endeavor, Connecting Your Work to God's Work."
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   I have a handful of questions to toss his way.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   Admittedly, it's a bit scattershot.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.320]   We'll talk to college graduates,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.320]   we'll talk to parents,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.120]   and we'll talk to Christians who feel stuck in their jobs.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.200]   And I began by asking Dr. Keller,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000]   why does a biblical view of vocation
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.160]   seem so underdeveloped in the lives
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.580]   of so many Christian workers today?
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.080]   - Well, I think it's probably because of the fact
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.480]   that the church doesn't have a uniform.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   There's not a consensus view on how the church
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.520]   is supposed to relate to culture more generally.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.360]   And actually there's another book,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360]   this book "Center Church," in which I try to tackle that.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200]   I don't tackle it in the "Every Good Endeavor" book.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440]   But basically you've got very different views
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.800]   on how the church should relate to the culture.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.800]   It's based on very different views about common grace.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.440]   It's based on somewhat different views
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.600]   about actually the role of the institutional church.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.480]   And because of that, I think the doctrine of vocation,
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.640]   which everybody says, oh yeah, it's really important,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.760]   really important that all work is a calling from God
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.160]   and that where work is important
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600]   and that God has to come, you need to bring your faith
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.160]   and God to bear on your work.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   Yep, that's important.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.840]   But then the problem is it gets caught up,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   that doctrine of vocation gets caught up
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.480]   in this controversy.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.320]   And then people come out, really,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.800]   since there's no consensus on how to relate to the culture,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.380]   there's no consensus on what vocation means.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.640]   - Right, I'm thankful for the ways you clear up
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160]   some of the confusion and help us work towards clarity.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.720]   In fact, early in your book, "Every Good Endeavor,"
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   you write two sentences that I think capture
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.240]   a major theme in the book.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.640]   You write this, quote, "A job is a vocation
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.960]   "only if someone else calls you to do it
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.280]   "and you do it for them rather than for yourself.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.200]   "Thinking of work mainly as a means of self-fulfillment
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.220]   "and self-realization slowly crushes the person
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.500]   "and undermines society itself."
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.040]   That is a powerful statement.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.400]   So where does this crushing individualism
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.520]   in the workplace come from?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.080]   Where does it originate?
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.000]   - Well, the basic idea, the basic secular idea
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   is that there is no meaning in life.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.160]   We're here by accident.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.800]   There's no overarching, there's no moral absolutes.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.920]   There's no, we weren't put here for a purpose.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.800]   But then what most of the folks say,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.000]   I've seen this in many forums,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.800]   they say, well, of course, there's no meaning in life.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.360]   You have to create your own meaning.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.040]   So I've seen a lot of secular people and atheists say,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.680]   yes, of course, there's no meaning to life,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.280]   but that doesn't mean that we can't live a fruitful life
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.740]   and a happy life, you create your own meaning.
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.560]   Well, now, actually, somebody should drill down on that
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.760]   at some point, maybe I will,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.120]   and say it's impossible to create your own meaning.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.980]   If you create your own meaning, you don't have it.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.660]   But basically what they mean is
[00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.440]   you decide what is right or wrong for you,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.160]   you decide what you think is important,
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.200]   and then you live according to that.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.220]   But in that case, there's no calling.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.360]   There's no sense that I am,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   there is something higher than me
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.420]   that's more important than me.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.760]   So you see, if you don't have that,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.460]   then there's no such thing as sacrifice and servanthood.
[00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.880]   Everything you do is selfish.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.520]   Everything you do is selfish.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.080]   And there's also no real hope.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.320]   There's no real hope for the future.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.400]   You just basically are trying to create
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.040]   a little bit of happiness for yourself
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.060]   in this brief span of time that you have,
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.320]   but in the end, there's nothing but darkness.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.920]   So when you put those two things together,
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.360]   the idea of vocation, and the idea of hope,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.600]   and the idea of servanthood,
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.440]   and the idea of sacrifice and unselfishness,
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.840]   it all actually depends on there being
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.320]   something more important than you,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.720]   something that's already there, like God.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.200]   So the whole idea of vocation's gone,
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.680]   and work is nothing but a way of getting ahead,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.320]   and it is crushing us, I think.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.200]   - Yeah, and self-sacrifice is, of course,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   central to the biblical idea of vocation.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.920]   And I think that that idea confronts a lot of Christians
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.880]   who maybe don't like their work,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   they don't like going to work.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is a really practical question,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.840]   but if a Christian shows up for work on Monday morning,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   and they are irritable towards others, what's wrong?
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.400]   - Well, in the book, I talk about the fact
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   that the gospel is brought to bear on our work
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.280]   in a couple of different ways.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   One of them is the heart.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.440]   One of them is the grumpiness, and the anger,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.600]   and only doing what I have to do to get by,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.480]   and that means it's a lack of a gospel character.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.920]   The gospel's supposed to make you grateful,
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.080]   supposed to make you humble,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.040]   supposed to give you inner peace,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.200]   it's supposed to make you generous in your spirit,
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.640]   and if you just don't show all those things at work,
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.320]   it means that the gospel hasn't really,
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.760]   you're not really letting the gospel change the heart
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.600]   the way it ought to.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.320]   And by the way, in the long run,
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.880]   a gospel-changed heart usually is,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.040]   makes you a pretty good worker,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.600]   makes people want to work with you,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.280]   makes people want to be on your team,
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.600]   makes employers happy with your work.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.560]   So in the long run, having a gospel-changed heart
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   actually is pretty practical in the field of work.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.800]   - Yeah, for sure it is practical.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.200]   And this success requires some level of diligence
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   and focus too in the workplace,
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.840]   and I think for the first time I heard the phrase
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.880]   God of options was from Mark Dever out in D.C.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.640]   He used this phrase God of options.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.160]   He was talking about young pastors
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.600]   who take a pastorate in a local church
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.920]   but are always only half in,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.400]   always eyeing a different church,
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.320]   always looking for a newer church,
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.400]   a better position within it.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   Similarly, it seems like this temptation
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.040]   is for all Christians in the workforce
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   who are half in on one particular job
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.480]   and so drawn to this God of options idea
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.920]   that they're never all in in one particular job,
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.320]   always looking for the next one,
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.680]   the next position to come along,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.600]   something newer, bigger, grander.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.120]   Do you see this?
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.440]   - Yes, I'm being a little ironic,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   but what I said, just say yes,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.040]   but your question was well stated, and I agree with it.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   I can just add this.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.120]   People are looking for the more fulfilling thing.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.040]   Very often they say, you know,
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.160]   I'd like something that is just a little bit,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.440]   a job that's just a little more exciting to me,
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.440]   this job's a little boring to me, and better paying.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.600]   And I think the Christian understanding of vocation
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   is if you produce a product, if you produce something
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.400]   that makes people's lives better,
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.200]   even if it's a rather boring process to do it,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.280]   you're doing God's work.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.640]   You're caring for God's creation.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.800]   You're serving people's needs.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.160]   Why does it have to be so incredibly,
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.120]   why does the process have to be incredibly fulfilling
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.360]   when you know that you are doing something
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.720]   that helps people?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.320]   And I do think that that's part of what I mean
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   when I say that we've lost the idea of calling,
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.280]   and we are looking now at work as ways of fulfillment,
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.680]   and that actually in the end crushes you,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.040]   so you're always half out, as you said.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.920]   - Yep, well, I wanna return to this topic
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.720]   of what you would say to a Christian
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.840]   who feels stuck in their job,
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.080]   because I think there's more to say here,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.400]   and I know there's a number of listeners
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.080]   who have asked questions about this over the years,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.480]   and I wanna have you address that more next time.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.520]   I also want you to talk to parents
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.040]   about how to train their kids
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.680]   towards embracing diligent labor.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.320]   There's a lot to cover next time with Tim Keller
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.440]   talking with us about his book,
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.880]   Every Good Endeavor, Connecting Your Work to God's Work.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.720]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.560]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:32.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
