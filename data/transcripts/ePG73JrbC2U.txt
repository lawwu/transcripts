[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   A number of years ago, Jack Eisgott, he and Bill Bernstein could do an informal chat as
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200]   part of the agenda.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   We all know what Jack wants, Jack gets.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200]   So it's become a regular part of our conference agenda ever since.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200]   It's now affectionately known as the Fireside Chat.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   Jack is here, but Jack's companion for the Fireside Chat is a retired neurologist.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   He's written a number of best-selling titles on both finance and economics history.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:51.880]   He holds both a Ph.D. in chemistry and an M.D.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.720]   Please welcome one of the smartest guys I know, Bill Bernstein.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   [Applause]
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.720]   Well, you know, before we start, you know, Steve Dunn told this lovely story.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.560]   I'm going to tell a little bit of a story out of this, out of school, because it had
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.120]   to do with a lunch I had with a representative from another large passively-based mutual
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.320]   fund company that has, I think it's no secret, a succession problem.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.300]   This company has excellent management, this management has no succession issues at all.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.800]   They have a very deep bench in that regard.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.800]   But their problem is ownership.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.240]   They've got two owners, and the owners want to get their, justifiably, their just deserts
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240]   out of it.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.040]   And there's, in their eyes, really only two ways to do this.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.400]   One is to have an initial public offering, which would be bad news.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   And then the other solution would be to sell to a larger financial corporate entity, which
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.560]   would be even worse news.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.720]   And so I've suggested to them multiple times that they Vanderbiltize, which is basically
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.000]   to sell themselves to their shareholders, so that after ten years or so, they wind up
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.260]   being owned by their shareholders, like Vanderbilt does.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.640]   And they looked at me and said, "Well, Jack Bogle did this, how much did he charge?"
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.640]   And I said, "Zero.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   Gave it away for free."
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.440]   And they said, "Well, why would he do that?"
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   And you have to know me, I tend to blurt things out.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   I said, "Well, because he's a Mitch."
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   [laughter]
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080]   So, you know, of course they're not going to listen to me.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.860]   But I thought I'd, excuse me, start off, Jack, and ask you about your personal feelings
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.560]   about the recent Nobel Prize laureates.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.600]   I'm not going to ask you about Hanson, because he's kind of a mechanic.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.920]   And so I'll ask you about what you think the legacy of Schiller and Thomin is, what you've
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.640]   learned from them, where you disagreed from them, and, you know, their work is not entirely
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.640]   consistent with each other.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   >> To say the least.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   And so I'd like your opinion on that, too.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.640]   >> Well, I talked a little bit about this, I think, before you got here, Bill, but let
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.680]   me just kind of reiterate what I think.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.720]   One is, I don't see how efficient markets can even be a hypothesis, because it's sometimes
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   right and sometimes wrong.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.440]   A hypothesis does not have a whole lot of Swiss cheese in it.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:40.120]   And the, I think the one place that both Schiller and Thomin agree is that in the long run the
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.360]   markets are a lot more efficient than they are in the short run, and I would totally
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   endorse that.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.100]   But the data are crystal clear that they tend to move toward, if you want to call it an
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.560]   equilibrium, I don't want to use too high-powered, highfalutin phrases, because that's just not
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.860]   my style and not my preference, but it's, efficient markets, however, have nothing to
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.720]   do, zero, nada, with my creation of the index funds.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.760]   I never heard of Thomin then, as you all know, and I didn't believe in efficient markets,
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.640]   and I spent a lot of time in my books saying, you know, there is the quantitative school,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.720]   guys out of Wells Fargo were very good, and they rented some money for us for a while,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   it didn't work that well for about 15 years, and then it didn't work out any more, other
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.020]   than the sort of asset allocation stuff.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.320]   They're all quants deeply into trying to prove the market is efficient.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.760]   The Sansonite well-known pension plan, it was the first pension account to do this,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.360]   and it failed, because they picked the wrong index.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.520]   I take some pride in the fact that they finally picked the right index after Payne-Garden
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   500 came out.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.560]   I don't think they were necessarily following it, they needed a good index, and they picked
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.560]   the bad one.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560]   So, the efficient markets have never had anything to do with my idea.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.680]   My idea was that, this is, I've mentioned it before and I'll mention it again, is all
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.720]   you need is the CNH, which is the Consistent Cost Matters Hypothesis, and that is true
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   under any momentary time period or any internal time period.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720]   And that is the less cost you pay, the more your share of the market returns goes up,
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   whether the market is efficient or inefficient, long-term, short-term, whatever it is.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:27.860]   So, I think efficient markets is overrated, but not as bad as Shiller says, has done more
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.160]   damage to economic thinking than any idea in the history of economic thought, or some
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.480]   understatement like that.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.040]   He really did say that in one of his books.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.480]   So they disagree, and I think it's kind of interesting, and in a way I like it when they
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.760]   award the Nobel Prize to two people who think exactly the opposite of one another.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.720]   As to Bob Shiller, he's very creative, very smart.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.440]   I like the idea of an ease of the 15-year moving earnings target to calculate the PE.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.800]   It's a long way from perfect, but it's probably better than using the last year or the next
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   year pumped up with expectations, and so, and he's a good thinker.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.840]   He has some very complicated ideas, which I think are oversimplified.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   For example, he wants to create a whole bunch of new financial instruments to protect us
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.240]   from problems of our home mortgages and that kind of thing.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   And the problem with any aggregator of any kind of asset class, or whatever you want
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.320]   to call it, or any kind of derivative, is they cost money.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   The system takes money out.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.360]   So it works less well for investors in the group that does when it's on paper, because
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.080]   they don't count, they do the pricing, they don't count the intermediary share.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   So are they both worthy of the Nobel Prize?
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.680]   I would have no idea, but heck, the Nobel Prize Committee has been all over this, and
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.840]   they decide they are.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.880]   So I salute them, but that doesn't mean I have to follow every word that they have.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.640]   And I am, this will really surprise you, totally un-intimidated by the idea of taking them
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.040]   both on a little bit, which I did in that Wall Street Journal letter, which may or may
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   not ever get published.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.440]   And it's such a good letter, Emily hated it, Michael hated it, and the more they hated
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   it, the more I wanted it.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   I mean, I did try to adjust to what they said a little bit, kind of smack in the face sort
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   of thing.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   But anything that gets us thinking about these issues, and particularly issues, I mean, I've
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.480]   always spent a lot of time on issues that are opposed to what I say, I think it's much
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   more valuable.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.520]   And by the way, what an honor it is for me to be with this guy, right off the hospital
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   bed.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   Now you're making me look like a piper.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.520]   I hate that.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   And so, anything that makes you think, you know, maybe I'm wrong, and I have been known
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.200]   to think that for a moment or two.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.920]   So you try and learn, you try and keep up with the academic journals, and I can say
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:04.240]   this about what Taylor mentioned, his citation for the journal, news story, and op-ed on
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.840]   Monday, the efficient markets had nothing to do with my creation of the index fund.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:17.920]   But it's worthwhile to look at that hypothesis, to challenge it, and I'm pretty good at that,
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.840]   but I just want to add that there was an article from a Nobel Prize winner that in fact did
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.160]   inspire my creation of the first index fund, and that would be Paul Samuelson's article
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:38.880]   in the first edition of the Journal of Portfolio Management, called "Challenge to Judgment".
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   And Paul Samuelson, and he's in my group, he doesn't get into what efficient markets
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.960]   are, he says, "Show me the root evidence that managers can win."
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.760]   And no one ever showed him any root evidence that managers can win, and they haven't shown
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   him yet.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:00.120]   So he and I were, he's the inspiration for me, not Gene Plomkin.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.040]   So I said that to the Wall Street Journal, and Paul's, if someone like Paul Samuelson
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.520]   turns out to be one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet, he's just so brilliant, it's an
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.760]   embarrassment to be in the same room with him, but I get over it.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:20.240]   And he's a very, in a lot of ways, a humble guy, not, I mean, like academics, he maybe
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.280]   has a touch of arrogance, but I know a particular person who's not an academic who has a touch
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.280]   of arrogance too.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.280]   I'm not gonna identify him.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.440]   He's right in front of me, and I'm not talking about Bill.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:39.320]   So I think he should get his credit, 'cause it really did help me sell the IDD index fund
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.320]   to the board.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.280]   I'd done all the data myself, and then, you know, line by line, calculator by calculator,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.120]   in 1975, before, that was the first thing I did, was bring that index fund to the board
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.880]   of directors, after Vanguard started in May, and it was on their desk by, I think, September,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.360]   August or September, and they didn't know what to do about it, you know, it had, it
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.560]   was being managed, but not actively managed, and that was a hurdle.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.600]   The data was a hurdle, but when you have Paul Samuelson, you've got a pretty potent weapon.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.760]   I mean, it shows you're not nuts, it may be all it shows, but that was enough.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.080]   Yeah, I'm gonna do two very fast observations, and then I'll segue into another question.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   The first observation is that when I fall face-first into my mashed potatoes, I will
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   not want for lack of medical attention in this audience.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.840]   The second is more serious, that, you know, I think Schiller is one of the most brilliant,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   he has a peculiar intellect, a peculiar personality, that makes, that gives him his brilliant intellect,
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   I think.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.520]   It's sort of a very dissociated way of looking at the world, and he's one of the few people
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   whose macroeconomic analyses and financial terms I listen to, because he's so rational,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:59.440]   he's so divorced from popular thinking, but a lot of the ideas that he has are truly bad
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.480]   ideas, and one of the ones is the one that Jack just mentioned, which is derivatizing
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.040]   housing markets, you know, theoretically they can be used to hedge, wonderful, so can most
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.680]   other derivatives be used to hedge, but you know that's not what they're going to be used
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   for.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   You know they're going to be used to destabilize the system, and not to stabilize it, they're
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.680]   going to be used for speculating.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.680]   With that said, I want to come up with something, talk about something else that Gene Fonda
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.000]   has said, which gets him off the reservation, at least, but I think it's extremely important,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.840]   which is that one thing I think we've learned over the past several years, and we didn't
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.560]   know it already, is how important banks are, alright?
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.840]   You know, first there's police stations and courts, then there's banks, then there's hospitals,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.000]   because if you don't have banks, there aren't hospitals, and we have an unstable banking
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.800]   system, and one of Gene Fonda's ideas, Jack, is that about a quarter of bank capitalization
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.200]   should be equity, alright?
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.400]   Equity can be loaned, it's not going to be idle money sitting there, it's money that
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:11.600]   can earn a profit for the owners, and it's kind of a naive idea, but at the same time,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.200]   it has a certain appeal and also a certain support within some of the more serious members
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   of the banking industry, so I want to know what you think about our banking structure
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.800]   in general, and also what you think about Professor Obama's suggestion.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.600]   Okay, well, on the banking system, I even go beyond that, Bill, and say, you know, what's
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:42.800]   happening to the world of capitalism, and I think the most worrisome trend is growing
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   concentration everywhere, larger and larger, and the banks say, I mean, listen to Jamie
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.400]   Dimon, listen to anybody else in the banking area, we have to be large because our clients
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.000]   are so large, our customers, the borrowers, and the lenders are so large, we have to be
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.200]   able to accommodate them, and that is true, so I don't know how to get out of this mess,
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.400]   but to have the concentration of our banking system is in fact larger, I think the top
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:19.000]   five banks have over 50% of the deposits of all banks now, and it's probably 40% of what
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.800]   happens with these little banks and smaller banks, not little banks at all, smaller banks,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.400]   they merge into a big one, and that concentration gets worse and worse, and every corporate
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.800]   merger makes the clients get bigger and bigger and demanding of more and more big banking
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.200]   services, and in the long run, we get a whole system of oligopoly, I'm troubled by the fact
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.800]   it's also happening, as I've said before, in the mutual fund industry, where the top
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:51.200]   five firms have almost 50% of the assets, and they're all index firms, you know, you
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.600]   like diversity in capitalism, corporate America, diversity, I'm not talking about all this
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.000]   gender stuff, just in terms of the number of participants in the system, the greater
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.600]   number of participants in the market system, the more you're likely to get efficient markets,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.400]   and it's all dwindling and getting larger and larger, I don't know what to do about
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.800]   that, it's well known, I haven't done any research on this, but I will get into it one
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.000]   day, thanks Michael, be ready, but the number of stocks that we used to have, the Wilshire
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.200]   5000, and it's now called the total stock market index, I guess it's Dow Jones or whoever
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   does it, and it got up to 7,000 stocks in the year 2000, now it's gone, that's way
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   above, it's the 5000 it originally began with, and now it's down to I think 3200, over half
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   of the stocks that were in it at the market high are gone, and some of that is by merger,
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.800]   some of that is because the tech stocks came and then they went, and you know, it's interesting
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.600]   to me, it's a vital intellectual question, where did those companies go, and what happened
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.600]   to them, and to the extent they're mergers, why do we do all those mergers, and I happen
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.400]   to be a real, this is really going to surprise you, a real cynic about these corporate mergers,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.600]   I think they're done for one of two reasons, or maybe both of them at the same time, and
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.400]   that is one, bigger corporations pay their executives bigger salaries, so the CEO wants
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   to do a merger, he thinks he knows everything, the board thinks he knows everything, and
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:30.800]   they pay him a lot of money for doing pretty much nothing, I think, and so that's one part,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:36.400]   and the other part is, it muddies the accounting waters, you do a merger, and nobody knows
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   proforma, this, proforma, that, and all of a sudden the shoddy record looks like a good
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.400]   record, and in terms of earnings per share, and they're just basically not credible and
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.400]   not believable, but we take anything that is quantified, that we can, it's the perils
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   of numeracy, one of the talks I gave all over again, and reminding me of a thing in Einstein's
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   office, which Bill knows well, I'm sure, and that is, there's a sign, it's said to be a
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   sign in Albert Einstein's office, the former office of the Princeton Institute of Advanced
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   Study, saying there's some things that count that can't be counted, and there's some things
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   that can be counted that don't count, and you know, and here I am, a big math guy, beta
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   mogul, the data devil, and skeptical about the idea that we can quantify everything, and
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   that's why I'm pleased to have gotten this article in the Financial Analytics Journal,
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   where my guesses about the cost of transaction costs, about advisory costs, about cash drag,
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   aren't just estimates, but it's better to have the estimates there, up or down, do what
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.400]   you will with them, anybody can change the math, and then ignore these huge costs that
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.400]   come along with the fund expense ratios, so I'll be glad to have that out of the way,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   but on banking, I had a chapter in my book called The Battle of the Soul of Capitalism,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   not a chapter, but a take out from another chapter, it's called Bring Back Glass-Steagall,
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   and that's what we should have done, but we couldn't do that, so we get the Volcker Rule,
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   which is, I think, 198 pages in the Glass-Steagall Act, 65 pages, because you're trying to fuss
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.400]   around the edges of the system, and it still hadn't gotten anywhere, it still hadn't been
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   implemented, so you get a lot of people, banks, these get into the big issues that confront
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.400]   the American Republic today, and that is the power of money in the system, but banks are
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   out there with these high-paid lobbyists fighting every comma, every paragraph, everything they
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   can with all their might, and they can, of course, out-think the civil servants of the
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   SEC, and so on, and it's not putting down the SEC, it's just, they've gotten into such
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   a complicated mess, but you tell me that Jamie Dunn can take you through the annual report,
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   or J.P. Morgan, and explain every item to you, and I'll say, "I'm not hanging by my
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.400]   thumbs in the latter."
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   Yeah, that actually raises a couple of subsidiary questions, the first of which is, if you're
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   a libertarian, you blame Sarbanes-Oxley for a decrease in the number of publicly traded
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   companies, do you think that's a valid argument?
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   I'd like to look at the data, but I doubt it very much, it's an easy out, you know,
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.400]   it's so demanding to be a public company and not be a private company.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   First place, it's much easier said than done to do that, and second, at a certain level,
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   when you get to really big corporations, going private is impossible.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   I think one of the challenges to the long-term investment management business is as our investment
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   universe shrinks, it's the kind of things, Bill, that very few people, but you, are even
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   thinking about, and that's why we need you.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:58.400]   I'm not sure who needs me these days, except my granddaughter.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.400]   Well, that leads me to an actually very leading question, which is the quality of financial
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.400]   regulation during the most current administration.
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:15.400]   We had a woman who was the SEC chairman, who as far as I can see did not have great accomplishments,
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   she went from one job in a quasi-private regulatory agency, in which she had a seven-figure salary,
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   and now she's gone through the revolving door, into another job with an eight-figure salary,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   and one should not be surprised, or might not be surprised, if she didn't do great things.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   I'm wondering what your view of her tenure was.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   Now this is, who's tenure?
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   Mary Shapiro.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   Well, first of all, I empathized with Mary Shapiro.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   She was trying her best to do the right thing, and the industry ganged up, and so it was
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   irresponsible and disgraceful.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   Like in Union Station, the SEC is now right next door, they had all these signs saying,
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.400]   you know, down with asset value, floating asset value, money, money, money.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   Basically, arguing with the SEC, and with the people who are walking in and out of the
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   SEC doors every day.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   You know, I don't think we need to stoop to that.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   There's a rational argumentation that we should use, and not a sensationalist orientation.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   But, you know, she was right on money market funds, she was right on a lot of things, and
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   basically ended up getting very, very little done.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   Because this industry mobilizes, I mean, this is a powerful lobbying industry, and I think
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   it should look to its own interests more.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   Obviously, a complete conflict of interest in the fund industry.
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.400]   It's being run, they call it the Investment Company Institute, and it's the Investment
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400]   Managers Institute.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.400]   That's a big difference.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   I don't see any evidence they're looking after the interests of fund shareholders.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.400]   It's run by the managers, and the managers are paying the dues, and the managers have
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400]   their own lobbyists.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.400]   So, I'm not bothered by her accession.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.400]   I should say this, I come to it from a background before she took over the chairmanship of being
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   pretty skeptical of Mary Shapiro.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   And I ended up being kind of a Mary Shapiro booster.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:21.400]   And maybe I'm just a sucker for, you know, someone who's trying to do the right thing
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.400]   and gets it thrown back in their face.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   I know a lot about that subject.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.400]   Well, to shift gears ever so slightly, as simulating as this year is going to be, it
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.400]   won't be quite as interesting as Die Hard 8 was in 2008, which I think was what, two
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   weeks, one week post-Lehman.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   We almost got there, though.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   And so, that's my next question, which is the view from the precipice, which we just
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   stopped short of, and the view over the precipice.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:57.400]   I think the long run down, which was done in the financial system with the most recent
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   growth deal in Washington.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.400]   And what could have happened?
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.400]   Well, you know, those are, I guess I was going to say, questions about my pay grade.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.400]   But let me just give you a couple of reflections.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:19.400]   I begin, which in turn had to be totally true with our idiotic statesman, listen statesman
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   like elected officials.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.400]   And that is, I begin with Churchill's statement that Americans always do the right thing,
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   but only after they've tried everything else.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:37.400]   And we came, I mean, I'm not sure, I didn't get a chance to read the morning papers yet,
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   but we probably came within an hour to get President Obama's signature on that bill,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   an hour of the actual report.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   I think it was done before midnight, pretty much had to be.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   Maybe Congress often sets the clock back, so it makes everything that's illegal, legal.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:23:02.400]   But it's, to me, incredible how people can get so dug in with their own personal agenda
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   that they can fail to see what is obviously good for the nation.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.400]   And they can fail to see, I mean, I don't want to get into too much politics here,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   but I might have mentioned this word before, but the president cannot be held hostage,
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   cannot have hostages held and said you do this if you want to ever see your cousin again
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   or your wife again.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   That's just not the right way to negotiate.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.400]   There's a big difference between negotiating over the right things
[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.400]   and negotiating in a hostage situation.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   And it's just about every government and every corporation has found out
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.400]   you just can't finally negotiate with people who are holding hostages.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.400]   There's no final way to win, so you just say do what you will
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   and then get as many bodies in there, FBI, whatever it might be,
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:51.400]   to try and undo the situation by intervention of some kind.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.400]   And it's a risky thing to do.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   So that's what we're going to see, I guess, in Captain Phillips.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   I haven't seen that yet, but those kind of hostage-taking things are not the right way to do it.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   So it's time for negotiation and time not.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   And what I have been amazed at, honestly, Bill, is true to my trying to keep against all odds
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   a balanced viewpoint about the political system.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   I read the Wall Street Journal as well as the New York Times,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.400]   and the Journal has been so much more scathing than the New York Times
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   about how the Republicans, basically the Journal's constituency,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   got themselves into such a loser's game, a mess,
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   that it's really tough on the Republican Party.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   Everybody knows that they finally give up because they're losing in the court of public opinion.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   But that brings up the worst point that affects our, I think, single worst thing that affects our political system,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   and that is these safe boroughs, we used to call them rotten boroughs in England, like Bigville,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.400]   in the old days, the long old days, but these safe seats that, you know,
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   the more strident, the less reasonable you are, the more likely you are to be re-elected.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   And if you're even a moderately conservative person,
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   you're probably going to be confronted in the next primary with someone who's just off the wall,
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.400]   on the right side of things.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.400]   There doesn't seem to be a contravening force on the left.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   Although I think the Journal would say that the labor unions are such a force.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.400]   I'm not sure they have that much power, but there we are, we just own them that way.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   So that's a real problem, to have these basically locked in seats,
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   that care, that are so safe, that they may be around for a long time.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   I read this data the other day, and I'm not sure I'm going to get it right,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   but as everybody knows, the House of Representatives is around number 60-40 Republican.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   But the votes cast for the House of Representatives are roughly 60-40 in favor of Democrats.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.400]   Think about that.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   So when these people say, "We're representing the people,"
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   they're representing this minority of people, and not the majority of people.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   I'm reminded, if I can give you one more of the better quotes of the day, not a current one,
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   but a quote that will indicate that Benjamin Franklin was not without some wisdom about the long term.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.400]   He came out of the Constitution Convention in Independence Hall down here.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.400]   When the deal had been signed, the Constitution had been approved by the Constitutional Convention,
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   going out to the states, and a woman comes up to him and says,
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   "What have you given us, Dr. Franklin?"
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   And he said, "We have given you a republic, if you can keep it."
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   And I think we are endangering that, and I think that's a very, very serious, if totally unquantifiable risk.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:48.400]   But, to get to the second question, Jack, which is, what do you think could have happened,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   and what would have happened, do you really think, had we fallen from our treasuries?
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   I think it would have resulted in such financial chaos all over the world,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   that we would have thrown ourselves into not a depression, a very deep recession.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   And there's no way to know that, thank God there's no way to know it.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   But, when you think about the dollar being the international world currency,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   basically the currency of the world right here, that would go under those circumstances, I think.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   But to think about this powerful nation, the most powerful, except from a financial standpoint, nation on earth,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.400]   not able to pay, or not willing to pay its interest, and that gets to the interest on its debt,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.400]   and that gets to the idiocy, the utter idiocy of a debt limit.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   Because a debt limit is basically a way of saying, we're going to spend X,
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   and we're not going to charge any taxes for it, and if you end up, so you're going to borrow money,
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   but we're going to tell you how much you can borrow with the mathematics of that equation,
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   or establish the moment you undertake the expenditure.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   You've got to pay for it, it may be difficult to do, you've got to hire taxes,
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   you've got to get rid of tax loopholes, whatever you want to say.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   And that gets me to another of my favorite, I don't know if I should be talking politics here, I know I shouldn't,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   but the idiocy, the arrogance, the disgrace of these hedge funds getting capital gains taxes,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   100% of fees, is just so moronic, and so unfair, and it's just, I call it a national disgrace.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Why should that be? Why should the people that have more than anybody else in America pay lower taxes?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   And that's because Senator Schumer, who happens to be a director, is head of the Senate Finance Committee,
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:43.400]   and he's not going to let it happen. His constituency, down there in Wall Street mostly, is not going to let it happen.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:48.400]   And of all the simple reforms, and the only argument I've ever heard against it is it would affect some other things,
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   I don't know how that would be, and the other one would be, it doesn't raise a lot of money.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   Well damn it, if it's wrong, it's wrong. If it raises five cents, or even to do it right, loses five cents, I couldn't care less.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.400]   But there is such a thing as moral absolutism, and there is such a thing as right and wrong.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:15.400]   And sometimes they're very difficult to see, and sometimes I think I see it a little more clearly than the fact is, I'll admit that.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   But, you know, we've just got to have more of a thought about what's good for this great nation,
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.400]   and what's going to keep us from getting in even more trouble than we're having now.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   I was intrigued by the identification of the big fund companies.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   BlackRock, Vanguard, as saying systemically important financial institutions, CIPIs.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   And, you know, I can see how AIG and Lehman did stupid stuff, and got themselves and the financial system into trouble.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   What kind of stupid stuff could Vanguard, Fidelity, and BlackRock do to get the financial system into trouble?
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   Well, usually trouble comes, everybody knows, from leverage.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   You know, you've got obligations you can't meet, and interest payments due on the money you've borrowed.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   And that's what banking is all about, of course, finally.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   And you don't have those kind of issues in sci-fi. What do you call sci-fi? SIPI. Sci-fi sounds better, science fiction.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   And you don't have the borrowing issue.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   But I do think that we are, in fact, systematically important financial institutions.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.400]   The concentration in this business has gotten bigger.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.400]   It's gotten more narrow.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   That is to say, my firm's acquired, I must have mentioned this before, half of all the mutual fund assets.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   And I don't think that's a particularly healthy thing.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   But I can't put my finger on precisely what's wrong.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   But the things I would look first to is, supposing there is a run of redemptions.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   What you're going to say, or somebody, not you, Bill, I'm going to say, well, you know, if you get too many redemptions,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   there'll be a lot of sales, and the market will, you know, find its intersection.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   And it'll go down, and then the black will come in, and that's just life in the marketplace.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   And in some of these scares we've had in the last few years, that short-term malfunction in the marketplace,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   you know, door and well are going to be corrected pretty quickly, you know, maybe in a day.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   And investors care about that, but only very foolish investors care about that.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   You know, it's going to be all come out in the relationship of price to value, and whether there's a bubble or not.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   So, you know, it's not easy to say what the consequences of it are.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   Even as I say, absolutely, you know, if these five firms control, let me say, 20% of all the stock in America,
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   and if you had another 10 firms, it's probably 50%, 10 firms controlling 50% of the stock in America.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   There's something you ought to be concerned about.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   The fact that you don't particularly know what you should be concerned about doesn't mean you should raise a little alarm to me.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   And alert everybody, await the ICI's compassionate response, stay out of our business.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:25.400]   And I do particularly worry about, on the municipal bond side, and particularly for Vanguard,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   because we're the dominant force in the immunity market.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   Everybody knows it's not particularly liquid, and I might talk a little bit about this earlier.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   So, you know, maybe some kind of an idea of having a reasonable amount of reserves to meet demand,
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   to meet redemptions in that business would be a good idea.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   I hope we still do, but I don't know.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   And if the concentration grows, and there's no signs of it growing, you know, at some point, it's just too much concentration.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   But we never know how much is too much.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   I mean, it's, you know, like, write down a number, and I don't think that does it.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   I think what captures it is basically a little bit like corporate America, a concentration of economic power.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   And we're systematically important, because we can tell any corporation in America,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   the mutual fund industry can, what we want them to do.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   We can tell them how much to pay their CEOs, we can tell them anything we wish to.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   And we don't do any of that, that's a whole other issue.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.400]   But that means you're systematically important.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   It doesn't mean there's any terrible risk coming with it, although I think there is the liquidity idea of risk.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.400]   And that's all I can honestly come up with to think about something nearby.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   But I'm glad to have the government look at it that way.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   It's 31 pages long.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   I've read it, because I read that kind of stuff.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.400]   And I didn't see anything to really worry, but they have the same kind of numbers that I'm doing every day,
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.400]   the concentration of oil, oil resources, and things like that.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.400]   And it's a pretty good report, they don't come out with any conclusions.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   But I think the idea that we are systematically important basically has to be tautologically correct.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   You know, if you own, as mutual funds do, about 32% of all the stock in America.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.400]   And that in itself, not to get you into this any deeper than you want to be,
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.400]   but it's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   Because when you look at these 25 largest mutual fund firms,
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   every single one of them also has a pension management affiliate.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   When you take the two of them together, their pension funds and their mutual funds,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.400]   they own, I think it's 55% of all the stock in America.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.400]   These are powerful institutions.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   And the fact they aren't exercising that power is either A, a national disgrace,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.400]   or B, a national asset.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   And you'll have to tell me which is which.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   Okay, well, I think what I'll next do, and perhaps close it up,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   at least in terms of the formal fires out of Chad here,
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   is, unless Chad has questions for me, which is,
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   end with a personal finance question.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   Which is, I don't know if Wade Fowl is in the audience?
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   If he is, raise your hand.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   Wade.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   There you go, hey, Wade.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   You haven't presented your paper yet, have you?
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   Okay, great.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   Well, Wade has done a very important piece of work,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   which bears on the glide path of asset allocation throughout age,
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   or at least in retirement.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   Correct me if I'm wrong, Wade, but, you know, the rule of 100 serves pretty well.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   I think it's a pretty good rule.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   Starting point.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   Yeah, pretty good starting point.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   And Wade has come up with something different.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   It's a very fine analysis that shows that if you start retirement
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.400]   with a given allocation, you're actually better off if you raise that allocation
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   throughout retirement as you get older.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   And I think, you know, he's done an excellent analysis.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   I think he's right.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   And I can even come up with some narrative stories that explain why he's right.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   But I'm wondering what you think of that idea.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.400]   In other words, you should really be 80% or 90% stuck.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   [laughter]
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.400]   As Bob Dole would say, "Whatever."
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   [laughter]
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   There's one thing about mathematical analysis,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   which depends on a whole lot of hypotheses about future returns will be,
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   all of which are uncertain.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   Even the great Vogels, that's in quotes, are uncertain.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   And you want to really be careful of extending, you know,
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.400]   your ideas into somebody's actual living platform.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   You do not want to ignore the behavioral problem.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.400]   You would like to ignore it.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   You should ignore it.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Investors should ignore it.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.400]   But you're building kind of a world there where you're asking for the impossible.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   So I'm going to be interested in hearing Wade's thing.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   But before we end this, you know, I hope I can just push Bill a little bit.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   If he's up to it after getting out of the hospital, oh, my God, what a miracle.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   [laughter]
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   You're making me look bad, man.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.400]   [laughter]
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   But talk a little bit about your three books, your three chapters on the investor.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   Okay, well, for those of you who haven't yet bought all three of my e-books,
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   [laughter]
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.400]   I have a series which is called "Investing for Adults."
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   What I say by adults, I mean people who know all the things that just about everybody
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   or everybody in this audience knows about active management,
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.400]   about there's no stock-picking theory, there's no market-timing theory,
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.400]   there's no risk theory.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   And so the first book, who looked at life cycle investing,
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.400]   was somewhat congruent, actually, with the paper that Wade did as well.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   In fact, Wade helped me with it.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.400]   And it just looks at life cycle throughout age,
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   and it takes a somewhat different point of view from the rule of 100.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   I say it's a good place to start.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   But at the end of the day, I default back.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   The retirement really isn't two-bucket territory.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   It's nice to have one bucket and think of one portfolio throughout most of your life.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   But when your human capital runs out or is about to run out,
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.400]   what really matters to you most is your liability-matching portfolio.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   That is, the portfolio you need, the money you need,
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.400]   in addition to whatever pensions and Social Security you've got,
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.400]   to make sure that you're not diving the dumpster, all right?
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   And maybe have a living standard which is closer to what you might be.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   And beyond that, you can invest in very, very risky assets.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   Well, if you think about what happens as your retirement progresses,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.400]   you start out age, if you're a go-go head, 48.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   [laughter]
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   And you have no human capital left
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   because you're bouncing your grandkids on your knee.
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.400]   You're spending all your time in Florence.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   And so you have this liability-matching portfolio
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   that's pretty large that you need.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   You probably don't have a lot of money left over from that, okay?
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   Well, that's a low stock allocation.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   That's a high-bond stock allocation.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   Well, as you get advanced slowly into geezerhood,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   what happens is that you need less and less of a liability-matching portfolio.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   And if you're reasonably disciplined and you're a go-go head,
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:27.400]   your risk portfolio gets larger, okay?
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.400]   Now, unfortunately, in the United States,
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   most people don't get anywhere near having a liability-matching portfolio.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.400]   But then again, this is an alternative universe in this room.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.400]   So we're not really talking about that.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   The second book really wasn't aimed at this audience.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   It was a book called Skating Where the Puck Was,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   and it's about alternatives.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.400]   And basically, alternatives weren't a bad idea 20 to 10 years ago.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.400]   Most ones actually did have positive alpha 15 to 10 years ago.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   They don't anymore.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   And that's simply because David Swensen went through the head of the buffet table,
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   and he got the sirloin and the lobster tail,
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   and the guys who came through behind him got the chopped hamburger.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   And unfortunately, David Swensen then went and tried to go through the line a second time,
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   and he got mac and cheese from 2007 until 2012.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400]   And that's what that book is about.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   It's why alternatives in the modern era, that is, you know, the past five or ten years,
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   are simply a terrible idea because there's far too many people chasing far too many alternatives,
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.400]   including one that might be important to discuss in this audience, and that's commodities.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   I have two words about commodities, which is "stay away."
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   Or at least commodities futures funds.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   I'm more sympathetic towards commodities producers.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   The third book was a book called "Deep Risk."
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   And "Deep Risk" is about the two different kinds of risk, which you can--
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   and I don't mean to denigrate shallow risk.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   Shallow risk is, you know, temporary stock market falls,
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.400]   which can be a very high magnitude, but eventually are fairly quickly recovered.
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   And I don't mean to denigrate shallow risk,
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.400]   because if you are someone with very little or no human capital, then shallow risk is really important.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.400]   And in fact, you shouldn't even be concerned about deep risk at all.
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   But if you're 23 years old and you have no investment capital,
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   and you have a large amount of human capital left,
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   then you should be very concerned with deep risk.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.400]   And what are the deep risks?
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.400]   Well, I list them there.
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   Inflation, deflation, confiscation, and devastation.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.400]   All right?
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   And inflation is the single most important one.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   And if you look at the long-term returns of stocks and bonds in multiple countries
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   over the past century, almost a quarter,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.400]   what you find is that inflation is a much bigger risk to bonds than to stocks.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   If you have inflation for a period of 30 or 40 or 50 years, it's a very high magnitude,
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   you can actually have real stock returns, which happen in a number of countries,
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   most particularly Israel and Chile.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.400]   And even the nations that you think of as having awful inflation,
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   like Argentina and Brazil, over 20 and 30 years, at least had zero real returns.
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   You didn't lose real purchasing power.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.400]   I was amazed to find that during the Weimar inflation of the 1920s, the wheelbarrow phase,
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.400]   stocks actually had a positive real return,
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   because they were viewed as a real store of value.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   Bonds, on the other hand, get absolutely hammered.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   You lose all your money in bonds.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   So if you're concerned about deep risk, you really do want to invest in stocks for the long run.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   I don't view deflation and the fiat money era,
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   now that we're off the gold standard, as being a serious issue,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   because it just doesn't exist anymore.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   Japan really hasn't had--people talk about Japan having deflation.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   During the past 10 or 12 years, I think they've had 2% total deflation.
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   Ireland and Hong Kong had, I think, double digits for a relatively short period of time.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   That's it. Three countries out of 200 and some odd countries in the world.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.400]   But it really had deflation.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.400]   Confiscation, you can move abroad with that.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   You can play Gérard Depardieu and become a Russian citizen.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   When you talk about devastation in this day and age,
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   you can buy an interstellar spacecraft.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.400]   So that's what the book is really about,
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   is how you think about portfolio management in terms of those risks.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   One thing I like about what Bill has done, and I thought the same thing about Peter Bernstein,
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   is I am looking at myself in a kind of Jonas man, kind of a one-trick pony.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   But Peter Bernstein, to a much greater extent, Bill, has such a range of interests.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   And I love it when investment people, even self-trained investment people,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.400]   have a lot of other interests.
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:21.400]   And he's written these books about the history of the world of plenty, it's called,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   something close to that, The Birth of Plenty.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   And then his newest one is about communications, is that a fair way to describe it?
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   Communications technology.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   And communications technology.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.400]   Another is about world trade, called A Splendid Exchange.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.400]   I'm plugging you here, Bill.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.400]   Thank you.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   All available on Amazon.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:53.400]   But it's the broad-gauge view that I think finally is, in a way, a counterpoint to what I do.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   I'm very happy with what I do.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.400]   I'm sure it's right because it's a simple man.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   But if you're going to go beyond that, listen to someone like Bill,
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   who has such a broad range of experience and such a, not to embarrass him,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   but such intellectual brilliance.
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   And it's a little bit like Paul Sagas, and I'll put you in his camp.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.400]   And that is, I love to be associated with people who are hell-bound smarter than I am.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   It's amazing how much you can learn if you just take a minute to think.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Take a minute to think of ideas in particular that are not those that you hold dear,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.400]   but maybe even counter-opposing ideas.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   And one of the issues, and I hope that Bill can have a minute to comment on this,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   is when you get to asset allocation.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   It seems to me quite apparent, I don't know how to do it,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   but it's quite apparent the way you look at asset allocation depends on the relationship,
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   oversimplified statement, but it'll make the point,
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   on the relationship between bond yields and stock yields.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   And back in the Paul Volcker era, the 10-year treasury was 16%, or at least 15%,
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   and it got down to 1.5%.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   So what rule might have applied when you had that kind of an option to protect your money
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   in the early 1970s, when bond yields were so generous,
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   and they were generous for years and years, and that's why we have a bull market in bonds,
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.400]   with the returns going down as interest rates go down.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   The returns were good for those that held it,
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   and probably when you get back into the treasury, just by a principle-only treasury bond,
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   there could have been no better investment than the U.S. Treasury.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   Nobody saw it at the time, but that's, I think, because they couldn't do the math,
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.400]   and I'm afraid even I didn't think about it enough at the time.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   But my question, I guess, Bill, is what do you think about, conceptually,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   the idea of taking into account, when you're talking about safety in bonds,
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   and growth in stocks, if you will,
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   about taking into account the yield differential that exists,
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.400]   sometimes greatly in favor of bonds,
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   sometimes kind of today I would call it more or less neutral,
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   maybe a little bit better in bonds, but not much,
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   about taking that into account conceptually?
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.400]   And then the much more difficult question is,
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   when you come to grips with it conceptually,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   assuming you think there's some reason to it,
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   how the hell do you implement it, and when?
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   Well, that's a very interesting question, Jack.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   I'll tell another story out of school here.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   First of all, the first part, that was a little older-dash.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   When people ask me, usually it's people who aren't from New York asking me,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   because my last name is Bernstein, I was related to Peter,
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   and I always say two things, number one is I wish,
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:57.400]   and number two is he's who I want to be when I grow up.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:03.400]   But I learned at the feet of a master, Jack.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   You taught me the three-step for estimating stock returns
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   and comparing them to bond returns, and of course it matters.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   And now I'll tell my out-of-school story,
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   which is I had dinner with you some years ago,
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   but not too far from 2000.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   And I waited until you had drank, I think it was your dry martini,
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.400]   before I asked you this question.
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   And I finished my beer, because I needed to screw up my courage,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   and I said, well, Jack, tips are now yielding 4%,
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   and stocks look like they're priced to yield a real return of 2%.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   This was in the day when yields were 1% back in the early 2000s or late 1990s.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   And I said, doesn't that impact your asset allocation just a little bit?
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   And you said, yeah, I'll probably own 5% less stocks.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   And of course, not too long after that, Jack,
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   I think I went to my first boogleheads, and he flips up a slide,
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   and he projected negative nominal returns for the next 10 years for stocks,
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   and everybody guessed, because you brought in mean reversion,
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:25.400]   which was something that I wasn't even willing to think about.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.400]   - Mean reversion of the P/E.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.400]   - Yes, mean reversion of the P/E.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   So what's it look like in 2013?
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.400]   Well, you can do the math as well as I can.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   Stocks--excuse me--bonds have a zero return pretty much,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   certainly a zero real return.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   Stocks are priced to yield a positive 3.5% return, real return, real return.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.400]   So all right, maybe you should own more stocks now.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   But then what happens, Jack, if we get mean reversion of P/Es?
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   - Well, that gets to--and I talked a little bit about this maybe before you got here--
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   about where the P/E is today.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   And there are so many ways of calculating, and I went through that earlier,
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   and I won't take you through it again.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   But I'd say they are within the bounds of reason in terms of the future.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   I don't think--I mean, the P/Es go from--
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   I mean, I'm using a range of--I think it's 20 for the reported earnings,
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.400]   past reported earnings, and about 15 for the future earnings,
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   the so-called accounting-only operating earnings, the lower earnings, the higher earnings figure.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   And so let's just use 17 just for the element.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.400]   You've got to start somewhere.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   And, you know, if you went to 20,
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:45.400]   that would have very little impact on your return to P/E of 20 from there.
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.400]   And if you went from 15, that would have very little positive impact.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.400]   And not enough--since they're all guesses,
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   I'd say not enough to change your course of action.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   So I don't see a lot of mean reversion there, although that's the reality.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   And I think I might have it--do I have this in John Wasik's book?
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.400]   Michael, your version of P/Es.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   It will--I think it's in--I think I put it in the former I wrote to John's book.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   And that is what we know about past experience, which is not--without utility here,
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   is that if a P/E is over 20, the odds are about 85% that it will go down in the next 10 years,
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   by the end of the next 10 years.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   And if the P/Es are under 12, the odds are also about 85% it will go up in the next 10 years.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.400]   So you have a little bit of that going for you.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:37.400]   A little bit of knowledge about some kind of reversion that's more likely to take place than not.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   Not mathematical purity or precision at all.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.400]   But when you get through it all, you know, the dividend yield is pretty precise
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   and it's highly unlikely to be cut again for a long time, but it could be, of course.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   Earnings growth is going to have something to do with the GDP.
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   Earnings growth is slower, as everybody should know.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.400]   But there should be earnings growth of some dimension.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.400]   And the one thing I'd be interested in what you think about this bill is
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:11.400]   I assiduously calculate nominal stock returns and then take out an estimated inflation number.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   So there are two discrete numbers that lead to the real return.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:23.400]   I'm very uncomfortable with numbers that don't have that kind of a split
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   where they build CPI into maybe earnings growth, from nominal earnings growth to real earnings growth.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.400]   First, I'm not sure where it all should come out of there.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   I'm not sure how to handle that.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   But I like the knowledge that I can make my own inflation adjustment looking ahead
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   and not be wrapped up in somebody else's.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   So I can take each step of this way.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:49.400]   And what I like about it, it's so fragile, I like one of my own ideas.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.400]   But what I like about mine is they're very discrete.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   You cannot argue about the dividend yield.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   You can argue about the earnings growth, but only within limits.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.400]   I mean, I think we all know it's not going to be 15%.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   And we all assume it's not going to be zero.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.400]   So you pick your own number of earnings growth.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:07.400]   That's two-thirds of the equation, a known and a highly likely.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   And the PE, when you get down there, you know the probabilities.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:15.400]   So it takes a lot of the mystery out of stock returns.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   And it focuses on anything less than 10 years.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   Oh, they still ask me.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   Maria Barnaromo still says, how do you feel about today's market?
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.400]   Okay, well, Mel just told me his stomach is really starting to growl.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.400]   [Laughter]
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   So I'll make this snaggy.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   You're right.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.400]   Well, that's great food for thought.
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   People probably want to put some food in their belly.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:37.400]   [Laughter]
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.400]   So I hadn't figured mine was that much.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.400]   Jack, you earlier quoted Ben Franklin.
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.400]   And Ben Franklin has another famous saying that I like to quote.
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   And that's, "A penny saved is a penny earned."
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.400]   So we thought this Ben Franklin bust was appropriate
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   because he saved investors trillions of pennies and billions of dollars.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:59.400]   Please accept this as a reminder of the 2013 Volcanics Conference
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.400]   and a reminder of all the money we've saved investors.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   [Applause]
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   Good God.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   [Laughter]
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.400]   Three hours and 45 minutes with Vogel.
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.400]   And even with the help of Bernstein to bail me out at the end.
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.400]   It was quite remarkable.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   You should know that I've received, I think, four of these.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   A long enough for these things.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.400]   I've got Independence Hall.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.400]   I've got the Love Statue.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   And they all sit right on my mantelpiece in my den.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.400]   And this will go next to them.
[00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.400]   But something's going to have to go off it now.
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   [Laughter]
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:51.400]   I know you said that, but we just thought this was so appropriate.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   Oh, this is perfect.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   This will be the last one.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.400]   Oh, I don't want to hear about the last anymore.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.400]   [Laughter]
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   I don't want to hear about the last hurrah.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   I know you're out of space in your den.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:07.400]   Well, thank you all very much.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   And how you can handle this much provo is beyond my comprehension.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   But you've all been very generous.
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   When my wife says--she doesn't do it anymore--she says, "How's the speech go?"
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   And I say, "Well, I don't really have any idea, but I do know this.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   When I laughed, they laughed.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.400]   When I cried, they cried.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   And when I sat down, they applauded."
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   [Laughter]
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:33.400]   Thank you all very much.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.400]   [Applause]
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.400]   [Applause]
