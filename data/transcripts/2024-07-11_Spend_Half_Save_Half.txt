[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.360]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.440]   a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills,
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.800]   insight, and encouragement you need
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.320]   to live a rich and meaningful life
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.720]   now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.440]   or less.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.160]   My name is Joshua.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.720]   I'm your host.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.400]   And on today's podcast, we're going
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.560]   to continue our series on intelligent financial goals
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.080]   that you should set.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.840]   Goal number one was very simple.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360]   It was get a job.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.080]   If you don't have a job, that's probably a good indication
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.000]   that you're not doing well financially.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.440]   So your first goal and ambition should be to get a job.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now today, we continue with the basic stuff
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.840]   that makes a huge difference, which
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.240]   is spend less than you make.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880]   The unique thing about today's episode,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.760]   though, is I'm going to give you a specific amount of money
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.520]   that I think you should spend.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.600]   And that is this.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160]   Set a goal to live on half your income.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440]   I want to persuade you to set a personal goal
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.480]   to live on half your income.
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   Now, I need to back up before I defend this fully
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.560]   and give you a little bit of background discussion
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.280]   and background illumination on this topic.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.280]   I quickly concede that my advice to set
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.280]   a goal of living on half your income
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.880]   is not all that common in the world
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.560]   of personal financial advice.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.080]   I also quickly concede that it may not
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.160]   be achievable by all people.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.880]   But I think it's achievable by most people, especially
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   those who are listening to radical personal finance.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.960]   And I think the reason more people haven't set and achieved
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   this goal is because they've never thought to.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.040]   They've never been encouraged to.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.240]   That was my story.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.360]   And to this day, if I could go back to my youth
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.800]   and change any one thing in my financial life,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.240]   it would have been to always have this goal
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.600]   at the top of my list and to structure
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.400]   all of my life around this practice.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.040]   I could have done it.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.920]   I just didn't do it because no one suggested it to me.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   If you go out in the world today and you ask most people
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.080]   whether you should spend less than you make,
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.120]   most people will agree that you should.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   And certainly anyone who has any experience with money
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.960]   or wealth will say that you absolutely should.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.560]   You must always spend less than you make
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   if you're going to have money.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.400]   If you're going to spend more than you make,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.440]   then you will always have debt and all of the slavery
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.520]   that ensues with being in debt.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.680]   So you should have a focus and a target and a requirement
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.080]   that you're always going to spend less than you make.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.600]   But if you ask people how much you should save,
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360]   the most common answer you will hear
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.920]   will be something like 10 or 15%.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.360]   Now, there are other complicated formulas,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.440]   but I think this is fairly common.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   What I find interesting about this, though,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.600]   is I consider this a piece of advice
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840]   that simply has not kept up with the times.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.600]   Why do I say that?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.520]   Well, if we go back in history, 50 years, 100 years,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.360]   then you and I would have been living in a society
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.200]   in which money was not nearly as available as it is today.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   You and I would have been living in a world
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.920]   in which food cost us a lot more than it does today.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.200]   Housing cost us a lot more than it does today.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.080]   You can still find the reality of this all around the world
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.000]   if you go to poorer countries and poorer economies.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   It would be very normal today to go and look
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   at a low-income household in many regions of the world
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.240]   and find that in a low-income household,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.840]   a worker may spend 50 or 60% of his total income on food.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.400]   Just to survive every day,
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   a worker may have to spend 50% of his income on food.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.160]   But in the countries where you and I are from,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.760]   it would be almost inconceivable for really anybody
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.040]   who's paying any kind of attention
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.840]   to spend more than 20% of income on food.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.800]   If somebody is even spending 20% or more of his income on food,
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.200]   it's exclusively because he's hiring servants to cook for him
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   rather than cooking for himself, i.e. going out to eat.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.320]   The actual bare cost of groceries, the raw ingredients to eat,
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.520]   it's very difficult to imagine, even at the lowest income levels,
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.880]   somebody spending more than 20% on food.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.280]   So go back to the math of how much of your income
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   you should be spending versus saving.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.280]   If you're in a living situation in which you're just buying groceries,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.120]   you're never paying servants to cook for you
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.480]   and to clean up your dishes for you,
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   you're just buying groceries,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.560]   and it's still taking 50 or more percent of your income,
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.640]   and you still have to pay for a roof over your head
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.600]   and everything else needed on a daily basis,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   then if you could save 10% of your income,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.520]   you'd be doing really, really well,
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.160]   which is why historically this has been a basic targeted goal for most people,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.080]   save 10% of your income.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.400]   If you can save 10% of your income, things can work.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.120]   Here at Radical Personal Finance, months ago,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.200]   I released the whole recording of my favorite finance book,
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.040]   which is Richest Man in Babylon,
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   and the cornerstone habit to build in Richest Man in Babylon
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.360]   is to save 10% of your income for yourself,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.360]   and that works, and that's fine.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.360]   But that advice is not even trying if you're saving 10%.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.400]   And so what happens is people will generally achieve the goals that you give them.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.960]   That's what this whole series is based around.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   So when I was 18 years old and I decided I would start saving money,
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.680]   then I thought I should save 10% of my income.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.520]   So I started saving 10% of my income,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.000]   but then I wasted the rest of my money.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.600]   And if somebody had pointed out to me how if I'd saved 50% of my income,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.920]   I could have been so much better off, I would have done that.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.240]   Now, there is no specific number that I can say is the absolute number.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.280]   Some people set a goal of saving 10% of their income, great.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.040]   Some people set a goal of saving 90% of their income and living on 10%, great.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.440]   You can choose the goal that you think makes sense.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.280]   But I think living on half and saving half is a really good round goal,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.760]   spend half, save half, clicks in the brain.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.720]   And it feels like a good balance.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.200]   So let's assume that you set this as a goal.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.400]   What would happen for you?
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.160]   Well, first and foremost, you will always have money.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.880]   You will always have money.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.920]   You'll never be broke.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.760]   If you're living on half your income, you're spending half your income,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.040]   and you're saving half your income, you're always going to have money.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.360]   You're always going to have freedom.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   For every week you work and have a paycheck, you bought yourself a week off.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   For every month you work, you bought yourself a month off.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.880]   For every year you work, you bought yourself a year off.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.680]   Because the ratio is significant, your savings will accumulate very quickly.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.440]   In addition, you'll be enormously flexible.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.240]   You'll have so much room in your budget that you're never going to be stressed about money.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   I'm trying to create this series to be widely applicable.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.920]   I'm going to talk and make some comments that are most applicable to the very young
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.760]   or to people who are just getting started.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   But many things are going to be very applicable to those who are older and more established.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.600]   Even if you are older, have a much higher income, and are much more established,
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.520]   I think you should still set a goal to spend half, save half.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.240]   And this flexibility is enormously important.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.480]   When somebody comes to me for financial planning, and he lives on half of his income,
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:42.400]   then we have so much flexibility around his life decisions that it's not hard to find a plan
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.880]   forward.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.520]   It's not that hard to say, "Hey, why don't you cut your hours back at work so you can
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.320]   go and get the degree to move into the career that you really want."
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.000]   It's not that hard to say, "Yeah, let's go ahead and plan in a sabbatical."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.360]   It's not that hard to say, "Hey, you're going to be so on track for retirement.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.720]   Why don't you do this for another three or four years and then take five or ten years off?"
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.520]   Or, "Yes, you'll be on track for early retirement at age 50."
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.040]   It's all based upon the flexibility that we get by spend half, save half.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.840]   However, when somebody comes who is middle-aged, has a normal middle-aged income,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   and is spending 90% of his income, one little disruption can make the difference.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.760]   One little pay decrease due to a pandemic.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.080]   One little job loss.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.840]   Everything is too close to the edge.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.960]   And so that flexibility is really, really important.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.320]   You want to make sure that you maintain flexibility.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.080]   And living on half your income will always keep your flexibility.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   You'll always have money to make the big investments that will get you quickly to
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   where you want to go.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.400]   So in this series, I'll rehash for the umpteenth time some of those big decisions.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.880]   But in life, what usually happens is on an annual basis,
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.800]   there are kind of basic marginal increases that are available.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.000]   So for example, "Yeah, okay, I got a cost of living raise.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.760]   I got a small increase at work.
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.520]   I got a slight promotion."
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.320]   And those things are important and you should take advantage of them.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.800]   However, the big wins usually come from noticing an opportunity when it comes your way,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   and then taking it.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.480]   You notice that there's an industry that's growing.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   And if you just go and become trained as a geology engineer or whatever the current thing is,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.720]   then you'll be on track for a great new opportunity.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.320]   And so you go and you take it.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.240]   And three years from now, you've doubled your income.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.840]   But in order to do that, you needed to be able to go and be a professional student again,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.680]   and cover yourself while going through class.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.160]   You needed to go and be able to put yourself in a situation to pay tuition payments.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.760]   Or you find out about a new industry and a new opportunity,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.040]   but it's on the other side of the country.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   So you need to quickly move to the other side of the country to take the job.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.000]   Or so-and-so says, "You should start this great new franchise that I heard about it.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.720]   But the franchise fee is $100,000.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.880]   So you have to come up with $100,000 to pay the franchise fee to start the new business."
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.160]   If you say yes to those opportunities when they come along,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.280]   then very commonly a few years later, everything is working beautifully for you.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.320]   But you have to have a little flexibility and a little bit of money to say yes.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.120]   And the guy who saves 10% of his income usually never gets that breakout velocity.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.320]   He never has enough money to say yes to those opportunities.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:35.200]   He's already committed 90% of his pay towards living, towards his expenses.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.760]   Another big benefit of doing this is you're going to develop frugality muscles.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.880]   I think frugal muscles are worth developing.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:48.560]   Whether or not you exercise them at every occasion is up to you
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.600]   and your long-term ambitions and goals.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.240]   But knowing that you have those frugal muscles
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.160]   and that you can exercise them is enormously empowering.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:06.080]   People who don't have frugality muscles are weak and flabby and not worthy of your admiration.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.120]   Anybody can make $200,000 a year and spend $200,000 a year.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.280]   It's not hard to live that way.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   But the guy who knows he can live on $25,000 a year and still make it
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.760]   is a much stronger, more resilient person.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.880]   In tradition, there have been many cultures that have appreciated this.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.680]   By the way, I have to correct myself.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.600]   Not anybody can make $200,000.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.320]   What I'm saying is that people who constantly search for ease and comfort,
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.720]   these are not attributes that you should look for.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.240]   There are many historical cultures in which people who were fat and flabby
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.720]   and just always needed to sleep on something that was soft
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   and sit in a comfortable, soft chair,
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:53.360]   they were scorned because of their lack of resilience, their lack of hardness.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.680]   And so I think we can take that over metaphorically into the world of frugality
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.200]   and say that this should be a common thing.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.960]   I enjoy staying at five-star hotels.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.160]   I really do.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   Luxury is fun.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.880]   Luxury is great.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.160]   It's really nice.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.320]   But I don't ever want to lose my ability to sleep on the ground and not complain the next day.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.240]   That's a really important feature to have.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:26.160]   It's my ambition to be perfectly comfortable in a tuxedo at a five-star hotel and a fancy soiree.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.360]   I also want to be perfectly comfortable in a roach-filled motel room on the bad side of town
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.360]   because that makes me a more capable human being.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.720]   I myself don't admire people.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.560]   "Oh, life has to be in this perfectly comfortable space for me.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.080]   I just can't do it."
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.720]   Now, when you have money, it's fine to spend it, obviously.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.160]   Most of us don't want to go through life living the same way we used to.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.320]   But you should have the confidence and the satisfaction of knowing, "I can do that."
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.160]   So if you begin this habit when you're young,
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.480]   let's say you're earning just a very little amount of money
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.680]   and you are building the frugal muscles of living on 50%,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   that's going to put within you an enormous level of confidence
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.560]   because I know how to spend absolutely nothing if I have to.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.960]   And now, when you think about risk in the future, it won't bother you very much.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.920]   One of the things that I've observed in coaching people
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.160]   is sometimes people will hire me and they'll say, "Joshua, listen,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.880]   I booked a consultation with you because I'm thinking about starting a business."
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.320]   Or, "I have this big risk in my life and do you think I should do it?
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.280]   What do you think I should do?"
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.200]   And in many cases, a guy might be sitting on tons of money,
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.320]   but the reason he doesn't have the—and by tons of money,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.560]   I mean tens of thousands of dollars in savings,
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.520]   sometimes six figures or multi-six figures in savings.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.200]   But what happens is he's scared of, "What if this doesn't work?
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.840]   And what if I have to live on less than $100,000 a year?"
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.920]   And so he waits, and he waits, and he waits, and he waits, and he's not sure.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.040]   So if you have frugal muscles and you know,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.520]   "Hey, I don't want to live on $30,000 a year.
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.920]   That's not my idea of a good time. I really prefer my $90,000 a year lifestyle.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.080]   But I've been there before. I've done it before.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.160]   I know I could do it and it wouldn't be the end of the world.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.480]   And in fact, I can do it and be just fine."
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   Then you have a level of confidence and you can move through life more aggressively.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.600]   You can say yes to more options more aggressively.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.360]   It's difficult to earn lots of money and to earn lots of money quickly.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.520]   It takes a lot of work and a little bit of luck.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.720]   It's difficult to accumulate lots and lots of money.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.600]   But you can develop frugal muscles really quickly.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.400]   And in six months, 12 months, 24 months, be really good at living inexpensively.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.880]   People do this all the time when they have to.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.600]   Guy goes through a divorce and he finds out, "You know what?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.960]   If I move into this box truck that I bought that was an old U-Haul truck,
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   and I set up my house in there, and I shop where I can get the day-old bread,
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.400]   and I figure out a source of cheap meat and eggs and milk and pig butts to live on,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.480]   then I'm in a better place where I can live pretty inexpensively and I can put my life back together."
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.360]   Happens all the time.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.680]   Then all of a sudden, he discovers he's free.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.000]   He discovers he doesn't have to do the job that he hates.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.760]   And if he discovered that 20 years ago, maybe his life would be in a much better situation today.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.320]   So frugal muscles are worth developing and they're worth exercising,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.680]   even if you don't always choose to live like a total cheapskate.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.000]   In addition, one powerful benefit of save half, spend half is
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.320]   you'll keep your focus on increasing your income.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:34.160]   Basically, my goal for you is to be a few years behind your friends in consumption
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.840]   and decades ahead of them in wealth building.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:47.360]   And when you impose deprivation on yourself, you impose limits on yourself that are artificial
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   and arbitrary, such as, "I'm only going to spend 50% of my income."
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.840]   You build your self-discipline, which is a very important skill for long-term success.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.480]   And you recognize, "Hey, if I want out of this, I got a way out of this.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.920]   I just got to increase my income."
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.400]   And so instead of sitting back and luxuriating in kind of the soft,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   flabby fatness of high consumption on a low income, you still have a little fire in your
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.800]   belly because you say, "You know what? I'd like to have some nicer things.
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.960]   And I can have them as soon as possible when I increase my income."
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.440]   And I see this not infrequently.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.000]   Usually, it's a guy who gets out of college, first job out of college.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.080]   Maybe he's making 50 grand a year.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.640]   And previously, he was living like a broke college student.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.720]   And now he can buy all of his little toys and trinkets and things that he wants to do.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.120]   So he loosens his belt and he just starts spending money without worrying too much about it.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.760]   And now he's satisfied all of his desires.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.920]   But what he often doesn't see is what his desires are going to be 10 or 15 years from
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.480]   now.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.040]   And the fact that he's now kind of fat and flabby and satiated with, "I've got all the
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:53.680]   fun stuff.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.080]   Look, I got this cool new TV and I go out to eat all the time and party with my buddies
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.160]   in Spain and ain't this great."
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.560]   Then he's missing out on where he can be a decade or two from now when all of a sudden,
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.840]   the numbers start to increase and everything becomes more important.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.400]   If you can just insert a little bit of forced privation on yourself and you say, "No, I'm
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.280]   just going to spend 50%."
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.680]   And now you have other motivation to increase your income.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.400]   Again, you'll just be a few years behind your friends in consumption, but you'll be
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.560]   decades ahead of them in wealth building.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:31.600]   I'm not laboring on the topic of wealth building in this particular episode, but I do want
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.960]   you to know how big of a difference this makes in the long term.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:43.040]   The chart that changed my entire mindset around financial planning, I've done various
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.840]   podcasts on this, was when I read an early retirement extreme by Jacob Lund Fisker, when
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.520]   I read the chart showing how quickly you can become financially independent based upon
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.960]   different savings rates.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   I'll link to a podcast episode I did exclusively on this in today's show notes.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.440]   But the idea is, where does that 10 or 15% number, that advice that you get usually come
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:05.940]   from?
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.520]   Well, interestingly, if you are investing your money in stocks at about the historical
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:17.920]   rate of return of the stock market, and you're saving 10% of your income, then it'll take
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.840]   you about 45 years for you to be financially independent, able to retire, about 40, 45
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.320]   years, which is conveniently enough the number of years between about age 20-something and
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.880]   about age 60, 65-something, when you get out of college, you get a job, and you start
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.380]   working.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.460]   And then you retire at 65.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.460]   And so the idea of saving 10% makes a lot of sense.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:47.940]   But if you could save 50% of your income, you can be financially independent in fewer
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:54.980]   than 20 years, which conveniently enough puts you well on track for a pretty cool early
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.420]   retirement scenario.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:02.260]   Start working at 22, 25, something like that, with a big job, living on 50% of your income,
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:09.460]   by 45 or 50, you are financially independent, just by living on half your income.

[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.940]   I'm going to give you some how.
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:46.740]   Let's do how first.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.260]   So how do you do this?
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.460]   What are some practical tips?
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.180]   Well, the first thing is just do it.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:59.540]   So if you are, again, 16 years old, and you get your first paycheck, what you do, cash
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:04.980]   the first paycheck, first paycheck is $300, put $150 in one pocket, put $150 in the other
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.660]   pocket, put $150 in the other pocket, and you only spend out of the one pocket.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.940]   Divide that out, put it in a separate bank account, just make a habit that from now on,
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.020]   whenever I get a paycheck, I split it in half.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.300]   If you're signing up for a job, on day one, if you have the option to put multiple accounts,
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:27.140]   figure out what 50% of your income is, and on day one, just sign up for 50% split, and
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.060]   put 50% in a savings account, 15% in a spending account.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.980]   It's that simple.
[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:38.580]   You'll forget about it in just a few weeks or months.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.860]   You just won't ever think about it again.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.300]   It's an automatic habit that you'll set in place.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.020]   If you have a dual income household, then set a goal to live on one income.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:52.340]   Whenever possible, when people are getting married, I always encourage them, "Listen,
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:59.220]   you got two incomes, you've been living fine individual, separate, just set a goal just
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.940]   to live on one income and save an entire income."
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.260]   It's a really simple and straightforward way to do it.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:11.060]   If you set it as a goal, you can work towards it systematically, and there are various ways
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.020]   that you can kind of make a change in this direction.
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.500]   The first thing to do is whenever you get an increase, save half, spend half.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.820]   Let's say this year, you get a pay increase.
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:26.420]   Well, take half of your pay increase and put it to savings using some form of automatic
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.900]   contribution to an account, and then put half into your spending budget.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.700]   So at least save half, spend half of your increases.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:40.020]   I always am a big fan of the pie methodology, the idea being you just got to start going
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.300]   in the other direction.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.900]   Let's say right now you're saving 0% of your income.
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:50.100]   Well, all you're going to do is start by going from 0% to 1%, and then set yourself a schedule
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.500]   where every three months or every two months, whatever you think you can do, you're going
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.100]   to go and increase by 1%.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.420]   So you go from 1% to 2%, 2% to 3%, 3%, 4%, on and on.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.740]   If you just do that but you stick to your schedule, within a few years, you're at 30%,
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:12.260]   40%, getting your way up to 50%, and set a goal to get there systematically over time.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:21.060]   A lot of this automatic stuff will help you to get there just based upon your basic spending.
[00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:28.340]   What I mean is you'll get there little by little just by restraining the excess spending
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.100]   that you don't need to make.
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.660]   This doesn't cover all circumstances.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.820]   If you are more established, you have your financial life and everything is set up and
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.780]   structured around a current level of lifestyle, then you have two choices.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:47.540]   You can't get there with just little bits of eating out one time less per month.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.420]   Well, then you need to change something structural.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.740]   You should look at where you live and ask yourself, "Can I change something structural
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.140]   about where I live in order to reduce my housing expenses significantly?"
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.980]   Look at your taxes.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.380]   Can I change something structural about what I'm doing so that I can reduce my tax bill?
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.340]   I'm fine with your 50% going into a retirement account, as we'll talk about in a future option.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.940]   And now, hey, getting there, I saved a bunch of money on taxes.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.620]   Can we go from a three-car family to a one-car family?
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:18.580]   Is that possible?
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.860]   Can we make it on one car and now we can get rid of a car payment?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.380]   Can we change something structural with our situation?
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.940]   And in most cases, if you want to, you can.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:36.980]   Related to this, if you can't do it, set it as an ambition to do it when you can.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.460]   So the biggest lock-in for most people has to do with children.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.300]   So I'm a good example of this.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:49.140]   I'm at a point in my life where the structural expenses of my life are very high and they're
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.660]   difficult to change.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.300]   I have a household for seven people.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.500]   I have five children.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:00.580]   There's a certain kind of house that works best for a family with five children.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.980]   I'm not nearly as flexible as I was 10 years ago when it was just my wife and me.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.780]   That was simple.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.580]   It was pretty easy.
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:07.620]   We could fit in anywhere.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.900]   So children are the biggest impact here.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.740]   So if you're at a point in your life where you're kind of where I'm at, where you're
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.500]   kind of locked in and it's difficult to make big structural changes and there's nothing
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.220]   that's obvious, then create a plan for how I'm going to do this in the future.
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.060]   So today, I might need this big house, but 10 years from now, I might be able to go ahead
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.220]   and move back into the studio apartment.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.580]   Many people don't do this.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:31.860]   Why?
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.460]   Well, because we get used to living in a big house and, okay, that's fine.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.340]   And so they stretch it for an extra 20 years until finally they decide to downsize.
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.020]   Well, why not be more flexible than that?
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.500]   Why not make a plan to downsize a little bit earlier?
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.980]   So much of the time, and to be clear, like, listen, I don't judge you for the decisions
[00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.540]   you make.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:57.540]   My job is to help you figure out what's going to work for you based upon your restrictions.
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:04.420]   But the higher your requirements are, the harder it is to get where you want to go.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.660]   And so when someone comes to me and say, "Listen, Joshua, I've got this big house.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.180]   I don't need it anymore.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:13.780]   My children are grown and gone, but I really have this big house and this fancy lifestyle
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.820]   and all this stuff.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.700]   But I also want to retire early and also want to have financial security."
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.420]   Buddy, something's got to change.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.100]   You got to be the one to change it.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.340]   And so if you can't get there with just little small habit changes, you got to change it
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.860]   with something structural.
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.700]   So plan ahead for that.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.980]   Make a plan and say, "All right.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.380]   At this point in my life, I need the big house, and I'm going to keep it for right now.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:42.740]   And however, I'm going to have a plan where in eight years when two of the children are
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.820]   off at college, then the two other children and I, we're going to move into a smaller
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:50.340]   place so that we can get back and get to this 50% number."
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:54.580]   Then finally, you have the option of changing your income.
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:27:00.420]   And so if you go through and we can't make any changes or we choose not to make any changes
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:07.140]   on expenses, then go back to income and set a goal that as my income increases, we're
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.980]   going to get to the 50% number.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:16.260]   Why is it so common that people 5X their income and don't make much progress on their
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.900]   finances?
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.300]   Well, it's because we can happily spend just about any level of income.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.780]   Your income today is almost certainly 5X what it was when you were 20 years old.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.220]   When you were 25 years old, that's just how life goes.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.100]   But you don't notice it and it just goes up.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.980]   So if you have your expenses, just naturally follow along.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.500]   We can do a little bit more, have a little bit nicer things.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.340]   The goofy example but real example that I observed in my family growing up was our morning
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.700]   orange juice changed.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:51.620]   When I was a young child, we had orange juice every morning and it was always orange juice
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.820]   from concentrate.
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:57.940]   So you got the little tube from the frozen department at Publix and you put it in your
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.220]   pitcher and you mix it up with water and that was what we drank as orange juice.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.980]   It was orange juice from concentrate.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:08.340]   And then as my older sibling started to move out of the house, then we started to have
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.660]   real orange juice, fresh squeezed orange juice, not from concentrate.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.300]   And that was the sign of our increasing wealth.
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.580]   Or another funny one that I certainly remember was maple syrup.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.460]   When I was a boy, my mom always made maple syrup.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:26.740]   She used some corn syrup and maple extract flavoring to make maple syrup to go on pancakes
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.700]   and waffles.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.340]   Then we reached a certain point in time where all of a sudden the real maple syrup started
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:38.660]   showing up on our table and we knew that we were rich now because we changed our orange
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.780]   juice and our maple syrup.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:47.140]   So it just kind of naturally happens is that you spend more and more as the money is available
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.140]   if you don't have a goal.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.580]   So once again, if you right now are saving 15% of your income and you set as a goal to
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:00.500]   get to 50% of your income, as your income increases, just lag your expense growth.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.140]   You may indeed have those high structural expenses.
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.820]   You may have a high mortgage.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.100]   You may have high other things.
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.540]   You may have high car payments.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.460]   When the cars get paid off, just keep them an extra five years.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.020]   Don't trade them in at six years old.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.380]   Keep them until 11 years old and then trade them in.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.900]   And then by that time, you can probably go ahead and get a new car and still keep it
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.260]   50% of your expenses.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.300]   Cover your needs, don't spend all your money.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.780]   There's going to be a base level of needs that everyone has to cover.
[00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:33.780]   And so if you're there, cover your needs, but don't spend all your money.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:39.860]   Set as a goal to get to 50% of your income in terms of savings and spending.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.660]   And even if it takes you 10 years to get there, you'll be grateful for it and you'll start
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.060]   to reap the benefits quickly along the way.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.260]   Remember, we live in a world in which many people spend more than they make.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.980]   So if you're spending less than you make, you're doing well.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.020]   We live in a world in which some people save 10% of their income.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.260]   So celebrate when you get to 22% of your income.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.220]   That's going to be amazing.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.980]   Think how quickly your wealth is growing.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.260]   And when you get to 40% of your income, you're in a very rarefied area, a very rarefied company.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.340]   And your wealth is growing really, really quickly.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.580]   And so you'll have motivation to get there.
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.340]   What if you're in an extreme situation?
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.580]   Your income is extremely low or your income is extremely high.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.740]   Remember, I'm setting goals.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   They may not be achievable by you or they may not be relevant for you.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:32.260]   If your income is extremely low, you're working as a minimum wage worker and you're supporting
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:37.540]   a household with children, you're not going to be able to make it to 50% of your income.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.740]   And that's perfectly fine.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:45.140]   But you still got to live on less than you make and you still got to save something.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.140]   So work towards it and be patient.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:52.420]   I have watched a lot of people make a lot of mistakes because they didn't notice when
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.460]   things changed.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:31:01.700]   In 2024, you may be earning minimum wage, supporting a big family, and things aren't
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.900]   going so well.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.540]   But in 2034, you could be in a completely different situation.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.420]   So don't turn around and just start spending all your money.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.180]   Keep this goal in the back of your mind.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.940]   Keep this goal in the back of your head for when you get there and focus on your income.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:23.060]   If your income is very high, there are many people who spending 50% of their income would
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.460]   be pointless extravagance.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:29.380]   Recognize that there's nothing magic about any of these numbers.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.020]   If you can live on 20% of your income, great.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.620]   Live on 20% of your income.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.180]   Now we got to figure out what to do with the other 80%.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.180]   There's no magic about the number.
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.580]   My goal is to say, "Hey, this is a really good round number.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.380]   This is really doable for many, many people.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.820]   And this dramatically accelerates the wealth-building process and dramatically accelerates the
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.940]   options that are available to you as compared to 10%.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:59.940]   So basically, I'm saying we shouldn't make 10% the default.
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:05.780]   If we're going to make any number the default, let's make it 50%, not 10%.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:12.580]   Let's train our children to expect to spend half their income rather than 90% of their
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.380]   income.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:17.140]   And they'll be really grateful for that 15 or 20 years from now.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.220]   Final comment.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.380]   This is a concept, not a rule.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.660]   So be smart about how you implement it.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:30.740]   Let's say that you're a young man and you're saving 50% of your income and spending 50%
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.460]   of your income.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.220]   And all of a sudden, a chance comes along for you to buy a house.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.580]   Don't get bent out of shape because a house is a consumption expense.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.140]   And after all, is this going to be spending my money?
[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:44.420]   No, buy the house.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.540]   That's why you're saving the money.
[00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.540]   So take 50 grand or whatever you've got in savings by that point in time and buy the
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.020]   house.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:59.300]   What we're basically trying to avoid is getting used to just consuming 90% of your income.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.420]   But along the way, you're going to make big purchases, you're going to make big investments,
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.900]   you're going to make big gambles, take big bets on something.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.060]   And not everything is going to go great.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.660]   Once you experience having some money saved up, you're going to see the options that are
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.020]   available to you.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:23.700]   So the goal is just keeping your expenses, your standard expenses down so that you can
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.060]   make those big things.
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.700]   So don't get all bent out of shape and say, "Well, if I take all this money, I'm going
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.820]   to get out of shape," and say, "Well, if I take all this money from my savings and
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:37.540]   I put it all into this house that's available, then everything's going to fall apart."
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.220]   No, just buy the house.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.020]   It's going to be fine.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.580]   And then final, final comment is if you can't do this, it's okay.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.860]   But you can still teach other people to do it.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:56.820]   I think there are a lot of us who will probably never accomplish all of the things that we
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:01.220]   wish we had accomplished when we were younger.
[00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:05.380]   I've reached that point in my own age in which I feel that very keenly.
[00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:10.420]   There are many life paths and life decisions that are now out of my ability because the
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:11.620]   years keep going along.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:18.580]   So one of the things that I can do is learn from that and then turn around and just try
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.940]   to help other people.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.740]   So you may never be able to get your income high enough and your expenses low enough to
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.820]   be able to live on 50% of your income.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.380]   That's okay.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.380]   That's fine.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:34.820]   Teach your children differently and help them just to look at things differently.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:40.820]   At the end of the day, most of us are going to hit the goals that are given to us.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:49.140]   So let's give other people a really life-changing goal like spend half, save half, live on 50%
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:56.580]   of your income as compared to just modest good advice like save 10%.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.660]   Not everybody is going to achieve any goal.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.060]   Not everybody's going to achieve 10%.
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.500]   Not everybody's going to achieve 50%.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:12.820]   But if we just install the standard goal being to spend half, save half, a decade or two
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:19.460]   from now, you're going to get a whole bunch of big thank yous from those who were inspired
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:25.780]   to go after that goal because they were capable of it rather than achieving a less impactful
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.020]   goal.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.980]   At Cox Mobile, we know you're smart.
