[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   In class you emphasized that we're working with basic laws of physics.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800]   So I just read Einstein's biography.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.960]   He was obsessed with finding a single theory that would unify all the
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.360]   fundamental forces of nature.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.840]   Wow.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.920]   Do you think there exists a unified theory of grappling where you can boil
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.720]   everything down to just a few principles?
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.480]   Well, first off, if Einstein wasn't able to come up with the unified theory, I
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.960]   would sincerely question my ability to go that way.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.440]   But do I believe that something like that could potentially exist?
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.040]   Absolutely.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840]   And I think that even if it doesn't, a belief in the possibility of it and the
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.080]   search for it would leave you better off than where you started.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.200]   Whereas if I was, "Ah, no, no, that's bullshit.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.640]   That would never..."
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.560]   And then I don't look.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.880]   Even if I'm right, because I didn't look, there's certain things I won't learn.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.240]   So I think, you know, a lot of times just, let's say alchemy, the idea that
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.560]   you're going to turn lead to gold.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.760]   All right.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.840]   Well, that's a little bit nuts.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.640]   But who knows, maybe that's that kind of nutty and, you know, highly unlikely,
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.320]   highly unlikely probability of success pursuit yielded scientific progress
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.920]   elsewhere in the search for that.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.720]   Even though, again, someone would look back and say, "Oh, that's stupid.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.960]   Who would do that?"
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.440]   Well, if you spent years trying to figure it out, I guarantee you're going
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.680]   to learn some other things as well.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   So I think that there at the very least, a principle-based approach to
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.040]   grappling is incredibly important.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.840]   So what's your process like for learning new details and understanding the
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.480]   principles behind techniques?
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.800]   I certainly don't believe that I have like a singular or perfect approach by
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.960]   any stretch of the imagination.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.000]   But, you know, I guess what I try to do is block out extraneous nonsense.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280]   Like for instance, a lot of people want to talk about 55 details and reasons for
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.120]   something that's going on.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   And the reality is, is that you're clouding your thought process.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.840]   For instance, there was a recent, not to get too political, but there was a recent
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.360]   issue where I remember an inmate was executed and they used a new drug and it
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.320]   was painful and, oh my God, and he died.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.000]   It was horrible.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.560]   Again, that's whether you believe that capital punishment is valid or not, I
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.360]   think there's plenty of arguments against it.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.600]   In fact, I think most of the arguments that make sense are against it.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.680]   But pain has fuck all to do with it.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.000]   You know, I don't care.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.280]   That's like, "Hey Lex, I'm going to kill you, but don't worry, it's not going to
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.720]   hurt."
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   No, that's okay then.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.520]   It's like, that doesn't make it okay.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.040]   It's like, believe me, I prefer, again, if you're going to kill me, I prefer this.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.200]   You don't burn me at the stake.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.120]   But if someone was like, "Don't worry, it's not even going to sting.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.960]   I'm still going to try to fight you to the death.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800]   I'm absolutely not allowing this to happen."
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640]   If someone wants to say, "Oh, okay, hold on.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.920]   Let's cut the bullshit, like, feely feelings out of here and say, look, forget
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.320]   the pain.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.720]   Does this person deserve it?
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   Ah, well, let's step that back again.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.520]   Is there a potential for human error?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   Is there potential for someone having this guy behind bars for political gain?"
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.200]   Like, okay, these are the real reasons that you say, "Hey, no way on the death
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.600]   penalty."
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.640]   It has nothing to do with, does it hurt?
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   Or which drug is it?
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.800]   Or blah-de-blah.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.720]   Or is it inhumane?
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.320]   It's like, none of that.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.880]   If, hey, we're focusing on the wrong thing.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880]   So it reminds me of jujitsu in the same sense.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.600]   And again, we're fighting, we're generally speaking, in my opinion, debates that
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.840]   happen in the public, you know, arena, they always focus on the wrong dang thing
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.480]   and always focus on the wrong aspect.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.840]   Again, there's 25 good reasons or bad reasons to do almost anything.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   But generally speaking, people will focus on the hundred other ones that are
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.000]   extraneous and retarded.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.800]   So what I want, I guess what I would say is it reminds me of jujitsu or striking.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   Like, oh man, Floyd likes to hold his hand this way or that way or the other way.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.800]   And this guy likes to jab like this.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.680]   And it's really important.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.960]   This person says you land with this knuckle and that person says you land
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.560]   with that knuckle.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.880]   And in jujitsu, it's very, very important that you grip three inches up on the
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.160]   lapel and two to the right.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.360]   But Roger Gracie does it like this, but Cabrini says it like this.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.240]   Clearly they all work under the right circumstances and don't work under the
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.680]   wrong ones.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.360]   And it has nothing to do or very little to do with these other things.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.480]   Like, hey, does it matter?
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   Again, I'm going to kill you.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.840]   Would you prefer for it to be painless or horrifically painful?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.240]   Okay.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.840]   If it's already a foregone conclusion, death.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.360]   All right.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.440]   Now we'll start to talk about the, the extreme, like whether or not it's going
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.000]   to sting, but until we get to that point, Hey, let's focus on the, do we, is it
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.480]   even right?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.360]   Or do I have the ability or the capacity to do this justifiably?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   Okay.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.280]   So that's where you come down to the principles in my opinion and say, all
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.000]   right, yeah.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.640]   Does it matter which knuckle you land with?
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.280]   Yeah, I'm sure it does, but it's a hell of a lot less important than 25 other
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.000]   little things that make all of the difference.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.640]   And in my experience, a lot of coaches and a lot of people, particularly guys
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.720]   that are trying to bullshit you, um, we'll focus on 45 little details and,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.040]   oh, it's there's 15 details to this technique.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.320]   Okay.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.840]   That's true.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.160]   But what are the two most important ones?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.560]   Because, Hey, don't get me wrong.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.920]   I'm not saying that these details don't matter, but just like anything else in
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.560]   life, there's a hierarchy, right?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.080]   Because would you say that, would you say that happiness and self-actualization
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.280]   is a valuable thing in life?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.800]   Yes.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.160]   I would as well.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.880]   And you know what?
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.480]   We have the luxury of saying that type of thing because we're sitting at 50, 50
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.680]   jiu jitsu in Falls Church, Virginia, and there's no one trying to kill us, rape
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.040]   us, and we are also, I know where food is tonight.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.760]   If you were to walk down, if you were to talk to someone like 2000 years ago,
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.000]   I'll be like, how are you feeling?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.160]   They would stare at you like, what are you fucking retarded?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.840]   I'm starving.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.920]   I'm hungry.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.640]   That's my issue.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.760]   Are you, are you satisfied in your life?
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.480]   It's like, I'll be satisfied when you get out of my way so I can find some food.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.320]   So that's even the deeper question is, are you eating something tonight?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.920]   Right.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.840]   And so it's Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.720]   When we take care of the base needs first, then we start to work our way up
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.920]   towards self-actualization and this and that.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.120]   And, but until you've got your food, water, shelter, don't tell me about
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   where you're placing your grip.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.040]   It's like, you're all leaning out and you're, you know, your posture is poor
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.920]   and you're out of balance and you want to tell me your grip, that's like, I'm
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.840]   starving to death.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.680]   The, you know, the barbarians are at the gates, but I'm sitting here
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.120]   giving you a philosophy lesson.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.840]   It's like, this is retarded.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.080]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.080]   Build a better wall, a sharper knife and get some food.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.840]   And then we'll cover all the other stuff.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.440]   So I think that in my, when it comes to how I approach martial arts in terms of
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.360]   learning, as well as teaching, I really try to boil it down to what I feel to be
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.880]   the most important component parts.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   And then if I one day reach the level of where these tiny details matter, that's
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   fantastic because again, the difference between, you know, the ability to pass,
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.360]   let try to pass successfully against a Cabrini or Rafael Mendez and against a
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.000]   regular run of the mill black belt are, you know, it does come down to little
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.240]   details, but it's also presupposing that you're in proper position that even allow
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.600]   these details to become relevant.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.160]   And I think that a lot of times we put the car before the horse and
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.360]   that's not, that's problematic.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.840]   Are there still, in your opinion, undiscovered positions, submissions
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.920]   or techniques in Jiu Jitsu?
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.600]   Oh, I would say that there have to be, there absolutely are.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.760]   Um, you know, I think that what we see is Jiu Jitsu now, don't get me wrong.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.640]   The core never changes because physics doesn't change.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.720]   Physics is the same thing.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.320]   That's why I get a kick out of people that love to like self-defense arguments.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.200]   It's like bullshit.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.160]   It has no, there's no physical difference in self-defense beyond the fact.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.200]   Yes, you can eye gauge me though.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   I've never seen anything like that in real life that you're crossing a pretty
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.280]   serious psychological line.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.680]   If you're putting your knuckles to, you know, your thumb, two knuckles
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.240]   deep into somebody's eye, forget the fact that, you know, that we're legal,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.360]   moral, other things like that.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.320]   It's like, I've never done that before.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.560]   I wouldn't do it lightly.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.920]   There'd probably be some hesitation there.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.240]   What, so anyway, what makes it different is the psychological component and all
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.960]   these other things going on, but physically there's no difference.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.440]   Again, people like, Oh, Jiu Jitsu is really different than MMA.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   No, it's not.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.960]   Not in my opinion, not in my experience.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.920]   It is absolutely not.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.920]   What are you talking about?
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.600]   Physics are different inside of a cage than they are on a mat.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.480]   And they are out in a field.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.280]   It's exactly the same.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.560]   Now, if I try to sport grapple you under a non-sport grappling rule set, then I
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.160]   may run myself into trouble, but that had nothing to do with Jiu Jitsu.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.920]   Jiu Jitsu is physics, is proper expression of physics, the same way boxing is.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.640]   And the same way wrestling is the same way all of these things are.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.600]   So I would say that as long as something adheres to the principles that, that
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   allow something to be effective and, you know, and fundamentally sound, that
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   you can do almost anything.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.960]   And I think that people will continue, particularly in the Gi, it's going to
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.200]   get nuts, you know, just the level of the amount of, of things that you can get
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.960]   away with and do and, and different grips that you can make.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:04.640]   But, I'd say what we're looking at right now is going to look only somewhat like
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.320]   what Jiu Jitsu is going to look like in 30 years.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.560]   The same way the Jiu Jitsu we see now is so much fundamentally better, honestly,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.480]   and, and more evolved and adaptive than it was 20 years ago.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.760]   And people will swear up and down like, Oh, back in the day, it's like back in the
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.080]   day, people didn't know how to fight very well, even 20 years ago, the level of, of
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.520]   people understanding how to deal with Jiu Jitsu was very reduced.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.880]   So you could get away with all sorts of pretty questionable stuff.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.160]   Like sitting in front of someone in close guard and have them not completely
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:33.960]   kick the shit out of you.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.760]   But, I think, you know, with particularly the advent of the barren bowl, the 50, 50
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.800]   position, all these different things, which have always existed, there's, they've
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.520]   always existed.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.200]   And when that's, I always hesitate to say invent.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   I don't like the word invent.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.000]   Like certain people use it a lot.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.040]   I'd say discover, because you could show me, I could come up with something.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.040]   Let's say Lex, you know, you've got a really good straight foot lock.
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.760]   I was watching you train last night and I could be doing that in a way that no one
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.520]   ever taught me.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.960]   That doesn't mean I invented it because you've been doing it forever.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.320]   But basically it's, let's say no one showed me the details you were using and I
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.680]   managed to stumble across them.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.880]   I didn't invent those details.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.120]   I discovered them and that was neat.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.000]   But again, none of us have invented a dang thing.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.760]   People have had two arms and two legs for certainly as long as I can remember and
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.800]   probably longer than that.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.080]   That's what I hear.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.280]   That's, that's the word.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.760]   So in the history books.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   Yeah.
