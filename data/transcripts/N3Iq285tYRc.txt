[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   Josh, a podcast listener from Evansville, Indiana, writes in, "Pastor John, I have
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.320]   a question about the local church.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.280]   I've seen a lot of people my age, college age, go to different churches, what's known
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.960]   as church hopping.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.000]   I continue to tell them about covenanting with one particular local church and why it's
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.660]   beneficial for their growth.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.000]   They continue to say that we are all part of the body of Christ and we as believers
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.680]   are free to go wherever we want.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.960]   What would you tell my friends?"
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.000]   Well, I would ask them a question, first of all.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.960]   I would ask, "How do you know those two things that you said, 'We all belong to the body
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.760]   of Christ and we are free to go wherever we want'?"
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.120]   I'd say, "How do you know that?"
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.080]   And if they say, "Because the Bible teaches that," then I would ask, "So you're saying
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.960]   you want to submit your will to what the Bible teaches about church membership, is that right?
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.520]   Are you saying that you will do what the Bible says about church membership?"
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520]   And if they say, "No," because maybe they're feeling trapped, like, "Whoa, where's this
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520]   going?"
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.880]   If they say, "No," then we've got a bigger issue to deal with, right?
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.560]   We've got to talk about the folly of presuming to create your own reality out of your own
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.240]   head when God is the one who creates reality and tells us what it is.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.160]   But if they say, "Yes," which I hope they would, then I would try to say, "Okay, if
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.760]   you want to live your life in submission to the Bible, then let's go to the Bible and
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   see what it says about church membership."
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.760]   And I would point them to at least five passages of Scripture.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.240]   So I'll just mention them and give a little trajectory here, and people can head off and
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   study that.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.080]   But I would say, have you considered the implications of Matthew 18, 15 to 17, where Jesus is making
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   the church, a body of believers called the church, the final appeal when considering
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.000]   the case of unrepentant sin?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.240]   Remember, if your brother sins against you, tell it to him privately, and if he doesn't
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.720]   listen, take two or three people and then tell it to the church.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.560]   And how would that church make any judgments if there weren't a number of people who regarded
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   themselves as the church?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.320]   Because at a meeting like that with such sensitivity, you can't just walk in off the street and
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.040]   say, "I'm a Christian, so I belong to this group that can determine the membership here
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.880]   or whether this person stays in or out."
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   So it seems to me that calling the church to make that kind of sensitive rendering assumes
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   there's some kind of definable group that can be counted on to do that.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's number one.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.640]   Number two is 1 Corinthians 5, 12, where Paul deals with the necessity of putting someone
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.200]   out of the church.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.600]   What do I have to do with judging outsiders?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000]   Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.840]   God judges those outside.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.500]   Purge the evil person from among you.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.640]   And so I see at least two implications there.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   One is that there is an in-the-church group and an outside-the-church group that he referred
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.240]   to.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.320]   Being in the church is definable.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.580]   So how is it definable if there's no such thing as membership?
[00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.280]   And the other implication is that a person can be removed from being in the church.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.420]   And so I would ask Josh's friends, are you part of a body of believers so that it would
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.000]   be meaningful for them to remove you if you walked into open sin and wouldn't repent?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.960]   Are you accountable to a group where that could happen?
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.360]   Because if you're just jumping around, I don't know how that could happen, how exclusion
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.160]   from an accountable group would make any sense.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.480]   Third would be Hebrews 13, 17, where it says, "Obey your leaders, submit to them, for they're
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.160]   keeping watch over your souls."
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   If you downplay the importance of membership, it's hard for me to see how you could take
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.000]   these commands to submit to leaders seriously.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.560]   We have to know who our leaders are if we're going to submit to them.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.920]   But if we're jumping from church to church, we're not likely, it seems to me, to come
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.120]   under that kind of leadership and give ourselves to that kind of submission.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.920]   And the fourth one, it seems to me even more significant, is how will leaders know whom
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.360]   they are accountable for?
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.760]   Because the Bible's pretty serious to us pastors when it says in Acts 20, 28, "Be
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.680]   careful and pay attention to the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.280]   to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood."
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.560]   How in the world, I mean, this is one of the biggest struggles for me all the years at
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.840]   Bethlehem is to whom am I accountable at the last day when the Lord says to me, "Did you
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.400]   keep watch over your flock?
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.360]   You will give an account for their souls."
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.480]   So who are they?
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:13.040]   And covenant membership became really crucial to us because lots of people came through
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.520]   the doors at Bethlehem, and there's no way I could fulfill this command for the thousands
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.440]   of people that rotated through those doors.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.640]   But I think there was a body who said, "We are here.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   We belong.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.860]   You're our shepherd.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.860]   We are your people.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:29.860]   We expect you to hold us accountable.
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.040]   We're going to hold you accountable to be a faithful shepherd."
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.280]   That kind of relationship, then it becomes definable, and I can be held accountable for
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.320]   whether I've cared for those people as I ought.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:50.160]   And the last one I would point to is 1 Corinthians 12, where the members of the body are described
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.640]   as members of a local body.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.200]   And if the person says, "Yeah, but in Ephesians 1 and Ephesians 4, Christ is the head of the
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.080]   universal body, and that's the body that I'm a part of," I say, "Right, right.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.400]   Yes, you are."
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.560]   But it's different and more specific in 1 Corinthians 12 because the head, we know this,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.600]   the head in verse 21 of 1 Corinthians 12 is not Christ.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.020]   It says, "The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need of you,' nor again the head
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.000]   to the feet, 'I have no need of you,'" which means that we are all part of a local
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.520]   body and we are functioning as a foot or a head or an eye or an ear, and in that body
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.300]   we are called to fulfill that gifting and that responsibility.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.160]   So I don't think Jesus died to create unattached, free-floating Christians.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:07:01.100]   I think he died to create the church where the real, true individuality of every believer
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.180]   comes into its own.
[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.620]   The more disconnected we are from a local church, the more confused we will be about
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.740]   who we are, who God made us to be.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:21.540]   We find our true individual selves in relationship to others.
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.540]   Well said.
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.540]   Thank you for that, Pastor John.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.220]   And we are putting the final touches on our preparations for the Desiring God National
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.780]   Conference, which begins here in Minneapolis next week at the Minneapolis Convention Center.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.060]   The conference is titled "Look at the Book, Reading the Bible for Yourself."
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.140]   It will be our 12th national conference, and it will also be our final national conference.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.340]   Bittersweet.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.980]   And I know many of you will be there.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.780]   As the national conference approaches, we return next week to address some of the most
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.100]   common questions we face trying to read the Bible for ourselves.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.140]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.220]   Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.220]   [END]
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.220]   1.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.220]   What is the Bible?
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   The Bible is a book.
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.220]   It is a book of words.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.220]   It is a book of ideas.
[00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.220]   It is a book of words.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.220]   It is a book of ideas.
