[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.640]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:20.040]   And in this episode, I have a very special guest with me, Sean Livingston, four-time
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.600]   NBA champion with the Warriors, three as a player and one as an executive.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.080]   Welcome to the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.640]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   I appreciate it.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.960]   It's great to have you on.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280]   You're definitely one of my favorite players of all time.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.460]   And we've gotten to know each other pretty well over the years.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.440]   And I really appreciate you reaching out.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.080]   I remember you first reached out, this was like your last two years of your playing career.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.480]   What was the impetus to reach out back then?
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.400]   So I had been playing for about 13 years at that point.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.080]   I think it was around 2018.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.680]   And it was kind of handwriting on the wall.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160]   You know, I went through some injuries.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.080]   We were going through our run with Golden State, but it was coming towards the end of
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.080]   my career.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   I feel it physically, mentally, emotionally.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.480]   And I was looking at the next chapter and came across this website, Financial Samurai.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.440]   I said, "What the hell is this?
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.680]   What is this?"
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.760]   And I remember just diving in and just talking about goals and not just retirement and planning,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760]   but also life.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760]   And I had just started a family.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.680]   I just had my first daughter in 2017, got married.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.200]   So just a whole new experience and really related to the website and been a fan member
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   ever since.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.680]   No, that's really great to hear.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   I mean, it's so funny that who would have thought you write a website and an NBA player
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.920]   would come and look and he's thinking about his future.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.760]   And I think that's great that you were thinking ahead.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.560]   And when you talked about the end was near and you talked about the mental and then the
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.760]   physical, what do you think goes first, at least for you, the mental exhaustion or the
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.360]   physical exhaustion of playing in the NBA for so many years?
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.320]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   I think it varies player by player.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.880]   Some guys have to retire real early.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.640]   You look at different sports like football, right?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   It's different.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.920]   For me, I think it was mentally and emotionally just exhausting from taking care of all the
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.760]   rehab, all of the training, all the whole process.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.000]   The process to be a professional athlete for some, some guys are super athletic, super
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.280]   talented, God gifted, wake out of bed and throw a ball 100 yards or run a 4-4-4.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.120]   But, you know, at that point in my career, just the, you know, the everyday minutiae
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   of really taking care of your body.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.480]   Also the travel, you know, getting up, traveling on the planes, getting in at 4am.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   This is, you know, an incredible lifestyle.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   You know, I was grateful for it, but definitely hit different in your 20s as opposed to, you
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.500]   know, your later career in your 30s.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.120]   So for me, just that mental and emotional exhaustion was starting to take place.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.080]   And also by then, how many championships did you win?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.320]   Yeah, we, we had, we were 2-1 at that point.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.200]   We were just going into 2018.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880]   So we had won our third championship that year.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.400]   So when you got three, it's kind of like, it's almost kind of like house's money.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.360]   You're like, yeah, I got it all.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.480]   So, I mean, the difference between three and four, it's kind of, is that a big of deal
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.760]   as going from zero to one?
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.800]   Yeah, I mean, it may not feel different.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.840]   It does feel different actually, because the first one, you know, it's nothing like the
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   first.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   Nothing like the first, right.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.320]   It's just like, it's just getting up there.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.360]   All, you know, the journey, it's like your life story, right?
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.400]   And you're up there and it's, you know, it's just this huge culmination of, you know, everything
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   you worked for.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.560]   But then, you know, I think going into the third one and then seeing the fourth one being
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.840]   won as an executive, you know, I think the appreciation, you know, and then the craftsmanship
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.520]   that goes into those because of, you know, you're relying on your experience, you're
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.320]   relying on kind of workforce knowledge, if you will, right.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.400]   You know, getting there, how to win, how to do it, as opposed to, you know, maybe some
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:44.080]   of that, you know, athleticism or just excitement, you know, wanting to really do it in the beginning.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.600]   But I'll take all the rings.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.000]   I mean, four rings.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.440]   Well, how many players in the NBA have four rings?
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   Do you know?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.440]   Yeah, no, man.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   Not a lot.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.000]   It's got to be less than a percent, one percent.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's not a lot.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.360]   I mean, it's, I'm grateful, you know, who would have thought, you know.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.160]   If I had signed up 2014, you know, I would have been on that journey.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   So right, right.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.160]   You know, best decision, best decision they ever made.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.040]   Hey, you had to accept it, right?
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.400]   You got to say no, go and stay.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.920]   I don't want the millions or whatever your contract.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   I want to stay.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   Where were you before Golden State?
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   So I was in Brooklyn.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   Right, right.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920]   I was in Brooklyn playing for the Nets.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.280]   That year, we had Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Darren Williams.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.560]   So they had some greats.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.840]   But it was, you know, it was a gamble because I had a chance to play, you know, it was the
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   year of 2014, 2015.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.360]   I had an opportunity to play for a couple other teams that offered me around the same
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.040]   contract, the same money.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.600]   But the opportunity was too great to play at Golden State.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.520]   And, you know, it worked out.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   It worked out.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.760]   No, it definitely worked out.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.360]   I mean, back in 2014, I mean, clearly you had to look at the roster composition and
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   the coach.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.920]   It wasn't Mark Jackson at the time.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   I forgot.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   That's right.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   Jackson.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.840]   But did you see that team and say, "Ah, this is a team where it has potential"?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.040]   How did you go about assessing that, the team aspect before making that decision to join?
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   It's interesting.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.560]   The year I was in Brooklyn, we played Golden State.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.120]   They were on an East Coast road trip.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.200]   And I want to say this was like the last or second to last game before they were going
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   home.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.840]   And they were on a back-to-back, just played Miami, who at the time were the defending
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.480]   champions, just beat Miami.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.760]   And they were really rolling.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   You know, they had a really good year that year.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.020]   Lost to the Clippers in the playoffs.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.360]   This was a night in January.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.080]   And I remember going to Chapel.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.800]   We go to the Chapels before games.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   You know, just regular routine.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   And who walks in?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   Mark Jackson.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   You know, Mark Jackson walks in.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   You know, I see him.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   I nod.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.720]   I say, "What's up?"
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.600]   We go through Chapel.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.000]   And then afterwards, he stops me.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.160]   And he's like, "Hey, man.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160]   Really proud of your journey.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   We're watching you.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160]   Keep going."
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   And I just remember, you know, just him giving me that affirmation.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.520]   And, you know, somebody that I really respected, Mark Jackson, one of the all-time great point
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.280]   guards out of New York City.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   Great coach at the time.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   Golden State's really rolling, having a lot of success.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.760]   And so, in the back of my mind, Golden State is like an option.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.360]   You know, it's like, "Oh, Mark Jackson kind of likes my game."
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   You know, I'm looking at Golden State.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.080]   They're a team on the rise.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.800]   And at this point in my career, I just want to be on a playoff team.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.720]   And I want to be in the playoffs.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.520]   Shooting for a chance for a championship.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.840]   That's all I can ask for.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.920]   And so, it's just funny how it came full circle.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.240]   Now, when I signed with Golden State, Mark Jackson had just got fired and Steve Kerr
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.640]   was the new coach.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.600]   And so, it's just, you know, ironic how things work out.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.720]   But I truly do believe, even if Mark Jackson would have been head coach, I might have been
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.320]   playing for Golden State.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.520]   Now, that's interesting.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   It certainly seems that the coach has a lot of sway in how the roster is built.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.280]   And you spent several years as an executive after you played.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.320]   So, how much power does the coach have?
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.160]   So, if Steve Kerr says, "I want some kid from this college or from this team on the East
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.240]   Coast in the NBA," how much sway do they have to bring them on board?
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.200]   Well, I mean, when you win multiple championships, I think that usually factors in.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   Right?
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.640]   So, it's really relative to your experience.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.960]   Similar to probably most corporate jobs, I'd imagine.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.320]   The more experience, the bigger your resume and your track record, I think the more autonomy
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.280]   that you may have from upper management or your board.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.720]   And in that case, Steve Kerr, he had earned his right to really sit at the table.
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.160]   And he's the one that's making the coaching decisions at the end of the day.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.560]   And so, for someone like him to not have a voice, I think it really hinders the development
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.040]   of the team and the direction you're going.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.040]   Right.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.360]   So, it's a case-by-case basis based on the coach and their relationship with the organization.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   Right.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   It does seem interesting because some coaches, like Doc Rivers was coach and president or
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   something.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.520]   So, it seems like he had more say.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.440]   And I guess some newer coaches have less say.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   That's right.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.880]   And you're seeing more of the hybrid roles, I believe, Greg Popovich, Doc Rivers, and
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.880]   Phil Jackson.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.800]   But these are household names.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   Right.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.520]   I mean, these are names that, you know, guys that won multiple championships.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.480]   They're honored coaches.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.960]   But I will say it's very hard to do dual responsibilities.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   Just like with anything.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.360]   You usually outsource maybe the CFO or CMO, right?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.480]   I mean, it's all different jobs.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.120]   So, I think with the structure of having a general manager in place and a head coach,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.200]   and then for those guys to really work together in tangent, that's found to have the most
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   success, I believe.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   Right.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.760]   Let's talk a little bit about your background because I know you grew up in Peoria, Illinois.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.600]   You're 6'7" and you went straight to the NBA.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.040]   So, to me and I think to many listeners, you've been one of the trailblazers.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.600]   You're like a prototype point guard, different type of point guard, like Magic Johnson who
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.760]   was 6'8", 6'9", and you went straight to the NBA.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:49.000]   So, can you talk about that journey from high school to almost going to college and then
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.400]   going to the NBA first and then how you were, I guess, viewed upon back in that day when
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   you were in high school?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   Oh, that was, man, that was a whirlwind of a time.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.480]   So, I graduated high school in 2004, it was class of 2004.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.360]   And at that time, LeBron James had just come out of high school and went into the NBA draft.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.320]   He was the first pick out of 2003.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.240]   And that was the famous class of LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh, Carmelo Anthony.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.400]   I mean, hall of famers, right?
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.120]   But LeBron James was the only one out of high school.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.520]   Kendrick Perkins as well.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.520]   He's a funny as can be personality.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520]   Perks, yeah.
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   So, it was a trend.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.120]   You saw a trend of high school players.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.800]   Obviously, the Kobe Bryants and the Kevin Garnetts, guys that have gone way before my
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.800]   time.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   So, coming into my senior year, I had a lot of whatever you want to call it, hype, you
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   know, around my basketball future.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.080]   While I go to college, while I go to the NBA.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.800]   And before my senior year, I signed on to go to Duke University.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   Right.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.200]   I was going to play for Coach K.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Coach K.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   Legendary.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200]   Legend.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   Drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Free tuition, right?
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   That's right.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.200]   That's right.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   That's right.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   Great university, great players.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.980]   And after my senior year, I played in a couple of All-American games in front of some Pro
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.980]   Scouts.
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   And I did some workouts.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.920]   And towards the end of my senior year, I was traveling on the weekends, getting out of
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.760]   school early Friday, going up to work out in Chicago with Tim Grover.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   Tim Grover at the time had worked with Michael Jordan.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800]   So, that was his personal career.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   And, you know, so at that time, MJ had just retired.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   Tim Grover had just retired.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.440]   Tim Grover was doing his thing.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.640]   And he had all the best talent competition coming, you know, and playing pickup, you
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   know, during the summer.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   So, guys would come back and play.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.000]   And so, this was kind of my foray into the NBA world.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.760]   And so, I remember doing a workout that Steve Kerr actually was at at the time.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   Oh, really?
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.080]   And he was the general manager of the Phoenix Suns.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   That's right.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.640]   And so, he was at this workout.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.080]   It was 30 NBA scouts.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.800]   And there was nobody else that I was playing with.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   It was just one on one workout.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   Really?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]   Just 30 scouts, you and…
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800]   30 scouts.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   And me and Tim Grover.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   Me, Tim Grover, and a rebound guy.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.080]   And he put me through this workout for an hour.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.600]   You know, I'm running, running full court, three dribbles, going, "Ah!"
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.000]   Running right down three quarters, going, "Ah!"
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.720]   You know, like showing my handles, dribbling, you know, doing all these different drills.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   So, after the workout, you know, I'm still deciding, "Do I want to go to the NBA?
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.400]   Am I going to college?"
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.280]   And this was kind of my test.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.560]   And I remember Tim Grover, you know, he was kind of, you know, talking with the scouts
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560]   afterwards.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.720]   I'm going, getting dressed in the hockey room, kind of finish my second workout for
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.880]   the day.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   And he comes in.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.560]   He's like, "You're not going lower than seven.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560]   You're not."
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.560]   Oh, nice.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.840]   He says, "Atlanta Hawks, they got the seventh pick."
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.400]   He's like, "I know them."
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.840]   He's like, "We're not letting them get lower than seven."
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   So at that point, I'm like, "Okay."
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   Huh.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   All right.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   I could be top seven.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.600]   Like, that's realistic.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.480]   It's not just draft board.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.280]   It's not just a mock draft, right?
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.280]   All right.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.280]   So, I'm like, "Okay.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   I can go to college, right, and try to move up to top five, maybe top three."
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   Right.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.280]   Because, you know, backtracking, my goal, my dream was always to make it to the NBA.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:28.400]   I grew up in Peoria, Illinois, Chicago right up the street, the Bulls, MJ, championships,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400]   '90s.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400]   That was my dream.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Amazing.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.400]   Exactly.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.600]   So now, to be going through this, working out with this trainer, the whole nine, this
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.680]   was my dream to make it to the NBA.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:46.040]   So the probability and the chances of me going higher than top five, top seven were really
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.640]   low by going to college.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.680]   You know, because I could get injured as well.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.680]   Sure.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   I could get a heart attack and my stock could fall.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.360]   You know, there's different things.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.080]   So I went for it.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.360]   And so I entered my name in the draft.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   I hired an agent.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.800]   I ended up getting picked number four.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   Nice.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.120]   Number four pick out of high school, going to the Los Angeles Clippers.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.160]   And then it was just, I was like a deer in headlights.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.160]   I was like, "I made it."
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160]   You know?
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160]   You made it.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.640]   But then I get there and it's like newsflash.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.680]   It's like the journey starts all over again.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   You're at the bottom of the totem pole.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   You know?
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   It's like, "Get the towels, Rook."
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   You know?
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   "Get the bags."
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   Is it one year of hazing or in general?
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   Is that how it goes?
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   They do it differently.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   It's one year or 82 games, depending on, you know, you got to go through your whole 82.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.680]   So if you're injured that first year, you might have to make it up.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.680]   But usually it's that first year.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   And you know, so even back then you were going through this cost benefit analysis.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   You know, in high school you're like, "What is the percentage chance I'm going to make
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   it?"
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.680]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:16:01.400]   And you're like, "I'm going to make it."
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.200]   How does the money work in terms of the cliffs?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.120]   Like, is it, you know, how does that work?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.360]   First round money, second round money, guarantees.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   What does that look like?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.920]   So usually first round is guaranteed.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.080]   And then it's a tiered system based on the salary cap.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.560]   Obviously the salary cap has gone up over the years.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.440]   So those tiers have been getting bigger.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:32.080]   And you see, I believe the number one pick, maybe, you know, my year was making $4 million.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.840]   Now the number one pick may be making $12 million.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.280]   And that's for how many years?
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   For three years, guaranteed.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.280]   Got it.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.000]   With a fourth year option.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.160]   And so, you know, but if you're drafted in the second round based on the economics, some
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.900]   of those guys are signing longer term guarantee deals.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.240]   Some of them are signing non-guaranteed deals.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.880]   But the chance of you playing yourself into a higher deal, you can do that a lot faster
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.200]   than a first round guy.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.120]   If, you know, so you see guys like Austin Reeves.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.560]   You see guys like Gilbert Arenas.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   Max Struess.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.560]   Max Struess, exactly.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.320]   You see these second rounders who, if they crack the rotation and they start to play
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:22.560]   really well and their stock goes up, I mean, they could sign a long term deal, you know,
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.560]   $50, $60 million plus deal for their second, third year in the league.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.600]   Whereas as a first rounder, if they extend you and they continue qualifying options and
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.120]   different things like that, you might have to wait four or five years before you see
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.120]   a second contract.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.360]   Oh, that's fascinating because, I mean, another guy, obviously, is Draymond Green.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360]   Was he first round or second round?
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360]   Second round.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.400]   He was picked second round, right?
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.840]   And so he, nobody really kind of was thinking, "Wow, Draymond."
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.760]   But then, obviously, he went into the rotation when David Lee got injured and, obviously,
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.080]   he's a great player now.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.400]   That's a perfect example.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   That's a perfect example.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.200]   And he signed his long term contract after his third year, right?
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   Right.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.720]   I mean, so just, you know, all it took was one year for him to crack the rotation and
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.560]   move his way and then we win a championship and now he's, right?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.000]   So it's market timing sometimes as well.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.800]   So, I mean, in that sense, in that sense, would it strategically be better maybe to
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.000]   go in a later first round or early second round so the expectations aren't as high so
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.600]   that you have less pressure and you can work your way in versus being a top 10 pick?
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.360]   Then it's like, "Oh, man, so much expectations."
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.080]   And then you could be a bust and then all that pressure is on you.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.080]   What do you think about that?
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.080]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.800]   You know, I think, again, it's one of those where it comes down to the individual.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.840]   I'm a guy where you have to go for it.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.000]   You got to go, you know, don't leave anything on the table.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Like if you get a chance to go as high as you can go.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.080]   But I do, what I will say is I do believe it matters where certain players go, right?
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.600]   For instance, you can look at an organization like the Miami Heat, you know, and the way
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.360]   that they approach things and you look at second rounders able to maximize their talents.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.200]   And I believe they get the most out of guys, right?
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.800]   And so, you know, that matters for certain players who, you know, they may need a certain
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.680]   level of coaching or a certain level.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   Who are their teammates?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.720]   Who are guys they've been playing with?
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.920]   Does it complement their skill set?
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.440]   Does it complement their personality, right?
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.680]   So those factors, I think, weigh in on a player's value and a player, you know, how well he's
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.680]   able to perform on the court.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.680]   Right, right.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:53.040]   Let's say you have two variables, your work ethic as a player and your God-given talents
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.000]   with your physical abilities, IQ and all that.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.080]   What do you think differentiates or what do you think is more important to getting to
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   the top?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   Because you got to the top, right?
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.000]   Like nobody gets the NBA, literally 0.01% of people get in the NBA.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.520]   You have so many ballers all across America, all across the world.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520]   Nobody gets in.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520]   How many people are on the team?
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.360]   Like less than, whatever, 15, 16.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.560]   It's so hard to do.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:27.080]   So what would you say was more important for you to get to where you got to go?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.680]   Your talent, your God-given talent or your work ethic?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.360]   Like what does that ratio look like?
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.800]   Yeah, yeah, it's a good question.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:40.600]   I'm a believer that your work ethic, I mean, some guys are really gifted.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:47.640]   Some people just have God-given talents, God-given IQ, athletic ability, whatever it is.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.960]   But I'm a firm believer to get to that 0.0001.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.840]   I talked earlier about it starting over and when you get somewhere you feel like you made
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   it but even when you get there, there's a pecking order.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.720]   You're in the sport of competition.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.360]   So in life, yes, comparison isn't healthy.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.680]   But in competition, that's exactly like you're looking across, you're constantly weighing
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.640]   yourself against others, trying to outperform the other guy.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.920]   So in that course, you have to have a work ethic and there has to be some level of, I
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.960]   don't want to say insanity with that work ethic, but it has to be consistent over time.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.760]   I think that's where you get a level of professionalism.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.680]   That's where guys learn how to be professionals.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.720]   It's when you do something over and over and over again on the days especially that you
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.840]   don't feel like doing it, especially when you're sick, you don't feel well because guess
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   what?
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.280]   Life is continuing to happen.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:58.160]   We have things happen, our spouses, girlfriends, kids, families, financial difficulties, the
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.520]   community, whatever it is that's coming your way.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   And so are you going to let those things be distracted from you focusing on the main thing?
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.920]   That's the main thing that got you there.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.880]   And so I think that ratio has to be tilted towards work ethic because the talent is what
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.000]   it is.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.840]   Some of that is, you're already there, especially if you made it to that level, which is already
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.240]   really hard.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   It's already really impossible.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.520]   There's 450 jobs in the NBA.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.640]   And that's one of the top leagues in the world.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.040]   And so I just think that work ethic and that consistency has to be there or else your shelf
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.520]   life is only going to be so long.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.640]   Darrell Bock Yeah, because if you're not doing it, someone
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.200]   else is doing it.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.560]   And I didn't really realize it, but every single year you play, I just kind of take
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.640]   it for granted as a viewer and as a fan.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.680]   Oh, Shawn Livingston is great.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.680]   Steph Curry is great.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.120]   MJ is great.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.520]   But every single year someone's coming into the league trying to take your lunch, eat
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.080]   your lunch, and they're going to be your teammates.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.440]   So you got to be cordial, but also they're trying to take your lunch too and get that
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.320]   big contract.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.880]   So you got to really work.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.120]   You got to keep on going.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.720]   Jullien Gordon Every year.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.960]   Every year there's 60 guys, probably 30 to 45 of them are going to be on your roster.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.160]   So you're adding one, two guys, maybe more.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.120]   And so again, you might strike gold once, you might get lucky, you might get an opportunity
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.280]   based on your talents, but how can you sustain that level of performance?
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.120]   How can you continue to have value to a team?
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.440]   And so to me, that's why looking at the household names you see, LeBron James, Stephen Curry,
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.840]   the sustained greatness, their peaks were really super high.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.960]   And obviously they'll be in those conversations, but where you start really separating yourself
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.520]   is the consistency, the sustained greatness of what they're doing.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   20 years, I mean, that's pretty incredible to play at that level, like a Tom Brady or
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   what LeBron's doing.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   Right?
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.520]   MJ LeBron James Right.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.840]   And I also have to imagine that a lot of luck is involved as well.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:22.120]   Because here in, let's say, the corporate world, the CEO of a company, or not even CEO,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:28.160]   let's say just a boss in a division, I truly believe a lot of people can take over the
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.720]   role as the boss or the CEO, but they're just not given the opportunity.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.220]   And I'm sure there's a lot of ballers out there who will probably be great or good enough
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.160]   to play, maybe not a lot, but they're just not given the opportunity.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:50.440]   And so when I look at, for example, coaches, when I saw Steve Nash get the job as a head
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.800]   coach at Brooklyn Nets, I was like, "What?
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.320]   The guy's never coached in his life.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.960]   Yeah, he's a Hall of Famer, he's a point guard, but how did he get the job?
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.960]   Why did he get the job?"
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.480]   I mean, I'm sure there's a lot of assistant coaches out there grinding it out, thinking,
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.520]   "What's wrong with me?"
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   And so it seems like the opportunity is really important to be able to showcase your skills
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   and succeed.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   What are your thoughts on that?
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.240]   MJ LeBron James Yeah, it is.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.440]   You have to, definitely have to have a chance.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.640]   But I think what Steve was able to accomplish in his pro career, there's a lot of knowledge
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.760]   and there's a lot of value in that, especially with sports being different in the fact that
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   he was a former player.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:36.680]   And I think players, there's something about that correlation there to where we understand
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   the grind, right?
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.160]   We understand what it takes.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:45.440]   We understand the dog days, and the ups and downs and the roller coaster.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:51.160]   So I think an example like that, yeah, he didn't have any experience.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.480]   Neither did Steve Kerr, right?
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:01.360]   And so you look at those guys, but what they were able to accomplish in the game as players,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:08.700]   their respect from former players and players, I think some of those things and dynamics
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.800]   can outweigh the tenure, right?
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.040]   Just being there and having the experience.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.200]   Not that it should, you still have to perform.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.640]   I mean, he's not the coach there yet, because obviously, right?
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.400]   It's a quick turnover.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   And what have you done for me lately?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.520]   I mean, that's the nature of pro sports.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.640]   But yeah, opportunity is important too, I would agree.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.680]   Ramon Maldonado And I think one of the reasons why I'm, one
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.000]   of the things I'm getting at is when I see the majority of the NBA consists of black
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.120]   players and there aren't more black coaches, that to me, seems like there's a problem.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.920]   To me as a fan, I'm like, why aren't there more black coaches?
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.640]   Because a lot of them have played in the NBA, they have the pedigree, they have the experience.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.920]   I look at your resume, Sean, four championships, three as a player, one as an executive.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:09.200]   You've got authority, you've got respect, you're calm, you have experience.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.280]   Why not Sean?
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.120]   And so that's the thing that I'm thinking about.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:20.320]   Do you think there's an issue with that in the NBA, where there aren't more black coaches?
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.240]   Sean Larkin I don't personally think that there's an issue
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   with that.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.160]   I think the NBA has done a great job in the diversity field, to be honest with you.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:36.880]   When I look at the landscape of professional sports in general, now, yes, football and
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.520]   basketball, there are a majority of African Americans that play that sport.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.960]   So that's true.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   I don't have the statistics in front of me, so I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:58.320]   I do know that the NBA has been trending towards more African Americans in the coaching spot.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:06.400]   Now in the executive suite and management, I think that's something that the NBA is looking
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.480]   to grow as well.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.920]   I think that's something that's important for the leagues to grow as well.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.440]   Because again, you looked at the players and the relationships with the players.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.080]   It's just important to have synergy all the way across.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.760]   That's not to say that different races can't get along.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760]   That's not the point.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.960]   It's more just about the opportunity.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.240]   It's more just about the communication and the respect.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.880]   Giving that opportunity to guys that have played as well is important.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880]   They know what it takes.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   They've walked in those shoes.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.040]   So I just think it's building those other skills.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:50.360]   Can you build those other skills, the soft skills, the day-to-day management skills,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.040]   some of those corporate skills?
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.880]   Can you build some of those for some of these employees?
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.840]   I think the NBA is doing a good job of trying to move in that direction.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.840]   All right.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   All right.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.240]   I'm just an outsider looking in.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.520]   I'm going to name names and not to bag on them.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.480]   Coach Popovich, obviously a legend, right?
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.680]   I think anybody would be honored to play for him.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.280]   He's a legend.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.140]   But let's say there's another coach who's never played in the NBA before.
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.560]   You don't share the same cultural background.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.280]   And let's say they've never won a championship.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.160]   Does it take, as a player, a little bit of time getting used to it and buying into that?
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   Is it harder?
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   Absolutely.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160]   I mean, definitely.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.960]   I think any new coach, it's going to take time to buy in, depending on the player, depending
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.360]   on if you have a veteran team, you have a young team.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.360]   What kind of players do you have?
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.920]   What kind of team do you have?
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:43.920]   That matters.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.320]   And then from there, how equipped is the coach as far as his knowledge?
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:54.080]   I mean, he doesn't have experience, but does he know what he's talking about?
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.240]   As far as when it comes time, right?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.760]   I mean, when you get up here, we can talk X's and O's.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.880]   But when you actually get in the game and you have to start making some of these decisions
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.520]   in real time, that's when you start to really know, you start to cut through the weeds.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.880]   So yes, it does take time for any new coach.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.400]   You look at Steve, like I mentioned, Steve Kerr.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.760]   That's a great example.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.800]   We won a championship our first year and we had the best record in the league, but there
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800]   were still hiccups.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.520]   There were still adjustments.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.160]   You mentioned Draymond Green, right?
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.440]   David Lee was an all-star.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:32.080]   When he came back from his injury, he was an all-star the two years before.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.400]   So he didn't want to go back to the bench.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.400]   So how do you navigate that?
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:46.120]   And so those are some of the things that are hard to really teach.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.000]   Those are people skills.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.800]   So that's where you really see coaches start to separate themselves.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.280]   Not everybody has them and not everybody, I don't think, has to have them, but I think
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   you have to have a basic level of that in professional sports.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.440]   What are your thoughts about being a coach or an executive in the future?
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.000]   Yeah, well, obviously, dove in the last three years with the Warriors and that was great.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.720]   Gave me a chance to kind of learn as much as possible, get a peek behind the curtain,
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   if you will.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.920]   But coaching, not right now.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   Coaching is more about, I think coaching is about the schedule and right now I'm looking
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.920]   for more flexibility.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:36.760]   Personally, just after playing for 15 years and just the whole process and the grind.
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.840]   It is a grind and I loved it during that time as a player.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.040]   But I think it's more of a timing thing.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.120]   But for me, I think my skill set, I think I would like coaching.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.840]   I would enjoy being in the gym, being around players and also having the temperament for
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   coaching.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.840]   So, we'll see.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Maybe down the road.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.400]   How about when LeBron brings the NBA team to Vegas in two or three years and the kids
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.840]   are a little bit older and you're itching to get back.
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   Does that sound perfect?
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   Sounds like a forecast right there.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   That's my job.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:16.840]   Forecast the future.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.320]   Sometimes it doesn't come true, but I mean that sounds to me like a no-brainer.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   What do you say?
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   That's right.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320]   That's right.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.320]   You never know.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   Endless possibilities.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   You got to keep your options open.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:37.360]   You know, I'd love to talk about the money part of the NBA because as a fan, as obviously
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.240]   players, there's big money involved in the NBA.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.360]   And I would just love to hear from you.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.720]   You go from high schooler directly to the NBA and so you got this multi-million dollar
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.260]   contract and then obviously over time you were able to sign more contracts.
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:00.440]   How was it like suddenly coming into so much money and is there kind of a money management
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.760]   program in the NBA to help players keep their money?
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.320]   There are programs for players.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:16.520]   There is a rookie transition program usually for guys, but it's more of a crash course
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:23.520]   where guys get together for three or four days and the NBA Players Union puts on kind
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.160]   of like a crash course of what life is going to be like.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   Right?
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.160]   Kind of a simulation if you will.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:34.640]   And they bring in different professionals, experts, former players, panelists, but there's
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.040]   nothing like the real thing.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   Right?
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:42.560]   And so I think the most important thing is obviously your team.
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.560]   Who is on your team of people that you trust?
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   And when these athletes are coming in, we're so young that we just don't have any experience.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   How could you?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   Right?
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.080]   I mean for me coming out of high school, I was just coming out of my parents' house,
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   my grandfather's house.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080]   Right.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   And you're in LA.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.800]   You've got millions in LA.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   That's right.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   That's right.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.720]   And so, you know, and that itself is kind of a myth.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.040]   Having millions right away.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   Right?
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.880]   It's like, you kind of have to work your way into it.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Right?
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:23.160]   I mean, you know, like I remember getting, you know, for me I signed a shoe endorsement
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:27.240]   deal with Reebok, which was a really big deal at the time.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:32.600]   And you know, I remember one of my first checks, you know, being a quarter of a million, almost
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.520]   half a million dollars and it was like, yeah, oh my God, this is the most money I've ever
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.520]   seen before.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.520]   Right?
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.520]   Sweet.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.520]   Let's go buy a Bentley.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.320]   I mean, and so to, you know, to experience that at such a young age, it's like, all right,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   let's go to the mall.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   Let's go here.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   Let's go there.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:55.920]   Fortunately for me personally, I was a very frugal and still am a very frugal human being.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.320]   So you know, so that was kind of my nature was always just to kind of like put it away.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   Don't look at it.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.360]   You know, and I just kind of continued with my same tendencies.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:09.840]   So I remember, you know, you don't really have any money when you, you know, you're
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   going into an MBA.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:18.280]   So when you hire an agent, you're getting a lot of credit and then this is money that's
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:24.520]   in advance that you really usually have to pay back, you know, once you sign your deal,
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.560]   once you sign, you know, and so, so that was the situation for me.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   Right.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.960]   So even that, you know, I'm kind of like, wait a minute, I got to pay all this money
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.960]   back.
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.000]   I bought a car, you know, I took care of some family issues and things.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.680]   And I remember flying all my, all of my family out to the NBA draft.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.240]   And so, you know, again, we're doing all this on, on, on borrowed credit.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:53.520]   And so again, when you're coming into, you know, a lot of money, it's easy to just blow
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.360]   it at that young age.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:00.520]   It's easy to just, you know, and take care of people and, you know, especially, you know,
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.480]   family and friends and needs and different things.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:09.920]   And so, you know, for me coming in at 18, I bought a house, bought a car, you know,
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.560]   I took care of some family things and that was it.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.800]   And I remember being that way.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.280]   You know, I had two cars probably for maybe about the first four years of my career.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   One house I did.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.920]   I bought, I take that back.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.200]   I bought a condo in Chicago, you know, when I went back to train in the summer.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.360]   But that was it.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.160]   And I continued to kind of remain frugal.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:37.760]   But as far as the structure goes, most players trust their agents.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.360]   Most players rely on their agents for that, you know, information as far as who's going
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.480]   to be your financial advisor.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.920]   What bank are you going to be going to?
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.720]   I need to get a chef, you know, I need to get, you know, some of these different day
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:52.440]   to day chores.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.000]   And so the agent is usually the kind of the center of the universe and on the business
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.800]   side and making those connections.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.200]   And so it's really important to have diverse people on your team.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.400]   And when I say diverse people, I mean people from different backgrounds, people, you know,
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   with different experiences.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.040]   Nine times out of 10, those are just usually our friends.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.240]   Might not be a good idea though.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.440]   Well, I mean, it's like, who do you trust?
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.440]   You trust the people you've known the longest.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   Exactly.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440]   Exactly.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:31.240]   It's like, I know you, like, you know, but nine times out of 10, again, they don't necessarily
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.000]   have, they're not experts in business, right?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   No.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   We're experts in playing our sports, you know, but not necessarily in finances or how to
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.200]   negotiate, you know, getting a car or, you know, different things or, you know, taxes
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.920]   or so.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.560]   So it's really important who you trust.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.400]   It's really important who's on your team.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:58.200]   And I think it's really important, even if you are trusting your agent to get a second
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   opinion.
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   Yes.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.200]   Right.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   Yes.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.520]   You know, my grandfather always said three, three opinions by people that you don't even
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.520]   know.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   All right.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.720]   Because then you take out the biases as well, you know, all right now, hopefully they should
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.920]   have some knowledge, you know, some market knowledge.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.920]   Sure.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.320]   But, you know, it's just important to kind of get different opinions.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:27.040]   And for me and all my decision making, like I haven't made always the best decisions,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.000]   but I tried to get advice from multiple points.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Right.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.320]   No, that's really great advice.
[00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:41.480]   Get three opinions, get those biases out and then really analyze where you want to put
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   your money.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.440]   And, you know, as a as an outsider, I always think to myself, man, if I had NBA money,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:54.040]   I would just put 80 percent of it in the S&P 500 index ETF and like, I don't know, 20 percent,
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.240]   maybe some bonds, especially now that rates are over 5 percent and then just kick back
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.760]   because in 10 years I'll have like so much more money.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.320]   I mean, that is like the easiest advice like one could have.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:11.400]   And the reality is over a 15 year period, I think your money would have tripled.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.800]   Except one thing you leave it on one thing.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   We are human beings.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   We are rational.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:23.080]   I mean, come on, what you just said probably makes the most sense.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:29.240]   But I mean, you know, if you probably tell 90 percent of guys, it sounds boring as hell.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   Come on.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240]   I'm 19 years old.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   What is that?
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Right, right, right.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   So so, you know, I say that to say, you know, again, the biases, the excitement, the uncertainty
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.800]   at the human emotion, like, you know, we're excited over things in the human.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.320]   Yeah, sounds that sounds amazing.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.520]   You know, right.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.920]   And then it's like, oh, actually, that could go to zero, you know?
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   And I mean, maybe not even zero.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   You might be liable for something.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920]   Right.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   You know, right.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.920]   You hear all these bad stories.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   Exactly.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.960]   So, you know, the older and more mature that I've gotten and also just experience from
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.080]   the losses that I have taken.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.520]   It's like, you start to realize, like, oh, wait, the boring things are the things that
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.320]   are actually making a lot of money.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   Right.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Really profitable.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Right.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   Right.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   Right.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.640]   You know, not always, but usually that that's what you see when you come in to, you know,
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.360]   to a lot of money is you get pitched by a lot of these exciting ideas.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.360]   Right.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   Right.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.960]   You know, and temptation is a temptation.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.320]   And then it's also, you know, the emotion of wanting to maybe help people.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.360]   And, you know, they're relying on your friendship and the trust and, you know, all those things
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.080]   get thrown into the pot.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:47.280]   And it's just about the actual idea and, you know, dynamics that go into making this thing
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   successful.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.280]   Right.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.280]   Yes.
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.400]   I mean, what's what's the average NBA career nowadays?
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.400]   Do you know?
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.600]   Well, it was five years when I was playing.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.720]   And maybe shorter or longer.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.800]   I mean, let's say it's five years plus or minus one year.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.280]   I mean, that's not a long career.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.400]   You're still 27 years old on average if you if you went to college, maybe you're 25 to
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   20.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.360]   And then you got your whole life ahead of you to figure it out.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:16.040]   So here's another point, you know, listeners should realize you played for 15 years.
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.120]   So think about that, Sean.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:24.020]   I mean, that 15 years has to be like a top 5 percent career in the NBA.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:29.320]   And then not only that, you were able to win four championships, was like a top 1 percent.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:34.800]   So I mean, if you ever feel down or bored, you just got to remind yourself about those
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   two things.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.720]   It's like, I mean, holy blessing.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720]   That's amazing.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.720]   I'm blessed.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.080]   I definitely it's a blessing.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.400]   And that time might even be shorter, you know, three to five years.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.480]   But, you know, I played 13 years, two years I was out, you know, with injuries and right
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.400]   calling my way back into the NBA.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.560]   You know, yes.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.360]   Different leagues and, you know, rehab.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.080]   So I mean, it's, you know, I mean, it's everybody has their own journey, but you got to you
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.480]   got to focus on yours for sure.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.040]   Now, I hear you.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.240]   Well, Sean, it's been great talking to you.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.520]   We could talk for hours and hours and hours.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.720]   Maybe we talk again.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:20.480]   I'd love to know, you know, keep in touch and hear about your journey post retirement
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.480]   life.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.840]   I mean, I guess in conclusion, can you just talk about what's life like?
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.760]   You're technically an early retiree.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:33.520]   You know, it's funny, you retired from the NBA, basically about my age, 34, 35.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.640]   And then you took a break, right?
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.280]   And then you went back in and then you kind of are retiring again.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.480]   So we're very similar in terms of like our career paths.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.920]   And so what's life like now as a second time around retiree?
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   What are you up to?
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:51.920]   What do you like to do?
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.400]   Yeah, no, it's it's been great, man.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.840]   I mean, honestly, it's it's you know, it's one of those things to where you just you
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.360]   know, for me, it's like I go with the flow with what's best for my life for the next
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.520]   kind of for that year or, you know, for the next five years.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.480]   And for me, it's just when I retired from the NBA, it was it was a shock, you know,
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.400]   because it's something that I did my whole life.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.800]   You know, what am I going to do now?
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   Right.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:27.920]   So this time around, you know, after leaving kind of the executive position with the Warriors,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.480]   you know, I'm just looking forward to, you know, trying things, trying new things, you
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.760]   know, during this period, I could always I feel like have an opportunity if I'm lucky
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.360]   enough or fortunate enough, you know, to go back and try to work in the NBA.
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.080]   Yeah, I'm sure you can.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.400]   No doubt.
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.760]   So, you know, I feel like while I'm young, you know, my kids are young.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.960]   You know, we just you know, we just transitioned to a new state.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Why not try it?
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   Try things while I can.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.400]   So, yeah, I mean, going doing different things, going back to school, doing different investments,
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.120]   doing community work back home.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:09.760]   Just focusing on different initiatives and things that, you know, I enjoy doing with
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.320]   my time.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.720]   But I can't be a busybody.
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.760]   So, you know, it's like trying to keep that anxiety off you of like constantly, you know,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   work or do something.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   Right.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   It's like an entrepreneur life.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.600]   Like, yeah, you've got to figure out a healthy balance of balance, schedule look like.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.760]   So that's right.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   That's where it's at.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   That's where it's at.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.960]   I mean, it's it's tough because obviously, the NBA career is a grind during the season,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.640]   traveling, working out and everything and then to just suddenly shut it off.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.000]   I know you and I, we went for a walk down in the marina that during COVID and it's just
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.320]   trying to figure it out.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:50.960]   It's just and I'm really glad you went back into the executive world because you saw the
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   other side.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.960]   Right.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.160]   And now if you never go back for some reason, you will at least never wonder what was it
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.000]   like.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.160]   And that that is actually really powerful to have a regret minimization where you won't
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.640]   wonder because you tried it.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:14.120]   And so I really enjoy your journey and I hope you do a lot more great things.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.840]   And what's next?
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.560]   I mean, I hope I hope to see headlines one day, you know, within three years, you know,
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.640]   Sean Livingston joins X team as the GM or whatever.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.040]   I think that'd be great.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:32.160]   And I think by then you'll have enough downtime to sow your own and do other things.
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   Hopefully, you'll invite me back on the podcast.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   I hope you come back.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   All right, Sean.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.160]   All right.
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:41.160]   Catch you later.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   I appreciate it.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   Thank you.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   All right.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.160]   Thanks for having me.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   Hey, everybody.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   I hope you enjoyed my conversation with Sean.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.440]   It was truly an honor and a pleasure to speak to him and listen to his journey.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:57.000]   He went from the highest of highs as number four pick in the draft to the lowest low.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.040]   It was after a devastating knee injury and then how he battled back through multiple
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.200]   teams to land with the Warriors to win not three but four NBA championships.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.680]   What an amazing story.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.760]   What a blessing.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   What a journey.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:16.200]   I am absolutely sure he will be an incredible coach or an incredible general manager if
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.440]   he is given the opportunity if he decides to pursue that path.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.120]   One of the things that really stood out to me from this conversation was how important
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:29.640]   work ethic was and is to sustain an NBA career.
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.720]   We're talking an average career lifespan of four to five years, but Sean lasted for 15
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720]   years.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.480]   So it's not good enough to be talented.
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.400]   You have to work on your talent and keep on going.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.040]   All right, everyone.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.640]   If you enjoyed this podcast, I'd love a share, subscribe and a positive review.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.760]   It helps keep me going.
