[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   >> Hi, this is Jeremy Howard,
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.240]   and you're listening to Coffee Time Data Science,
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.040]   a podcast for data science enthusiasts where I interview
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.920]   practitioners, researchers, and Kagglers about
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.440]   their journey experience and talk all things data science.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.120]   Before we begin, I apologize for the change to our schedule.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.840]   Of course, usually you would be seeing
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.360]   Chai Time Data Science on this channel with Sanyam Bhutani.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.400]   Unfortunately, he's not available today.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.920]   He had a prior appointment on
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.560]   another podcast and he was not able to join Chai Time Data Science.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.240]   So we hope you enjoy this special episode of Coffee Time and Data Science.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.680]   Without further ado, I would like to invite our very special VIP guest,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.080]   newly anointed Kaggle Grandmaster, Sanyam Bhutani.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.880]   Sanyam, welcome to Coffee Time Data Science.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.840]   >> Thank you, Jeremy. Usually, I'm very anti-coffee,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.960]   but I'll have to allow that.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.800]   I still can't believe you weren't kidding.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680]   I mentioned in our message also,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.000]   I think I don't deserve this, but thank you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400]   Thank you for doing this. Of course, I couldn't say no.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   >> Oh, it's my great pleasure.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.360]   Thank you for agreeing to be an inaugural guest on our show,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280]   and apologies for the inappropriate choice of beverage,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.080]   but this chalier coffee is our national drink, so.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240]   >> Actually, at Voke,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.040]   we were having this funny thread where people were pulling my leg,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.800]   when you shared the expresso to eat,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   and everyone was like, "Hey, see Jeremy's drinking coffee.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120]   You should switch over now."
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.240]   >> I will say though, I just purchased
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.280]   three different styles of oolong tea from China.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.720]   So I also like my coffee.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480]   It's very hard to find good tea here though, honestly.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.200]   So I actually had to get it all specially imported.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   So I would certainly love to hear about your tips on Indian tea,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.200]   because I'm much more familiar with the Chinese variety.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   >> My mom makes it for me.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840]   So every time I have a podcast,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.760]   she makes it for me even today.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   She woke up before me.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.040]   She made two chai, one for prep, one for now, so.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.360]   >> Great. So that's great for our listeners.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.880]   If you want a nice cup of chai,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.840]   head over to Sanyam Bhutani's mom's house,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.080]   and grab yourself a nice cup of tea there.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   Terrific. Well, let's talk about data science.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.240]   As we said, I guess the stimulus for doing this interview
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.360]   is your recent Kaggle Grandmaster anointment.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.960]   So why don't we start there?
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.160]   What are you a grandmaster of,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.360]   and how did you achieve that lofty status?
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.600]   >> So as you can see, I'm talking a lot,
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   and I've become a grandmaster in the discussions here.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   So I'm only right now good at talking.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.600]   Kaggle's belief from left to right
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640]   is the hardest to easiest category.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.120]   Jeremy was the first,
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.760]   I think Kaggle Grandmaster,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.200]   the first ranked in competition.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.520]   So I'm trying to move towards the left end slowly and slowly.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.000]   >> I would say datasets contributor,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.080]   maybe not so hard.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.360]   There are probably ways you could game that, I reckon.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.520]   For example, I bet if I put all the datasets
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.840]   from the course on Kaggle,
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.880]   I would become a datasets grandmaster.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.400]   I'm one gold away from being a Kernels Grandmaster,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.760]   which I should definitely get back to doing Kernels,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.520]   because they're so fun.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.880]   So when I ran the Masters Machine Learning course at USF,
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.280]   I actually, the marking for the course
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.800]   was based on how many points you got on Kaggle competitions,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.680]   Kaggle discussions, and Kaggle Kernels.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.040]   I always said to them, if you can write in a way
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.440]   that people find compelling,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520]   explain data science in a way that people find useful,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.800]   or build bottles that are highly predictive,
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.880]   then you've got a good opportunities ahead of you.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.240]   >> I think sometimes kernels are a bit flaky.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.320]   I've been spoiled with this box,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.880]   and I'm so used to things running instantly.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.360]   Sometimes I get a bit annoyed,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.120]   but people sharing stuff on there is awesome,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.360]   and I always learn so much.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   Every time I go on the kernel stuff,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.560]   the Kaggle community makes it super awesome.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.520]   >> What's the flaky bit?
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.720]   >> I'm just used to running cells super fast,
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.000]   like Kaggle kernel takes longer to start.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.920]   >> In the actual compute environment, I mean,
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.320]   I treat it as a platform for
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.200]   communicating to people rather than a compute environment.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.960]   >> For sure. What are you up to when you're
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.880]   not being useful on Kaggle discussions?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.640]   Where are you working now?
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.760]   >> I work at Meets and Biases,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.840]   and we have an awesome fast A culture internally as well.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's like working with friends,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.080]   working on site projects with friends.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120]   I lead our community efforts,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.320]   which basically means I just do what I love.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.760]   I host live stream for the broader community,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.120]   our CEO, Lucas B World,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.360]   whom you know and our Head of Growth,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.800]   Lavanya, whose team I work on.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.640]   Both of them are super supportive of community stuff,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.200]   so they just let me do whatever I want.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.280]   Every time I go with a stupid idea up to Lavanya,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.680]   taking a stupid idea to her,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.240]   she's like, "This sounds good to me.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.080]   If it sounds good to you, just go ahead with this."
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.360]   So I get to do what I love,
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.760]   and for some reason, they pay me for it.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.280]   >> Yeah. Well, Lucas is a super awesome human being
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.720]   and also a very smart guy.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.920]   I know a lot of the fast AI community
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.040]   have made their way over to Weights and Biases
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.400]   and hopefully are doing positive things in that company,
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.560]   which is already going very well.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.120]   I know it's actually in terms of all of
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.800]   the logging frameworks and deep learning,
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.960]   it's the best integrated with the fast AI library
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.640]   and the most loved by some degree,
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   which I guess is why it's the best integrated,
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.240]   so actually genuinely a good product.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.320]   Now, I first came across you when,
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.760]   I think when you posted a message in
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.920]   the fast AI forums a few years ago,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   introducing yourself and saying you're interested
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.600]   in learning about deep learning.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.160]   Now, remind me, when would that have been? What year?
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.920]   >> I'm so sorry. Just to add
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.040]   one small point to your previous question.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.280]   When I was interviewing for Weights and Biases,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.520]   I showed this to Lucas and I was going ahead and explaining
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.800]   why I spent so much time on our forums and he just,
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.560]   he stopped me there. He was super appreciative of this,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.920]   so he instantly recognized that I'm from fast AI.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.520]   Now, I get to work on the best experiment tracking tools team.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920]   But sorry to answer your question,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.240]   I got the opportunity to
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.760]   join the International Fellowship in 2017.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.600]   I was really struggling with the university.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.600]   I mean, I was doing okay with my grades.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.480]   >> So what were you studying at university?
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.640]   >> This is one of my most controversial messages I put out.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.880]   I was studying computer science,
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.800]   but I wasn't becoming a better programmer,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.600]   which is how I envisioned it to be.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.320]   >> At what university was that?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   >> That was SRM University,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.120]   so it's one of the good-known universities in India.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.560]   I went there expecting to just become better at programming,
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.120]   and I just didn't like the syllabus.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.600]   I was trying every single thing.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.560]   I was signing up for every student club
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.600]   and I just couldn't enjoy it.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.480]   Then I shifted to online courses,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   was trying to find something interesting there,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.640]   and somehow magically I landed on fast AI,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.720]   although initially I was terrified of it.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.600]   But for some reason I decided to-
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.720]   >> So let me just dig in a little bit more,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.320]   because I'm very interested, because I think a lot of people
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.600]   watching will be people who,
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.720]   like a lot of data scientists or people doing
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.240]   data science don't have a computer science background.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.000]   I think a lot of them,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.680]   I certainly used to be like this,
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.640]   looks over at the computer science world and thinks like,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.800]   "Oh, I probably should have done a computer science degree.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.760]   Maybe I should go back to university.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.120]   I'm never going to understand anything.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.880]   I'm not a real computer scientist."
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.480]   So you're saying that's not necessary,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.800]   and in fact you're saying you didn't
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.000]   learn much useful programming.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.080]   So tell us more.
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.040]   What were you doing in the computer science course?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.840]   What were you learning and in what way was it not satisfying?
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   >> One of the things I learned
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.400]   afterwards was any computer science degree
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.080]   is more of double ECS,
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.040]   so electrical engineering and computer science.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.120]   Half of it is just learning about diodes, stuff like that,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.040]   and that was absolutely terrifying to me.
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.360]   I had no interest in it at all.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.920]   I just barely passed in that subject.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.240]   I remember going to the professor and just asking them,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   "Hey, please don't fail me in this.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.640]   I don't want to take this class again."
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.360]   >> Does that work?
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.440]   Is he like, "Okay, I'll pass you."
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   >> Worked for a few subjects for me.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.360]   But I looked at the programming courses.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.160]   First-year syllabus in India is
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.440]   usually just the basics of everything.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.520]   So they teach you chemistry,
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.000]   they didn't even teach you biology and computer science,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.320]   and I just didn't like it.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.120]   I decided to go to the library.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.360]   I would pick out the senior yearbooks.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.560]   I would hang out in the section where
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   all the sophomores were hanging out,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.200]   and they were doing teenage stuff there.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.840]   I was the only one with a book in the library in a corner,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.360]   and even that was very outdated syllabus.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.680]   So it was just very mundane stuff,
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.080]   and I couldn't see the stuff connecting to real world.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.840]   So I would talk to people on the Internet,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.120]   they were building amazing stuff,
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.080]   and I just didn't see the connect happening at all.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.480]   >> Yeah. I mean, I remember,
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.680]   so I ended up majoring in philosophy at university,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.360]   but I did try many things along the way to try and
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.080]   find something that seemed more interesting,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.320]   and I did do a computer science subject.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:09.720]   It was like a programming and statistics class,
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.240]   and that programming was in Pascal,
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.560]   and I didn't understand any of it,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.520]   which I found surprising because I knew how to code.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.560]   I remember going, I found that textbook 10 years later,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.680]   and I went back and I reread it,
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.720]   and I was like, even though I know it,
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.360]   I've written production software in Pascal at that point in Delphi,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.920]   I still didn't understand the book,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.160]   and I realized like, okay,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.880]   the problem is not me.
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.520]   The problem is the book.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:44.960]   A lot of academics just aren't good teachers.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.720]   They make things just so hard to understand.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.400]   >> That realization came so late to me,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.240]   like two years into the degree,
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.040]   but still like that was super late for me.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.200]   I was just expecting my teachers to be super good at everything,
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.880]   and I would like go to them with questions.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.400]   Sometimes I just wouldn't get answers,
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.680]   and that would really annoy me.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.120]   Like how do they not know this,
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.040]   like they're supposed to know this stuff.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.720]   I remember in like one of my machine learning courses,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.240]   there was a question in an exam about what's the latest here,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.280]   and I had read a paper.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   I drew that architecture.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.920]   I was super proud about that,
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   and I got a zero because they said,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.560]   "This is not in the syllabus.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.080]   You're not supposed to write this."
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.360]   >> Oh, no, yeah. Oh my God.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.440]   I mean, it's not just university, honestly.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.320]   My daughter is six,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.880]   and so she's doing primary school,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.440]   and it's same issues.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.840]   They're like, "You're only allowed to be covering this part."
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.160]   We're talking about fractions,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.400]   but you're allowed to talk about halves,
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.160]   and if you mention quarters,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.800]   you're going to get told to stay in your lane.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.920]   It's bonkers.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.480]   You were looking for other material,
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.160]   for other things that might help you learn more pragmatic,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.640]   how to code, how to become a good programmer,
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.560]   and so it was during that search that you came across fast.ai?
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.600]   >> I first found machine learning,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   and then I tried.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.920]   I used to proudly say to my peers,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.120]   because it was like a status symbol to me,
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.800]   just a turning group, your effect rate.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.080]   I was at the initial bit,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.360]   and I would just tell them proudly,
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   "Hey, I did like 40 online courses,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.400]   and then I would go ahead and sign for five more."
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.000]   >> So it's just like Oceara,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.640]   or Udemy, or stuff like that?
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.320]   >> Every single thing, you name it,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.240]   I probably would have at least watched five minutes of it,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.520]   and then they did nothing.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.280]   I wrote an article how not to do fast.ai,
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.440]   where I would say, I would discover something,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.200]   find a course, study the course,
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.280]   and not be able to build something,
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.600]   and during the search somewhere in between,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.120]   I found fast.ai, and I signed up for fast.ai, luckily.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:03.840]   >> What was that experience like?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.040]   Was that different to other courses you're taking?
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.120]   >> I could feel like this was the first time I felt
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.840]   that I could build stuff that actually works,
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.640]   so it's not just those three layered neural networks.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.080]   I remember in the first two lectures,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.960]   you showed us how to get started on a Kaggle competition.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.440]   We put out a simple baseline, and we were beating you.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.600]   So I remember me and my roommate
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.680]   were taking the course together,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.840]   and we both were jumping for 10 minutes.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.880]   "Hey, Jeremy, how is this happening?"
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.960]   on the leaderboard.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.800]   So here is the aforementioned hownottodofast.ai,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.080]   which I do remember.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.280]   It's very, very helpful,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   and I've shared this with other people,
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.280]   and I think Radek has also shared some of these ideas.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.400]   It's interesting to me, yeah,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.600]   it's interesting like how few,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.880]   even machine learning courses are top-down.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.880]   So I always feel like if you're not creating useful models
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   reasonably quickly, then that's pretty discouraging.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.200]   And also, how are you going to know
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.400]   what's the point of the stuff you're learning about
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.280]   if you're not actually training useful models?
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.480]   It seems like it's pretty hard to integrate
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   the knowledge that you're being taught.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.760]   >> All of the courses would--
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.640]   Sorry. >> Go on.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.400]   >> All of the courses would like,
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.160]   now most of them are better,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.080]   but at that time they would start with
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.880]   showing this super cool style transfer example,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.080]   and then they would go back
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.520]   to just teaching the mundane stuff,
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.920]   how you do stuff in Nampai.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.240]   I was so done with that at that time,
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.680]   and Fast.ai was super awesome
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   because there was also this insane community,
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.720]   and usually when you take a course,
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.480]   you're in a similar cohort,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.520]   which is one thing I didn't like about university.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.680]   No one around me was talking about machine learning.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.600]   They thought I'm super weird.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.320]   I thought they're super weird.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.680]   But on Fast.ai, we had--
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.080]   >> What were they wanting to do?
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.000]   If they're not interested in ML,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.120]   what were their hopes and plans and interests?
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   >> Just do T-Net stuff, as I mentioned.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.000]   >> So it wasn't just ML,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.120]   but it's more just actually studying
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.920]   and learning effectively in general.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.400]   >> Yeah, and most of them were just building websites.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.040]   I didn't enjoy that bit at all.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.520]   I would just download templates
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.680]   and hack stuff together every time I wanted to do that.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.400]   >> Yeah, building websites
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.520]   is not particularly intellectually interesting
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.360]   of itself necessarily for sure.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.520]   So yeah, tell me about,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.280]   okay, so you got started and you said 2017, right?
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.920]   So how did that go from there?
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.000]   Was that then all smooth sailing,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.800]   or did you hit any obstacles along the way,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.560]   like anything that in hindsight,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.720]   you wish you had done differently?
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.800]   >> So you had already pointed to my article,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.080]   and I also was asking this question
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.880]   when I had the opportunity to interview Rachel,
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.520]   because I'm so new to top-down learning still.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.840]   In my entire student life,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.000]   which is 15 years I've been studying in the bottom-up way,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.400]   and I was so new to top-down,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.640]   I would always default to that.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.960]   So my issue was not listening to you enough.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.080]   The success I have was because I listened to you
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.920]   10% of the time, and other time,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.480]   I would just like, okay, this is not working,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.840]   I need to go and read the basics,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.240]   or again, default to bottom-up learning.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.880]   >> Exactly like Radek Khosmalski.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.520]   He says the same thing, yeah.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.320]   >> We both also talk a lot about this.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.880]   He even, we spoke about this for half an hour
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.320]   when I had the chance to interview him.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.520]   Even in this book, I think this is really a struggle,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.440]   because we always start with aspiring to be someone,
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.400]   and then we don't want to put in a lot of effort initially,
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.480]   and you don't see the dot connecting immediately,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.040]   although it takes an insanely long amount of time.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.080]   >> So can I ask, and feel free not to answer
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.320]   if this is too private,
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.600]   but how old were you in 2017
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.400]   when you joined the Fast AI community?
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.800]   >> So five years ago, I was 19.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.240]   >> 19, okay.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.200]   'Cause I ask because I,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.640]   you definitely stood out to me even then, you know?
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.000]   Like, and I couldn't exactly tell you why or how,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.380]   but you certainly came across as,
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.760]   you know, unusually motivated.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.960]   Now I will say,
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.760]   that's not that unusual.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.840]   There's plenty of people who joined the course
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.560]   sounding pretty motivated,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.640]   but then I would say like the big difference with you,
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:53.840]   the really big difference with you is your tenacity.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.060]   Like you didn't go away.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.960]   Like, you know, like if the multiple 100,000 people
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.260]   who start the course,
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:08.400]   you know, seeing it through over a multiple year period
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.040]   and doing the things,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.920]   like I remember you would even post on the forums
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.360]   and say like, you know,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.280]   in order to have something to force myself to live up to,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.460]   I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.640]   over the next few months.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.060]   Like, there it is.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.880]   What, do you have a sense of like, what's,
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.560]   how did you get to this point?
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.280]   Why are you more tenacious than the average bear?
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   And, you know, what's kind of helped you to stick with it
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.860]   and to follow through on your goals?
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.240]   - Yeah, you're being too nice to me.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.600]   So like, I would go away from Fast Day
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.800]   because I was like, maybe only Jeremy can do this stuff.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.760]   I'm not like as good as you of a programmer.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.080]   I'm not as good as you at reading papers.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.960]   So I would like go away to other courses time to time.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.160]   And again, like realize, no,
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.600]   I want to come back to the community
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.000]   and just the mad passion of really believing
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.660]   that if I stick to this would be really helpful.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.960]   One thing I've learned is like,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.360]   we always start aspiring to be some person as I was saying.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.960]   And we're like always looking at that end goal,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.840]   but instead I've over time learned
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.640]   to really enjoy the process more.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.440]   So like when I was trying to lose weight,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.160]   I was like, that was my fifth attempt at losing weight.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.680]   This time what made it stick was
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   I would just show up every day
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.680]   and walk for like two hours straight.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.480]   Like no excuses, just walk for two hours
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   for at least four months.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.640]   And then I started losing weight.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.120]   So broadly speaking, I just learned to appreciate
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.280]   the process of showing up every day and just doing it.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.120]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.760]   That's great advice, is to focus on the process.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.840]   I had a similar experience, gosh, how long ago?
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.000]   Seven or eight years ago,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.640]   when I decided to try to improve my fitness
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.200]   and I started going to CrossFit,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.240]   like CrossFit was literally a block away.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:13.120]   And I had really never done any kind of intense training
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.960]   in my life.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.620]   And CrossFit, you dive very quickly into intense training.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.300]   And each day I just felt awful.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.920]   I can't begin to tell you how much I hated it
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.560]   and how bad I felt.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.040]   And the other thing that makes it difficult
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.840]   was like everybody else at CrossFit
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.680]   is just so like gung ho about it.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.000]   So I think I must've felt a bit like you was like,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.760]   oh, Jeremy's better at coding than me.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.600]   I can't do it.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.640]   It's like, okay, these people are all CrossFit people.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.400]   But yeah, you know, it helped to have Rachel actually
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.680]   'cause we both decided to go every day.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.120]   So like, okay, we're gonna go every day.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.960]   I think it was like 5.30 AM, turn up, hate it, go home,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.140]   turn up, hate it, go home.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.480]   And after about similar time, I reckon about three months,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.440]   I was like, I still hated it,
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   but I didn't feel horribly sick every time.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.920]   You know, I was just like uncomfortable
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.060]   and a little painful, you know?
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.960]   Yeah, it's hard, isn't it?
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.280]   Because like to get stuff out of these,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.840]   any of these things, you have to turn up to the process
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   for months and those months are often not much fun.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.560]   - CrossFit is also super hard.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.920]   You take, in one day you get super exhausted
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.360]   and next day you have to show up again,
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.120]   half exhausted, you take thinking results aren't coming in.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.940]   What do I do?
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.140]   - Yeah, and I mean, so like when we're learning stuff,
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.340]   I think in university, it often seems to be
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.560]   the professors are proud of this, you know,
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.840]   like weed out classes.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.160]   They're like, oh, 80% of my class flunked out.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.120]   It's like, oh, you're a shit teacher, aren't you?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.120]   You know, like you wanna be giving people positive,
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.160]   real positive feedback all the time of like,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.360]   oh, wow, you just trained a model.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.480]   Oh, wow, you just fine-tuned a model.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   Oh, wow, you just created a web application, right?
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.880]   That's how computer games work.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.160]   You know, with computer games,
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.720]   you don't like start up Gran Turismo 7
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.480]   and it's like dumps you straight into an F1 car
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.100]   on Nürburgring and asks you to, you know,
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.400]   qualify for, you know, F1.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.480]   It's like, okay, we'll start with license test
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.340]   and I'm not gonna afford focus.
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.280]   Can you drive in a straight line for 50 yards or something?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.040]   And at the end it's like, congratulations,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.080]   gold medal, you've done it.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.800]   Okay, now we're gonna like show you how to do it
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.680]   and you have to press the brake pedal yourself.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.240]   It's like, congratulations, you did it.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   - I think one of the things I learned through gaming,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:47.920]   I used to game a lot.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   I would like sit down and game straight for 16 hours.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.940]   My parents weren't happy about it,
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.660]   but like I would just fight and I would fight it,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.760]   make that happen.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.920]   In games, we call it grinding,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.300]   where you like have to do this so stupid stuff
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.860]   over and over again, that just doesn't make sense.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.440]   But you enjoyed so much and like just,
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.920]   I think many Kagglers see this,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.200]   that like bringing that over to Kaggle,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.460]   because initially you just suck on the leaderboard.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.480]   I still suck on the leaderboard, I'm like bad competitor.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.120]   But you enjoy the process so much
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.520]   because it's the grind that you start enjoying towards the.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.200]   - Now you say that, but I don't think that's true
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.620]   'cause you've had some very good results
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.840]   in competitions, haven't you?
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.400]   - I had the chance to team up with awesome people.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.820]   So I was learning from them and contributing ideas.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.080]   (laughing)
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.960]   - Now, the other thing I noticed with you
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.440]   is in terms of follow through,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.160]   is you know, we often encourage people
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.960]   to kind of put themselves out there,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.840]   build their personal portfolio, blog, whatever.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.980]   Everybody says they're going to, not many people do.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.520]   And it's hard, I know like you've talked about how,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.120]   for example, this podcast, when you started,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.240]   no one's listening, you know?
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   It's just you talking out to the empty internet.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.120]   Like give me a sense of like,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.880]   what did that feel like to like, you know,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.000]   write blog posts when you didn't have a readership,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.560]   create podcasts when you didn't have listeners?
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.200]   Like, what did that feel like?
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.420]   And how did you push through?
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.060]   And then how did you get people to start noticing you?
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.560]   - I'll start with the tangent.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.680]   I think great people improve and like they reach heights.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.640]   Greater people keep, they uplift others
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.320]   and greatest people keep reaching higher heights in life
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.520]   and keep uplifting others.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.880]   So people like you and the Kaggle community
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.440]   and Fast hair community are the greatest
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.680]   because you keep uplifting others also.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   My blog got a lot of traction in the podcast
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.920]   because you and the community were sharing it so much.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.040]   But it was like super bad for me.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.660]   As you might know, I'm like extremely sincere
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.220]   towards anything I try and like I give it my best.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.720]   Otherwise I'd like just wouldn't sign up for anything.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.440]   That's how it is now initially it wasn't the case.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.800]   - Let's see, tell us more about that.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.960]   Tell us more about that, what do you mean?
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.780]   So, I mean, that's just such an interesting point.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.960]   So you're saying nowadays when you try, you really try,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.800]   but that wasn't always the case.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.320]   Tell me more.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.920]   - I would just like bail halfway through
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.880]   like three days into it.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.680]   One month into anything, I would just bail.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.940]   When I was trying to lose weight in university,
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.960]   I would like work out.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.760]   I worked out for one month super intensely.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.040]   So I decided I would climb, we had super tall buildings.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.600]   So like 15, 16 floors.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.160]   And I used to live on the ninth floor of the hostel.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.720]   Out of this like nowhere, I decided I'll climb 60 floors
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.120]   every day, at least 50 to 60 floors.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.680]   I did that for one month, damaged my knees a bit.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.960]   And then I just like gave up.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.200]   I didn't like start slow and build up.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.000]   - Right, so what happened, you just became more mature
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.600]   or was there some kind of like conscious decision or?
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.920]   - I think maturity, yes.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.200]   I'm still not very mature, but now I like start slowly
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.720]   and like remain at anything I do.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.240]   - Okay, so sorry, so go on.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.080]   So you're very, so at the point you started the podcast,
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.120]   you were sincere about putting your effort in and yeah, go on.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.420]   - Yeah, so when like I got to interview you
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.560]   or other agri-grandmasters to me,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.240]   it felt like I'm being insulted towards people like you
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.320]   because it's not getting too large enough audience.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.160]   And I felt like that's my job to like,
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.640]   if I'm asking for someone's time,
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.320]   I need to like put it out there.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.400]   And that part was super annoying to me.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.000]   Like how can I, this is something I'm putting out
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.160]   to the best of my ability.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.000]   How can I like not get it to the audience
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.620]   that I think it deserves?
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.200]   - Right, so how did you?
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.120]   And yeah, I mean, like even just to put out
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.720]   that next podcast or that next blog post,
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.920]   yeah, how did you convince yourself
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:13.000]   to kind of do it anyway and then did that audience
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.100]   like just gradually trickle in more and more
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.600]   or was there something that was like,
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.080]   suddenly you got noticed or yeah, what happened?
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.440]   - I learned this from Radeko Smulski.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.600]   He would post his goals and that's what I started copying.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.520]   So from him, I started, as you mentioned,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.160]   I now post my goals every single year also.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.600]   I just, now I also make a video about it
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.560]   so that like everyone, I'm terrified then.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.240]   Like I think everyone's watched that video.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.680]   Now I need to like do that.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.980]   And I switched from thinking about what's the outcome
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.000]   to like, I'm going to, when I was doing the podcast,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.100]   I decided I'll put out two episodes every single week,
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.200]   no matter what for like an entire year.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.220]   I just decided to do that.
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.620]   And I wasn't so much so looking at
[00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.880]   how many people are watching,
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.960]   although I would like pay some attention to it.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.060]   And instead I would just like focus on making the best version
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.640]   of the podcast every single week.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   Or before that I was writing blog posts
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.000]   and I committed to writing one blog post
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.080]   at least every week.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.640]   And I was just making sure I can write anything best
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.080]   to my ability at the time.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   So here is Radex's book where, yeah.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:29.400]   Highly recommended for, he's had a lot of success
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.600]   and has a lot of great tips.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.160]   I thought I'd better just share that
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.000]   since we've both been talking about Radex a little bit.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:41.040]   Yeah, it's what you described, you know,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.480]   which is like just trying to do a better job,
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.780]   you know, to get there.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.760]   It requires a certain amount of kind of like trust
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   in the system that there is some reasonable relationship
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   between working hard and getting good results, you know,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.560]   which I think is not obvious, you know,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.340]   like it's not obvious that that's true.
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:14.120]   And so, and if you don't believe that's true,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.280]   then it's gonna be very rough, you know,
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:25.000]   because it's just gonna feel like, well, why bother?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.680]   I guess, you know, actually I wanna share something
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.160]   which is I, to give a sense that it is true.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.800]   And so I mentioned earlier that I'm close to being
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.520]   a Kaggle Colonel's Grandmaster.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.520]   Here is the last few Kaggle Kernels I've uploaded.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   And you can see every single one of them
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   has got a gold medal, which is to say like I put my all
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:05.840]   into creating the very best Kaggle kernel I could.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   And yeah, it's like, and each time I have done that,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:21.160]   people have reacted to that by upvoting
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.200]   and liking my Kaggle kernel, you know.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.040]   And so like, I think like, if that doesn't happen,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.760]   it's important to self-reflect, you know,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.600]   same in a competition, a Kaggle competition.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.760]   Like I like these transparent metrics
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.640]   'cause you can't bullshit yourself about them.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.160]   Like, I mean, you can, but you shouldn't.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.920]   It's like, okay, if you don't get likes
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.960]   on your Kaggle kernel, you should assume
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.120]   'cause it's 'cause you didn't do a good enough job.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.000]   You know, you didn't explain it well enough
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.880]   or you didn't make it compelling enough
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.200]   or it wasn't a particularly good approach.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.680]   You know, if you sucked in the private leaderboard,
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.080]   you shouldn't assume you just were unlucky,
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.120]   but that, you know, this is an opportunity
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.220]   for you to learn how to do better.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.720]   - So sorry to disagree a bit, but initially,
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.080]   there's like always this period of suck
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.040]   where things wouldn't just pick up,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.560]   at least on Kaggle also,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.720]   when you're just putting out stuff or kernels,
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   I think it takes a while for people to start voting it.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.760]   So I would also like get--
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.800]   - Well, that's true, that you have to notice you.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.520]   Not in competitions, you know, not in competitions.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.320]   Yeah, I mean, certainly in podcasts and blogs and things,
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.600]   it's very different.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.600]   It's like, trickles up very, very slowly.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.000]   Like people often ask me how to get or Twitter followers.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.440]   And I'm just like, just tweet.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.480]   Like just, you know, and to try to make good ones.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.400]   Like I started with zero followers and then one
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.220]   and then two, you know.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.440]   It always goes very, very slowly.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.760]   - I'll share this one thing from my,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.240]   so this is titled as My First Kaggle Competition Experience.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.160]   And on the leaderboard--
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.520]   - How much is your name?
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.780]   (laughing)
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.360]   - There's a story behind it.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.240]   We were so naive.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.600]   We were trying to rename stuff and my teammate ended up
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.960]   cleaning up my entire laptop without command.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.200]   (laughing)
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.320]   This is how the first competition felt.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.520]   Like I was looking at the Kaggle Grandmasters
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.360]   and it was like, they're on a supercar,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.720]   I'm running barefoot and it's a 100 miles sprint.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.800]   I can't keep up with them.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.280]   I would submit to the leaderboard, sleep.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.200]   And as I wake up, I would have fallen down 50 positions.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.040]   I would come back, try it again, keep doing that every day.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.880]   And like, I finished in the top 20% I think,
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.720]   which also was like super awesome to me.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   - Fantastic, and again, that's like tenacity, right?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.560]   Like most people aren't gonna keep coming back.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.440]   And in my experience, the people who do come back,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.680]   make it, you know, like it's,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.600]   I feel like this is the number one difference
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.080]   between those who succeed and those who don't.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.760]   But yeah, coming back to your point about like for example,
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.240]   getting people to upvote your kernels
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.600]   or to watch your podcasts.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:20.240]   I guess what we're saying is having extremely good content
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.920]   is a necessary but not sufficient condition for success.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   So you do need to make sure that you're telling people
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.880]   about your Kaggle kernels or about your blog posts
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.040]   or about your podcast episodes.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.000]   But if you get people to look
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.800]   and they're not extremely good,
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.360]   they're not gonna come back and look again.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.160]   - One thing, and to credit,
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.360]   the blog started through Rachel's advice.
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.240]   I would just read it every week at least once
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.200]   and I would sincerely follow her advice
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.120]   on how to get started on blogging.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.840]   It's an amazing blog post that she's written.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.240]   That's how it got started there.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.560]   And I would just transfer my learnings to the podcast also.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.040]   But the podcast was like super bad in quality
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.000]   during the initial weeks,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.680]   but at the time that was the best I could do.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.720]   And one thing I've learned is I try not to spam too much
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.840]   with like sharing it over and over again.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.360]   So every time I've done a podcast,
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.800]   I've only shared it once with the world.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.880]   And I, if I re-share it,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.360]   it's because it's so relevant.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.760]   I say, "Hey, please listen to this.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.000]   "This is where I discussed this."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.200]   But I'm also like extremely sincere
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.360]   about not spamming the community.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.560]   Although like I do spam with my tea puns and tea jokes
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.400]   just for the sake of branding,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.520]   but I try not to spam too much
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.200]   with like any stuff I'm building.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.480]   - So this is Rachel's blog post,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.600]   which I've heard what you just said.
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   I've heard it from so many people
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.320]   that this is what got them blogging.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.840]   And you know what a lot of folks might not realize
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.840]   is Rachel, you know, she's a math PhD.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.400]   She's an academic.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:08.520]   The idea of putting yourself out there like that
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:13.320]   is an absolute anathema to her academic training, you know?
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.200]   And, you know, in the academic community,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.480]   which I'm also in nowadays.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.360]   Yeah, it's almost look, it is.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.200]   It's looked down upon, you know,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.040]   of like communicating in a clear way
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.680]   that the rest of the world can understand,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.880]   which is, it's such a shame, you know?
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.480]   And so it does require a pretty conscious decision,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.320]   I think, particularly if you're at university
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.280]   to be prepared to be different.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.360]   Because the people teaching you and supervising you
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.080]   have probably never written a blog post in their life.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.560]   And they probably have no idea what it really is.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.800]   And they're trying to get you to write
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.480]   the most obtuse academic jargony prose
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   in extremely exclusive PDF-only academic papers.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:09.760]   So tell me more about like
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.520]   creating educational content in general.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.480]   What's the kind of educational content
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   that you're finding is really gelling with people,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.280]   that people are telling you,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.840]   thank you so much for creating that,
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.160]   that made a difference to me.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.320]   I'm still surprised when people say that to me.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.920]   I'm like, I'm just creating this for my own self.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.400]   I just follow Rachel's advice,
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.960]   which is to create something that I wish was there.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   And that's how I started the podcast also.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.840]   I was talking to so many incredible people on Fast Day.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.640]   To Atini, who used to take the course,
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.800]   he taught me how to get started in freelancing.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.600]   And I would always shamelessly ask question.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.120]   I would always start with an apology.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.320]   Hey, sorry, this is going to be a super stupid question,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.880]   but I want to ask this to you.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.120]   And I would like just shamelessly approach people,
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.040]   ask these questions.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.760]   That's how the podcast also got started.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.720]   So I'm just trying to fill the gaps that I think
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.560]   exist.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.400]   We have already.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.320]   - It's something I learned.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.480]   Something I learned in my 20s is, yeah,
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   that which you've obviously already discovered,
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.880]   is that those embarrassingly stupid questions
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.440]   are the questions that lots and lots of people want to ask,
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.280]   but they assume everybody already knows.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.360]   And so they end up never getting asked
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.920]   and everybody's like, we really don't know.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.040]   So, speaking personally,
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.600]   when somebody asks me those questions,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.880]   I'm always very grateful.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.160]   Because I'm always like, ah, that's a good point.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   I had, you know, like,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.800]   particularly if you're an expert on something,
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.960]   you don't really think to mention it
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.680]   until somebody asks you the question.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:53.640]   - Yeah, I've been super blessed that people have been
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.680]   so nice and they always share their knowledge
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.280]   like they've shared it privately with me.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.080]   And also like now on the podcast,
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:37:59.920]   they've been sharing it.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.240]   So I'm super lucky in that way.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.480]   - Have there been things that have surprised you either
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.000]   that have been very popular that you didn't expect
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.600]   or some things that you thought like,
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.120]   oh, this is gonna be big
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.480]   and they didn't really go anywhere?
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.560]   - Honestly, I started with the arrogance of like 20 year old,
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.080]   hey, people will listen to this.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.040]   I know this is awesome.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.480]   Everyone should listen to this.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.360]   This will be the number one data science podcast
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.480]   in next year.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.440]   No one listened to it.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.640]   And then I realized as I got a bit more mature
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.160]   that it's super hard to get people to click on
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.480]   and our long video on YouTube alongside with everything else
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.120]   that exists on there,
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.920]   especially stuff that's like super technical,
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.760]   super knowledge heavy.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.160]   Now I feel super grateful that people,
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.280]   thousands of people listen to the podcast.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.320]   They click download, they click on YouTube.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.360]   So now I feel like.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.120]   - Yeah, and I think people are like,
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.360]   I think it's under appreciated how much people
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.000]   do want that kind of content.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.640]   Like, you know, you look at something like
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.640]   Lex Friedman's podcast and it's not flashy,
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.920]   you know, like it's well produced
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.400]   in that Lex spends time on like,
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.120]   he has high quality equipment and he sets it up carefully
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.280]   and he does it in person.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.240]   But you know, his actual interviews is just like
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.520]   him asking questions, generally fairly brief questions
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.320]   to somebody who's generally highly technical
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.640]   listening to the whole answer,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.560]   rinse and repeat for one and a half hours.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.120]   And it's, you know, lots of people do actually end up
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.200]   tuning in because they're, you know, not everybody,
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.240]   but there are people out there who want
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.960]   high quality, not dumbed down content.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:48.160]   - I remember watching your interview on his podcast
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.720]   and I thought, no, you'll say yes to me.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.800]   And when I said I want to fill the missing gaps,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.760]   that's what I meant.
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.600]   Whenever I do a podcast, for your case,
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.320]   I listen to every single interview,
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.400]   every single email you've done.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.680]   And then I would ask the questions that weren't discussed
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.360]   there, so just try to bring those things out
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.840]   and not always start with the repetitive questions
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.360]   that many people do.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   - That's a great point because Lex does that too, you know.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:23.000]   And I don't do many interviews at all.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.400]   Like I did one with Lucas, you know,
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.000]   who runs Wets and Biases, I did one with Lex.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I mean, hardly anything else.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.640]   Like, and in both cases, Lex and Lucas like,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.960]   just had done their homework so well.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.360]   And so the questions they asked were genuinely interesting.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.440]   And so to the kinds of people who are interested
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.200]   in my thoughts in Korea, it's gonna be interesting to them
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.240]   because it's just, it's not just like, oh, who are you?
[00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.080]   What do you do?
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.440]   It's like, oh, do this thing called fast AI.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.520]   And, you know, anybody who knows me
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.800]   doesn't wanna hear more about just like, what's fast AI?
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.880]   They know what's fast AI.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.560]   So, you know, what you're describing,
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.400]   it's how everybody should do it, but hardly anybody does.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.720]   (laughs)
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.840]   And, you know, probably a lot better for you as well, right?
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.480]   'Cause in the process of doing that research,
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.240]   you're gonna learn about stuff.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.080]   - I personally feel maybe it's because of my culture
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:23.880]   and upbringing, it's also insultive to the other person
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.040]   to ask like very basic questions.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.320]   Like if I interview you and ask, hey, Jeremy,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.640]   can you please introduce yourself?
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.680]   I won't do that.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.720]   That's my job.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:35.960]   I should be asking the interesting questions to you
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.360]   and to anyone that I--
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.520]   - I think it's insulting in our culture too,
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.960]   but people still do it.
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.040]   (laughs)
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.960]   Anyway, good on you.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.640]   I mean, something I do wanna ask about,
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   which I definitely remember is the excitement
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.640]   that you shared about having the opportunity
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   to interview for a residency at Google.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.040]   And I think, you know, the community was excited for you
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.880]   as well, 'cause it's like, wow, you know,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.520]   good stuff, Sanyam, this is gonna be great.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.600]   And then it didn't happen.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.080]   You know, tell us a bit about that.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.560]   Like, what did it feel like?
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.960]   Like, how did you get that offer, you know,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.960]   to interview for Google?
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.240]   What did you do to prepare, you know,
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   what did it feel like to fail at that, you know,
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.480]   at that journey?
[00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.560]   And how did you, you know, push on from there?
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.600]   And what did you do with that experience?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.040]   - I was crying at 2 a.m. when I got the email
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.880]   that I had rejected.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.040]   - Yeah.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.160]   - And I used the word fail very intentionally, right?
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.560]   'Cause that's what it is, and that's what it feels like.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.640]   And it's like, okay, I've worked this, I failed, you know?
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.640]   And that's like, you know, let's not use bullshit words
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.800]   about whatever it's like when we fail.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.600]   How do you, yeah, how does it feel?
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.440]   How do you get up?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:14.000]   So you, I bet you were crying middle of the night.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.440]   Probably felt like that's it, right?
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.240]   You tried so hard to get here, it didn't work.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.080]   You're not good enough.
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.640]   Is that kind of the feeling you're having in your head?
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.080]   - Yeah, and the point I was getting to was also
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.960]   that I was again so distant to my peers.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.160]   I remember telling my friends,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.680]   hey, I interviewed at Google AI residency
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.080]   and they feel me.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.440]   And they just say, cool, okay, you'll get it next time.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.360]   Like they couldn't appreciate how big of a thing it was.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.560]   - Yeah, that's hard, yeah.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.080]   - And that's why I'm really grateful
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.640]   to FASTA community when I shared that, hey, I'd failed
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:50.240]   and I've done bad for the community
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.280]   because I couldn't get through.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.840]   Everyone was like super supportive.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.000]   That instantly got me to getting back.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.040]   And in fact, that's how I started the podcast.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.400]   I decided, okay, now I'm going to help the community
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.440]   to at least get to the point of interviewing
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   and hopefully someone gets through.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.720]   - Fantastic, so, you know, that's, I mean,
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.520]   I'm sure there's a lot of genuinely important outcomes,
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.080]   but how did you get there in the first place?
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.320]   You know, like you say, you come from a community
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   where nobody even knows what you're doing,
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.680]   let alone gives a shit about it.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.600]   How did you find yourself flying to America, to Google?
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.400]   - I just, I found this courage through applying
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.160]   through FASTA, I didn't expect to get into the course even.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.520]   And since then, I've just found the courage constantly
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.800]   to seamlessly apply, seamlessly ask for help.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.760]   So just stepping out of my comfort zone.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.080]   I'm very inherently shy, I've been shy all my life,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.280]   but now on the internet, I'm less shy
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.160]   and I just apply to every position.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.200]   Even in my undergrad, I would start applying to positions
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.640]   that I knew were clearly out of my league.
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.240]   And my goal was to just get to the interviewer
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.280]   and ask them, hey, how do I like actually get
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.120]   through this interview?
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.680]   And I never got a clear response at that time,
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.400]   but I just got to the extent where I could comfortably apply
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.640]   to things I didn't expect to go through.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   - And every time you do that, you know,
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.400]   there's a chance you'll fail, right?
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.720]   And so, but if you don't apply, then you always fail.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.360]   So, yeah, I mean, I'm the same.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.240]   I am introverted and shy.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.440]   And I remember telling my friend, Chris Latner,
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:30.440]   that a few months ago, and he was just like, sorry?
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.000]   I was like, I am.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.680]   And he's like, that can't be true.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.080]   He was like, here's all the things you do.
[00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   I was like, I know, and they're all terrifying.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.160]   And after it, I'm exhausted and I do it anyway.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:51.720]   Yeah, you know, you have to put do it anyway, don't you?
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.520]   You know, 'cause otherwise you'll always fail
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.080]   because you never give yourself the chance to succeed.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.040]   - Yeah, and just staying at it,
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.400]   I think I'd agreeing to the fact that initially I,
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.880]   of course, at that time didn't believe
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.920]   that I can't get a job just because I was
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.640]   so arrogant in my head.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.080]   Here, I'm ahead of my classmates.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.360]   Of course, I should get a job.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.280]   India is a big country.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.440]   It's very populated.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.080]   There's a huge amount of competition here.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.920]   So I, of course, wouldn't get the jobs.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.320]   And I would continue in my arrogance somewhat
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.640]   in my tenacity to continue talking to people,
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.280]   continue applying left and right.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.720]   - Yeah, so, okay, so you started the podcast
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.800]   and, you know, what happened?
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.880]   What was the next commercial opportunity you got
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:50.480]   and how did you make that happen?
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.600]   - I started it inspired by you
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.760]   where I decided not to monetize it,
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.200]   which wasn't the best decision
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.760]   because I was investing my money
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.840]   and not getting any returns.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.560]   My parents were definitely upset.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.680]   - Sorry.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.520]   (laughing)
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.040]   - No, but I didn't mean it in that way.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.720]   So initially, I started the podcast
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.640]   and then someone at H2O, H2O AI,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.320]   it's an awesome company, shared my podcast internally.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.960]   They were like, this guy's interviewing everyone.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.760]   I want to interview people at our company,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.040]   but he's interviewing them before I do.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.560]   That made the CEO reach out to me.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.600]   The CEO of H2O decided I want to hire this guy.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.080]   And then I got it to do as part of my day job.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.560]   - And he's another Indian guy, right?
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.160]   If I remember correctly.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.000]   - Yes.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.440]   - Yeah, cool.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.480]   - Instantly, that's how the dots connected.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.720]   And through any job I have had,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.200]   this is I think the fourth stint in my career.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.400]   It's always been through the FASTA community
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.160]   directly or indirectly, I feel.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:58.360]   - Yeah, no, I mean, that's actually amazingly kind of direct
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.480]   is like your personal branding.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.920]   I mean, not that unusual though, you know,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.120]   your personal branding efforts was the thing
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.520]   that made people not only know who you are,
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:11.120]   but you know, that you're doing something that's so good,
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.400]   like that's literally what they were wanting
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.440]   to do themselves.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.840]   That's amazing.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.240]   Okay, I have reached the end of my questions.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.280]   Did you have anything either that we haven't covered
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.880]   you'd like to cover, or is there anything
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:30.280]   that you would like to ask me before we wrap up
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.440]   the inaugural coffee time data science episode?
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.240]   - I would ask you for advice.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.640]   What do you, as my guru and my teacher,
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.840]   what do you expect me to do next?
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.120]   What do you want me to do next
[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.560]   that'll help make you happy?
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.920]   - Oh no, I never have opinions, you know?
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.360]   I try to like, I try to kind of say like,
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.280]   here's how you can move in a direction
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.840]   that you want to head, you know?
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.280]   Like, I don't have any sense of like what direction
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.080]   should anybody head.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.640]   I mean, hopefully, in a direction
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.000]   that's at least not destructive to society,
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.040]   and that you've got the tools and thought processes
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.440]   in place to think about how to help society.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.840]   But like, you're, I mean, you're doing exactly
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.760]   what I would have thought makes perfect sense,
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.120]   which is to surround yourself with not just good people,
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:24.200]   but people who appreciate you and value you
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.040]   for who you are and what you do.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.320]   You know, and particularly,
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:35.400]   you know, in a geography where that isn't gonna happen
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.960]   just by virtue of the people who happen
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.880]   to live down the street, you know?
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.960]   You know, the only thing I kind of tell people
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:48.480]   of around your age is you could consider
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.280]   changing your geography at least for a year or two.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.860]   Like, for me personally,
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.000]   one of the few regrets I have in my life
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.760]   is that I didn't do that.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.400]   You know, growing up in Melbourne,
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.840]   very different to India, but in some ways,
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.280]   you know, it's got some similarities
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.720]   in that it's a long way away from,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.840]   you know, at least kind of culturally
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.200]   and in Australia's case geographically
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.880]   from anything like the kind of stuff
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.280]   that I was interested in.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:23.780]   And nobody in my life cared about anything
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:24.880]   that I was interested in.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.760]   And that made me feel
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:32.440]   like there was something wrong with me.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:36.400]   You know, like I was weird and that was a problem.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.400]   And, you know, people would sometimes fairly directly
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.440]   give me that feedback, you know?
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.640]   - That sounds very similar to my experience also.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.420]   - Yeah, so going to San Francisco to me,
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.560]   like there's a lot of things I don't love
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.740]   about the US in general in San Francisco
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.000]   in particular, but it was such a confidence building exercise
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   to be surrounded by people who were interested
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.080]   in what I did and did try to do similar things themselves.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:13.320]   And to also realize that the people that I admired
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   and looked up to were not on some other level of existence.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.960]   They went on some other plane, but they would,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.560]   you know, they made mistakes and had setbacks
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:29.560]   and redoubled their efforts and just normal people, you know?
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:34.880]   And so I kind of thought like, okay, I'm, yeah,
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.200]   they're just other people like me
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.920]   and I can do interesting things like they're doing.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:42.920]   And like I'd always wanted to do interesting things
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.360]   like they were doing, I guess.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.040]   So that'd be the one thing like to consider.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.800]   And I'd say like a couple of years
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   in a invigorating culture full of people
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:03.480]   that respect the kind of work you do can be of value.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:07.600]   It's not possible for everybody, you know?
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.500]   And honestly, it wasn't really possible for me
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.360]   for most of my life.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.920]   So it's not really a regret in that it wasn't something
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.500]   that I had access to or something I wish I had access to.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.600]   And it's definitely not needed.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.700]   Like you can totally do it all, as you've shown online.
[00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:30.460]   But yeah, it's something to consider if it's an option.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.460]   - Thank you.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.920]   Now I've gotten to the stage where it's somewhat possible.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.120]   I'll try to explore that option.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.800]   But before we wrap up,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.800]   I also want to really thank you for all the knowledge
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.120]   you've been sharing with the community.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.960]   Your interview will always be pinned on my channel.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:51.800]   This is the 150th episode on the podcast,
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.720]   but I'll always be grateful to you and the community.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:58.120]   All of my small achievements are through Fast Day,
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.480]   so thank you so much for-
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.260]   - It's actually the first episode of Coffee Time Data Science,
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.260]   but I know what you mean.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:10.260]   Well, we'll let you keep it as the 150th.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.360]   You're more than welcome.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.920]   And thank you, because I mean,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.560]   you've given back so much to the community.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.480]   So I know so many people are grateful to you.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.040]   So thank you.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:25.680]   - They've been too kind, just to add one more thing.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.120]   I know I have a lot to learn still.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.120]   I've gone off on this tangent of creating content,
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.460]   and I feel like an imposter
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.320]   that is only a discussion's grandmaster,
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.520]   is only a competition expert,
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.720]   and that knowledge needs to transfer somehow.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.280]   So I know I have a lot to learn still,
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.640]   and the imposter syndrome is taking over, but I'll-
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.040]   - Wow, you're still young.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.880]   You'll get there.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   Thank you, mate.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.160]   Have a great day.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.000]   - Thank you so much, David.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:53.840]   - Bye.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
