[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   I work on the robotics team at OpenAI. We use Weights and Biases with continuous
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.520]   integration a lot. It's extremely important to see that your model don't
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.200]   regress. You know, it gives you a kind of sense of the pulse of the team, of how
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.360]   quickly you're moving and so on. But it's also an extremely good way of just having
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.840]   full transparency in the work that you're doing with other people. We have
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.360]   like 10 to 20 people working with our code base, so at any point in time
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.280]   somebody could commit a change that breaks something. It's a very transparent
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.840]   way of seeing how much your utilization is of your resources. Like, do you use 10%
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.640]   or 90% of your CPU or GPU? And you know, we want to be at as close to 100%
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.040]   as possible. So it's been a very, very useful tool for us for just like saving
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.720]   money. And you know, you can call out to your friend like, "Why are you only
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.680]   using 10% of the GPU? You can be running 10 times as many experiments." What has
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.760]   changed now is that since we have like a common place where all our results are, I
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.640]   can take the results of my colleague Lillian, for example, I can take whatever
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.240]   she has trained and I can compare that with what I trained. We can create a
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.520]   quick report with that. I can download the model that she had trained. I can go
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.560]   in and look at other metrics very easily since I have all the raw data. It's
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.440]   reduced a lot of the overhead in communication to make us really focus on
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.360]   the communication that really matters about like, what should we work on
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   and what are the most important things now rather than like, what did your
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.760]   results look like two weeks ago? That's a waste of time. In some ways, it's kind of
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.240]   like a shared logbook for the team of our progress.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.820]   (gentle music)
[00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.400]   (gentle music)
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.460]   you
