[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.560]   This book has generated a lot of controversy. I thought it would, it's probably generated more controversy than I anticipated. It has certainly generated more different sorts of experiences than I had anticipated. So for instance, I did not think that writing this book would

[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.180]   A teacher is teaching, for instance, the Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.

[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   an opinion editorial piece for the local newspaper. But every year,
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:43.920]   There's not been one case that has come to my attention in which it was even remotely sensible for the teacher to be disciplined. And what I say is that, number one, frankly, I go through, what I write is almost a synopsis of my book. Number one, this is an important word in American history.

[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:44.260]   assistance to racial minorities. Now, the reaching out has, can happen in different ways. A light form of affirmative action might be reaching out in terms of recruiting, making a special effort to make sure that young people, let's say, in racial minority neighborhoods know about your college. You know,
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:26:14.280]   and it's a very, very good way to make sure that young people know about your college. You know,
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:14.280]   We're going to be doing a lot of work in terms of recruiting, making a special effort to make sure that young people, let's say,

[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:23.740]   Can you make the case for affirmative action and can you make the case against it?
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:30.740]   Yeah, I can make the case for and I can make the case against the case for I won't spend much time on this.
[02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:31.640]   Like I said, there's there's

[02:33:47.000 --> 02:34:05.340]  Å‚ych are being challenged. Most people think, including me, that the Supreme Court of the United States is going to limit, if not totally seek to abolish affirmative action. So this is a very burning issue.
[02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:16.820]   As things currently stand, my university and other universities embrace affirmative action.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:46.680]   I think there's a little something to that with respect to some subjects. I don't think that's what's really going on for the most part. I mean, if that's what's really going on, why don't we just do it?
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:46.680]   I think there's a little something to that with respect to some subjects. I don't think that's what's really going on for the most part. I mean, if that's what's really going on, why don't we just do it?

[02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:46.720]   didnt want to be a part of the process of making the video. So, I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good belief. I associate myself with the belief. It's just that because of the legal rules, the authorities can't say this belief out loud. But it's still the case that a lot of institutions want to help American society overcome its racial past. That's the real animating force. Now, this thing is not just about the belief. It's about the belief that we have to be a part of the process of making the video.
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:46.720]   That's the real animating force. Now, this thing is not just about the belief that we have to be a part of the process of making the video. That's the real animating force. Now, this thing is not just about the belief that we have to be a part of the process of making the video. That's the real animating force. Now, this thing
[02:35:46.740 --> 02:36:16.740]   you know, we'll have better classroom discussions. You know, some discussions. I mean, you know, with some subjects. Yeah, listen, I'm, you know, I'm an ignoramus when it comes to physics. My sense of it is, however, that if you're talking about physics, you're talking about physics, and frankly, it doesn't much matter in terms of mastering physics, what the demographics of that classroom are. You either know physics or you don't.
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:16.740]   Well,
[02:36:16.740 --> 02:36:16.740]   Well,
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:27.000]  our

[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:57.180]   and,ï¿½, this kind of narrow shallow definition of diversity still matters.
[02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:02.060]   Okay, well you know I think I think I think you've made a good point and
[02:37:02.060 --> 02:37:10.520]   maybe so so let's go back to the physics I mean let's suppose that under one scenario
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:14.180]   there's a classroom and a kid sticks his head in a
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:42.900]  .
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   You know, I think that's a good point.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   You know, I think that's a good point.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   you know, I think that's a good point.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   You know, I think that's a good point.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   you know, I think that's a good point.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.900]   So, you know, to that extent I can see you know, under that scenario maybe it does matter.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:42.920]   So, you know, to that extent I can see you know, under that scenario maybe it does matter.
