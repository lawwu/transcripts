[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   Let's imagine you have a black rapper
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.840]   who invites people on stage,
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.960]   and let's suppose they invite a black person on stage,
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.560]   and they're perfectly happy when the black person
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.200]   is full out with their lyrics.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.080]   They invite a white person on stage.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.720]   The white person is sort of mystified,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.200]   but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.560]   including the infamous N-word,
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.760]   and then the black rapper gets mad.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.880]   Imagine the white comedian who satirizes that,
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.480]   pokes fun at that,
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.080]   and in poking fun at that, says the infamous N-word.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.040]   Am I angry?
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.800]   No, I'm not angry.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.700]   Not angry at all.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.680]   The following is a conversation with Randall Kennedy,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.520]   professor at Harvard Law School
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.720]   and author of many seminal books on race,
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.560]   law, history, culture, and politics,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.360]   including specifically on affirmative action,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.640]   criminal justice, policing,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.320]   and the topic explored extensively in this conversation,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.160]   the single most powerful word and slur
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.840]   in the English language, the N-word,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.000]   with a hard R at the end.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.040]   Randall has written a book with this word as the title,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.920]   N-word, the strange career of a troublesome word.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.480]   Please be warned that Randall uses this word
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   throughout this conversation deliberately and skillfully
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.640]   to discuss its power and its role
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.200]   in the history of the United States.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.620]   I don't intend to shy away
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.040]   from controversial topics like these,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.720]   and I'll work hard to handle them thoughtfully and thoroughly
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.240]   with respect and with empathy,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.640]   often with several guests
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   who have very different perspectives on the topic.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   In the end, I believe in the power
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.120]   of long-form conversations to heal divides
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800]   by furthering understanding of human nature,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.160]   of human history,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   and the full diversity of the human experience.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.880]   This is "Alex Friedman Podcast."

[00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.080]   in the description.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.500]   And now, dear friends, here's Randall Kennedy.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.200]   You wrote a book whose title is "The N-Word,"
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.640]   spelled out with a hard R at the end.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.680]   So let's start with the history of this word.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.900]   What is the history of the N-word?
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.160]   - The word you're referring to is "nigger."
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.320]   The book that you're referring to is
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.440]   "Nigger, the Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.600]   The word dates back to the 16th, 17th century.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.640]   It's got a long lineage, in other words.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.760]   Basically Latin, basically Spanish,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   basically N-I-G, you know, black in various formulations.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   We don't know actually how the term nigger became a slur.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.340]   So there were words that were close to N-I-G-G-E-R
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.000]   that were used in various ways.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   For instance, N-I-G-G-U-H was used.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.700]   N-I-G-G-U-R was used.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.100]   And sometimes it was used in a way that seemed to be
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.420]   just purely descriptive.
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.740]   We do know that by the early 19th century,
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.540]   it had become a slur.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.060]   It had become a derogatory word
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.420]   about which people complained.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.140]   But exactly how that came about, not altogether clear.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.300]   - So it's been 20 years since you've written the book.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.080]   What wisdom have you gained about this word
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.540]   since writing the book?
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.860]   And maybe having to interact with people,
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.300]   having to read, having to see,
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.220]   having to feel the response to the book.
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.860]   - This book has generated a lot of controversy.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.220]   I thought it would.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.300]   It's probably generated more controversy
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.340]   than I had anticipated.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.820]   It has certainly generated more,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.100]   more different sorts of experiences than I had anticipated.
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.100]   So for instance, I did not think that writing this book
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.380]   would prompt people to ask me
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.780]   to be an expert witness in cases.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.500]   And over the past 20 years,
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.580]   I've been an expert witness in a number of different cases.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.580]   I've been an expert witness in a murder case,
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.000]   in various cases of assault.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I've been an expert witness in cases involving tort cases,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.580]   intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.780]   I've been an expert witness
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.480]   in a number of employment cases.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.040]   I had not anticipated that,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.340]   nor had I anticipated the extent to which
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.340]   people would get in trouble for using my book.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.660]   Every year, there are teachers who are suspended
[00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.300]   or who are fired because they will excerpt
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.940]   a chapter of my book.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.140]   Let's imagine, and this is not,
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.700]   I'm not imagining things as this happened.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.780]   A teacher is teaching, for instance,
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.960]   the Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.240]   The word nigger appears in that book over 200 times.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.320]   The teacher, trying to be earnest,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.900]   trying to be sensible, trying to be serious,
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.100]   will excerpt a part of my book
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.420]   to acquaint students with the history of the word
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.580]   and maybe the history of controversy
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.000]   involving the use of the word in this particular novel.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.220]   The teacher will give it out,
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.080]   hand it out to the teachers, hand it out to students,
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.140]   and there have been a number of teachers
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.720]   who've been suspended or worse because of that.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.140]   Students will get upset, go home, tell their parents.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.980]   Their parents will storm to the school
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.820]   and say that this is terrible.
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.020]   The teacher is, quote, "using the word nigger"
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.540]   in an offensive way, and oftentimes,
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.540]   administrators will basically abandon the teacher.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.600]   Whenever this comes to my attention,
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.580]   I write, I'll write the superintendent of schools
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.900]   or I'll write the principal,
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.540]   or sometimes I'll write an opinion editorial piece
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.580]   for the local newspaper, but every year,
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.580]   there are teachers who are disciplined for using my book.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.760]   I had not anticipated that.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.300]   - And what is the nature of the letter or the op-ed
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.100]   that you write on why they shouldn't be disciplined
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.780]   or to the degree they should be or shouldn't be?
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.100]   - There's not been one case,
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.100]   there's not been one case that has come to my attention
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   in which it was even remotely sensible
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.460]   for the teacher to be disciplined.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.900]   And what I say is that, number one,
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.420]   frankly, I go through, what I write
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.140]   is almost a synopsis of my book.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   Number one, this is an important word in American history.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.060]   It is a word that is explosive,
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.700]   that's why people get so upset.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.340]   It's a word that's volatile,
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.340]   it's a word that has typically been used in a terrible way.
[00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.300]   It's a word that is part of the soundtrack
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.260]   of racial terrorism in the United States.
[00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.460]   So people ought to know about this word.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.460]   I mean, if you're interested in knowing the real history
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.480]   of the United States,
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.620]   if you're interested in knowing about lynching,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.700]   if you're interested in knowing about the way
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.740]   in which black people have been terrorized
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.460]   in the United States, you need to know this word.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.680]   You need to know that history.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.180]   So you need to know why it is
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.620]   that people are upset about the word,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.160]   but it doesn't end there.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.860]   You have to know that, and if you know that,
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   then that knowledge should equip you to be careful.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:46.360]   It should equip you to know that,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.420]   to know the range of context in which this word appears.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.540]   But again, it doesn't just end there,
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.240]   because especially young people,
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.620]   you tell that to young people,
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.160]   they nod, they read, they understand that.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.940]   But then, but then what?
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.260]   But then they turn on their radios and they turn on,
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.700]   they listen to Spotify,
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.220]   they listen to some of their favorite entertainers.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.540]   They listen to Dr. Dre, they listen to the Ghetto Boys,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.540]   they listen to Snoop,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   and they listen to NWA.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.060]   What do they hear?
[00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.740]   They listen to standup comedians.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.500]   They listen to Dave Chappelle.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.200]   They listen to Cat Williams.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.360]   They, you know, what do they hear?
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.180]   They hear the word nigger, or nigga,
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.800]   being used in a lot of different ways.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.660]   And so they need to know about that as well.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.060]   What are people doing?
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.580]   How does one explain the fact that Dick Gregory,
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.380]   Dick Gregory was a comedian, activist,
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.280]   friend of Martin Luther King Jr., a true activist.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.180]   I mean, he had a very,
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   he had a flourishing career as an entertainer
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.220]   that he abandons in order to struggle for racial justice
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.500]   throughout the United States and including the deep South.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.020]   How does one explain the fact that the,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.580]   he wrote several memoirs,
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.580]   but his first memoir is called "Nigger, a Memoir."
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.980]   How does one explain that?
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.940]   How does one explain the way in which,
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.180]   how does one explain Richard Pryor?
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.180]   I mean, Richard Pryor's best album is "That Nigger's Crazy."
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.220]   Well, was Richard Pryor trying to put down black people?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.820]   How does one explain that?
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.500]   One can only explain that by getting deeper into the word,
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.320]   by understanding that yes,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.660]   this is a word that has been used in a derogatory way.
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.540]   This is a word that has been used to put people down.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.100]   This is a word that has been used to terrorize people.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.940]   You gotta know that.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.460]   But you also have to know that this is a word
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.900]   that has also been put to other uses.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.620]   There are artists, there are entertainers
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.620]   who have used this word, like Dick Gregory used it,
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.420]   to put up a mirror to American society
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.900]   and say, "Look at this word
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.880]   "and look at the terrible way in which it's been used.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.000]   "We don't want you to look away.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.860]   "No, don't look away.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.560]   "We're not, no euphemism, no asterisk,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.240]   "no N-word, no, nigger.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.260]   "Now we want you to look at that
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.020]   "and we wanna talk about that."
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.320]   James Baldwin.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.900]   James Baldwin, there was a documentary
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.900]   about James Baldwin a couple of years ago,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.440]   highly lauded documentary.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.460]   The title that was given to this documentary was
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.260]   "I Am Not Your Negro."
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.760]   That's not what James Baldwin said.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   Anybody can go to YouTube right now, take a look.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.340]   James Baldwin said, "I am not your nigger."
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.920]   And then he went on to talk about that.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.500]   Well, James Baldwin wasn't, again,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.660]   he wasn't trying to cover up anything.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.980]   He wanted people to face the facts of American life.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.060]   And it seems to me that if you're a teacher
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.760]   and you want to have your students face the facts
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.140]   about American life, well,
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.860]   you've got to grapple with the word nigger.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.800]   Now let me just quickly say,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.120]   teachers have a tough job.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.040]   And if we're talking about students,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.500]   of course, there's a wide range of students.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.520]   Am I saying that one ought to give my book
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   to kindergartners?
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.800]   No, kindergartners are probably not ready for such a book.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.320]   Third graders, probably no, not third grade.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.880]   If we're talking, however, about people in the 10th grade,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.980]   do I think the 10th graders can read my book?
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.480]   Yeah, sure, absolutely.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.680]   11th graders, 12th graders, people in college,
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.660]   there are people in college.
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.580]   There are people in college.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.100]   There are people in law schools.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.440]   Teachers in law schools have been disciplined
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.720]   because the word nigger has come out of a teacher's mouth.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.680]   Why?
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.760]   In a couple of cases recently,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.440]   teacher would be reading a court opinion.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.120]   The word appears in the court opinion.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.500]   The teacher pronounces the word, ah.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.320]   Students get up, leave in a huff, report the teacher.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.720]   There's some instances in which teachers have been,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   under those circumstances, have been disciplined.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.000]   In my view, that's bad.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.160]   And people ought to say it's bad.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.100]   It's bad pedagogically.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.880]   And frankly, in many of these instances,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.600]   it's not only bad, it's stupid.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.920]   And I don't mind saying that.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.440]   I think that some of these instances
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.760]   in which teachers have been disciplined, absolutely stupid.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.080]   People say, well, the teacher used the word.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   Excuse me, used the word?
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.240]   It'd be one thing, it'd be one thing
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.420]   if a teacher looked at a student
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.120]   and called the student nigger.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.000]   Get out of here, nigger.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   That'd be fine.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.700]   Discipline, that's teacher, that's bad.
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.360]   But that's not what's going on.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.480]   You don't have, none of these are cases
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.960]   in which you have an individual
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.440]   who is a stranger to another individual
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.120]   and this word just sort of comes out.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.880]   No, what we have here is a class
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.160]   involving a person who is a teacher
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.800]   interacting with students,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.400]   talking about subjects in which
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.680]   it would be perfectly understandable
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.380]   why this word would emerge as a subject of conversation.
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.240]   Now, under those circumstances,
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.640]   it's somehow wrong for a teacher
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.680]   to utter this word.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.280]   In my view, the answer is no.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.320]   And I said that 20 years ago.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.060]   I say it even more emphatically now.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.560]   - Still, it is one of the most powerful words
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.480]   in the English language.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   And there's a kind of responsibility
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.200]   that we as humans should have with words,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.440]   with statements.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.800]   That word, if not used skillfully,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.480]   if not used competently,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.120]   even when just read from a legal transcript,
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.540]   can do more harm than good.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.640]   - I agree with what you say.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   Yes, words are powerful.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.160]   Words do matter.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.920]   And so I am certainly not suggesting
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.080]   that people be lax.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   I'm not suggesting that people be irresponsible.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.720]   It's precisely because words matter, however,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   that we need to be willing to face words
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.400]   and grapple with words and talk about words
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.240]   and talk about the history of words,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.000]   precisely because words matter.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.720]   And among other things, it seems to me,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.440]   it's important to understand
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.360]   that words can mean different things in different contexts.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.800]   It's not the case that a word
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.880]   means the same thing in every context.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.020]   The word discriminating.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.820]   Sometimes it's a very bad thing.
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.840]   That person discriminates.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.360]   And when you, again, intonation of voice means something.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.520]   If I say, "That person discriminates,"
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.720]   and I'm obviously being disapproving,
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.880]   implicitly what I'm saying is that person
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:42.280]   distinguishes between things on an unjustifiable basis,
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.360]   and that's a bad thing.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.080]   On the other hand, that person has discriminating taste.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.720]   Oh, that means something very different.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.080]   That means that the person differentiates
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.200]   in a way that shows that they understand
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.820]   the difference between excellent, good,
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.640]   and not so good, and we think that that's a good thing.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.760]   So words can have different,
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.920]   words can mean different things in different contexts,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.620]   and it seems to me that that's something
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.440]   that actually we ought to recognize.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   We ought to recognize and talk about.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.760]   - Well, some words enter this territory of being a slur,
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.640]   and it seems like when they cross the line
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   into being a slur, there's the number of contexts
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.540]   in which it's okay to mention it
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.780]   exponentially decreases, right?
[00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.460]   - No, no, I'm gonna resist that a little bit,
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:47.460]   because the whole idea of slurs, slurs change.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:53.180]   Yankee was a slur.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.040]   Yankee was a slur in 18th century United States.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.920]   Slur today, New York Yankees, I'm a Yankee fan,
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.400]   I'm a Yankee.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.560]   Queer, queer.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.440]   This is in my lifetime, there was a time,
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.520]   you queer, and people would really run away from it,
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.380]   and that was a bad thing.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.380]   And then, thank goodness, gay liberation movement,
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.740]   gay liberation movement, basically,
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.080]   we're not gonna run away from this.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.900]   We're gonna grab this, quote, slur,
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.020]   and we're going to affix it to ourselves,
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.300]   and we are going to repurpose it.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.820]   Now, the word queer is, again, can it be a slur?
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.140]   Yeah, it can be a slur, doesn't have to be,
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.340]   and it seems to me that it's important for people
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.340]   to know about how a word, a symbol,
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:06.600]   in some contexts can be a slur,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.300]   in some contexts doesn't have to be.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.100]   So the whole idea of what's a slur,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:18.620]   that's a complicated idea in and of itself.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.460]   It's very complicated.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   It's, if I may say, almost fascinating how language evolves.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.060]   But if we were to kind of have a minute-by-minute
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.980]   evaluation of the most powerful,
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:37.300]   intensely slur-like words in the world,
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.380]   I think the N-word with a hard R at the end,
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.140]   which is the title of your book,
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.900]   is number one on that list.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.140]   - Well, probably so, and of course,
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.900]   that's one of the reasons why I wrote a little book about it.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.220]   - Yeah, but it hasn't, even since you wrote
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.180]   a little book about it, it seems like it's maintained
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.540]   its number one status.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.020]   You mentioned queer.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:05.020]   Maybe queer was in the top 20, I don't know, for a while,
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.660]   and now it's sliding into the top 1,000,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.140]   and the N-word is at the top.
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.220]   - You're absolutely right.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   The origins of this book, I clearly remember.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.460]   I was at my office, and I was thinking about lecture topics,
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.260]   and I get invited to give lectures from time to time.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.300]   And I was thinking, well, what might make
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.380]   for an interesting lecture?
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.220]   And all of a sudden, the word nigger popped into my mind.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.620]   Now, this is a word, I've grown up with this word.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.780]   I mean, there's never been a time in my life when,
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:49.060]   at least in my conscious life,
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.660]   in which this word's been absent.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.660]   I mean, in my household, for instance.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.940]   In my household, my parents are black people.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.620]   My parents were refugees from the Jim Crow South.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.900]   I was born in the Deep South, South Carolina.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.580]   In my household, I heard the word nigger used
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.540]   in every possible way.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.140]   I heard it used as a slur.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.540]   I also heard it used with respect to people
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.460]   who were praised.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:29.620]   My father, I clearly remember my father, whom I revere.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.980]   That's the smartest nigger in the world.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.100]   That's the bravest nigger in the world.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.420]   That's the baddest nigger I know.
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.540]   He wasn't putting people down.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.940]   This is the way he talked.
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.780]   And I grew up hearing this word in various ways.
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.220]   And so I was thinking to myself,
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.900]   God, where did this word come from?
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.260]   And one of the first things I did,
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.900]   I clearly remember just jumping up out of my seat,
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.460]   running up to the library, Oxford English Dictionary.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.020]   When did this word first appear in English?
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.460]   What was the history of the word?
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.820]   And then what really sort of grabbed my attention
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:13.700]   is I get my computer going,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:19.300]   and I asked the computer system,
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.220]   give me every case,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.340]   every federal court case in which this word appears,
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.060]   thousands of cases.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.980]   And then I said, oh my goodness, this is really interesting.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.980]   And then I started just cataloging all the different cases.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.380]   There came a point, I'd say probably about a month into this,
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:52.860]   I compared the number of times nigger came up
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.540]   with other sorts of slurs.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.140]   So for instance, kike, K-I-K-E,
[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.140]   long time derogatory word for Jews.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.660]   How many times has this word come up?
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.860]   There was a time in which the word appeared,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   but nothing like the infamous n-word, nothing.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.660]   And then what about wetback?
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.940]   What about, and then I just,
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.220]   let me just take a look at all the other slurs.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.220]   Nothing came close, not even remotely close to nigger.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.500]   And I think it has something to do with,
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   I think it has something to do with the uniqueness
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.260]   of the color line,
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.740]   particularly as it pertains to African-Americans.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.580]   I think that the fact that nigger
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   sort of occupies such a unique status among slurs,
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:59.900]   I think that's a reflection of the unique stigma
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.340]   that has been imposed on African-Americans.
[00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.020]   - It's hard to know the chicken or the egg
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:13.140]   why one word is able to so distinctly and clearly
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.300]   encapsulate this struggle between races
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.980]   that is throughout American history.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.660]   I mean, they didn't have to probably be so,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.500]   but it came to be that way.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.220]   - It became that, and not only that,
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.760]   not only that, but of course,
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.540]   the nigger spurred other slurs.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.840]   So Arabs, sand niggers.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:42.120]   The Irish, the niggers of Europe.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.540]   Women, the niggers of the world.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.060]   - John Lennon even has a song.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.660]   - That's right.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.260]   Well, I think Yoko Ono, I think,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.260]   had something to do with that song.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:58.260]   So, I mean, it is a slur that has spawned other slurs.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.660]   And again, this is, that's why,
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.020]   as you indicated a moment ago,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.960]   this is a quite unique term.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.500]   - But are you conscious,
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.220]   are you deliberate in you saying this word?
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.180]   So let me just say from a personal experience,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.580]   maybe my upbringing, where I came from,
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.820]   in my daily life, I don't think I've ever heard
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.700]   that word with a hard R said as often,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.580]   used clearly in my life, said,
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.540]   I've heard it today more than I have ever heard
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.220]   in my entire life.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.220]   And I think there's a few people who listen to this,
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.540]   that will be listening to this
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.780]   and will be very uncomfortable.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.780]   I would say not in a bad way, probably in a good way.
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.380]   I'm uncomfortable now and I am almost introspecting
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.460]   and trying to figure out why am I uncomfortable.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.660]   And I think even the title of your book
[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.060]   is making me think that.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.860]   Just looking into my own mind and trying to understand,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.820]   wow, words have power.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.580]   And why does it have so much power?
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.460]   But are you deliberate in that action?
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.700]   And by the way, not only are the people listening
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.500]   to this sweating, this will be on YouTube in part.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.820]   And YouTube, the people on the other side will be sweating.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.540]   What do we do with this?
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.340]   - Yeah, well, am I deliberate?
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.220]   The answer is yes.
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.420]   And let me unpack that a little bit.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.980]   First, that's right.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.780]   I mean, am I deliberate?
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.940]   I deliberately wrote a book called
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.580]   "Nigger, The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.300]   And was that deliberate?
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.660]   Yeah, that was quite deliberate.
[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.300]   - But the title could have been N-word versus--
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.100]   - The title could have been N-word, sure.
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.380]   The title could have been N-word.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:02.060]   The title could have been a book about a word
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.660]   that causes pain to many people.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.020]   I could have named it that.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.740]   There are many titles I could have used.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:15.260]   Did I want a title that would be provocative?
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.260]   Did I want a title that would grab people?
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.220]   The answer to that is yes.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.380]   I'm a writer.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.860]   I want people to read what I write.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.540]   Was I being sensationalistic?
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   Well, I mean, if you wanna put it like that, yes.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.740]   I'm not embarrassed to say that.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.620]   I mean, I'm sure that when people write books,
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.260]   they think really hard about their titles
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.220]   and they try to get a title
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.740]   that will grab people's attention.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   I know people, respect people very deeply,
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.980]   who never, it's a matter of principle,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.260]   never utter this word.
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.660]   And I've talked with people, I've had people say,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.980]   I read your book, let's talk about it,
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.060]   but let's be very clear, I'm not gonna use the word.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.460]   I've had many conversations with people
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.420]   who've asked me not to use the word.
[00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.300]   I was on a, the first time this came up was a book tour.
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.420]   It was 20 years ago when the book first came out
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.100]   and I was on one of these call-in shows
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.820]   early in the morning.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.100]   Time came to call in, seven o'clock.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.180]   I call in at five or seven.
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.100]   Right before I go on, the host of the show says,
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   oh, by the way, we have a strict policy here at the station.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.140]   We never use this word.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.620]   And I said, well, gosh, I wish you had told me this earlier.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.860]   Does this mean then that you're never going to pronounce
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.100]   fully the title of my book?
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.620]   And she said, that's right.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.700]   And I had to make a choice right then and there.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.580]   Am I gonna go on or am I not?
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.420]   What'd you do?
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.500]   I went on and I abided by the station's rules.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.300]   And fine, we had a perfectly fine conversation.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.780]   And there is a place for euphemism.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.420]   The American language is a very supple language.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.860]   There are lots of words that one can use.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.860]   I do not get angry with people who don't,
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.420]   they say as a matter of principle,
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.860]   they're not gonna use the word, fine.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:34.900]   I'm willing to, I understand where they're coming from.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.740]   And often I will defer to their wishes.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.580]   All I say is, I want people to understand
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.780]   where I'm coming from.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.340]   I'm not just using this word willy nilly.
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.180]   There's a pedagogical reason.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.760]   There is a reason for why I'm saying what I'm saying.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   There is a reason why I use the word.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.100]   - Can you make the case why using the word is a good idea
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.980]   and can you make, can you steel man the case
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.340]   why it's a bad idea?
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.020]   Maybe you've heard from some critics.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.860]   - Yes.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.460]   - Who said that you saying this word out loud
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.940]   is actually causing a lot of harm.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.820]   Not like harm because people's feelings are hurt,
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.220]   but increasing the amount of racism and hate in the world.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.740]   - Yeah, critics.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.180]   Let's start with the critics.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   One, again, going back to when the book was first published,
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.540]   I remember going to, it was the first bookstore I went to.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.180]   And I talked about the book, had a very, you know,
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.860]   talked, asked questions.
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:43.580]   And the last comment, wasn't a question,
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:47.500]   but the last comment was made by an elderly black man.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:54.060]   I called on him and he said,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.140]   "I've listened to what you've had to say
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.640]   "and I appreciate what you've had to say."
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:03.000]   But he said, "But I remain unconvinced.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.920]   "And I remain unconvinced because when I was coming up,
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:15.620]   "this word was used to put me in the back of the bus.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.120]   "And this word was used to prevent me from voting.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.960]   "And this was the word that was used to justify me
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.000]   "never being called as a juror.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.080]   "So to me, this word has only one meaning.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.780]   "It's a terrible meaning.
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.260]   "I'm never going to use the word.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.560]   "It hurts me when I hear people use the word,
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.840]   "especially those who don't know anything about the,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.000]   "you know, really about the history of it."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.640]   And he went on to say, "I think that your book,
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.020]   "though well-intended, is probably going to be seen
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.880]   "by some people as giving them permission to use the word."
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.500]   And then he stopped.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.740]   And I thought that there was a lot of power
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.000]   behind that gentleman's comment.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.600]   I think that what he said is probably correct
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.680]   insofar as there are probably some people
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.840]   who read the book, there are probably some people
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.560]   who are listening to our conversation right now
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:30.760]   who will think that I'm giving people permission
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.140]   to use the word.
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:43.160]   You know, I have said that I'm not.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.980]   I want people to understand the word.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.600]   I think that there is a burden that comes from,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.800]   whenever you utter a word like this.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.920]   But that's a critique, and I think there's strength
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.760]   to that critique.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.880]   I'm not gonna say that that's a ridiculous critique.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.640]   I think that there is something to that.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.960]   And by the way, I should say, and that's why
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:12.120]   I would say to anyone, that's right,
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.780]   if this word comes out of your mouth,
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.440]   you are taking on real responsibility.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.600]   So for years, it doesn't happen so much now,
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.080]   but they were, I'd say for about the first five years
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.120]   after this book was published,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.120]   I would get an email at least once a week.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.420]   And it would begin like this.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.040]   You know, dear Professor Kennedy, I read your book
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.260]   and I'm calling to ask you a question.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.520]   And as soon as I saw that,
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.120]   I knew what the question was gonna be.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.400]   And what the person would say is the following.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.800]   I like rap.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   And then I knew what was coming.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.800]   I like rap, I'm white, and I have black friends
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.560]   and we listen to rap and we're driving in the car
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.800]   and we're listening to the song.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.760]   We start humming along and singing along.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.640]   And my black friends sing along.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.040]   And when nigger or nigga comes up, they sing,
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.440]   and I don't know what to do.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.520]   Is it wrong for me to sing along?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:27.400]   This happened so often that I'd say about after the,
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.080]   about the 10th time I got in such an email,
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.000]   I wrote a form letter.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.760]   'Cause I didn't wanna just, you know, take up time
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.800]   writing, you know, sort of crafting letter
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.620]   after letter after letter.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:40.460]   So I wrote a form letter.
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.060]   And basically what I said was, listen, number one,
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:45.920]   you know, I'm flattered that you're asking me,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.160]   but number one, you should have a conversation
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.320]   with your friend.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.920]   Number two, no matter what your friend says,
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.440]   let me put something else for you to consider.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.420]   Let's suppose for the sake of discussion
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.500]   that your friend says, oh, doesn't bother me.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.740]   I know where you're coming from.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.160]   We're just enjoying the music.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.680]   I don't think that this is a racist utterance,
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.840]   you know, coming out of your mouth.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.600]   Let's suppose that your friend says that.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.560]   That doesn't end matters because let's imagine
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.920]   the following, let's imagine that you're in a theater
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.900]   and you're waiting for the, you know, film to start.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.580]   And you're just, you know, talking with your friends
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.600]   or singing with your friends or just, you know,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.300]   kicking back with your friends.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.760]   And they're talking about nigger this or nigga this.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.860]   And you say it, you the white boy say it.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:52.200]   And the next thing you feel is a fist,
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   a big fist in your mouth that has been launched
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.360]   by a person that you did not see who was right behind you.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.880]   All this person saw was a white person saying nigga.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.200]   And the next thing, pow.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   That's not, you know, some sort of overheated scenario
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.600]   coming from some law professor's mind.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.320]   That is a very plausible scenario.
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.800]   So you have to be worried about lots of things,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.840]   including mistake.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   So my advice to you is be prudent.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.240]   I would stay clear of the word unless,
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.320]   unless you're very certain and unless
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.000]   if you're called on it, you feel you're in a position
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.800]   to defend yourself, defend what you're doing.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   But the prudent thing would be to stay clear.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.040]   - There's so many questions I wanna ask there.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.440]   One is about the violence and the legal aspect of that.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.520]   It's very interesting.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:55.880]   You raise that in the book.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.800]   But, you know, I do wanna bring up
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.460]   something I probably disagree with you on,
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.320]   which is you say that there's not a significant difference
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.960]   between the different variations of the N word.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.800]   The one, or maybe you don't.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.960]   I just listened to a bunch of your interviews.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   So there's the version with the ER at the end,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.160]   version with a GA at the end, and then GRO at the end.
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.000]   These are all different versions.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.640]   And I feel like in that list of powerful words,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.520]   you know, I feel like there's a distinction.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.400]   I feel that the number one spot is the one with the hard R.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   And I don't know, maybe you can try to shed light,
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:51.160]   but I feel like the one that ends in GA
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.320]   is really far down the list in terms of modern culture.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.720]   So this is, we talked about the evolution of the words
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.000]   and the word queer, for example.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.480]   It feels like, maybe because of rap, because of comedians,
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.640]   because it's become much more,
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.480]   it lost so much of its power.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.800]   - Well.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.640]   - Or you don't think so?
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.760]   - No, I think there's a difference
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.560]   between nigger and nigga.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.880]   I mean, people make a distinction between them.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.720]   And I think that to the extent that lots of people
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.120]   make a distinction between them,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.280]   I think, you know, just as a sociological fact,
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.240]   they are different.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.960]   I think that people who get upset,
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.720]   if somebody, especially white people.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.120]   So, you know, if a white person says nigga,
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.200]   and they're, you know, and they're, you know,
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.320]   sort of criticized about it and they say,
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.680]   "Well, I didn't say nigger.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.840]   I said nigga."
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.760]   Believe me, I think most people who are mad at them
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.440]   are gonna stay mad at them.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:59.160]   Now you raised the word, you know,
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.760]   so nigger and nigga, I would put
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:07.640]   in a very different category than negro.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.000]   - Educate me here.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.480]   - Well, yeah, sure.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.720]   I'm happy to.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:17.840]   Negro is a,
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.960]   also controversial.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.320]   It's also controversial.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.360]   But,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:32.120]   negro has never been viewed
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:35.640]   by a substantial number of people
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:41.080]   as a derogatory term, at least in the,
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.240]   with the same amount of animus, the same amount of,
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:51.880]   it's a very different kind of word than nigger or nigga.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.360]   I mean, after all, I mean, you know,
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.680]   negro, Martin Luther King Jr.,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:03.240]   all of his great oratory, negro.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.920]   You read the work of,
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.080]   the great W.E.B. Du Bois, negro.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:16.400]   You read the work of my boss.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.800]   For instance, I use the word negro.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.720]   I use African American, black, Afro-American,
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.920]   but I also use the word negro.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.280]   Now there are some people who get really mad at me
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.480]   because of, you know, when I use the word negro.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.600]   And so for instance, there's students
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.000]   who've gotten really quite exercised.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.760]   And they'll say, you know, I'll be giving a lecture
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.400]   and a hand will go up, I'll call on somebody
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.360]   and they'll say, listen, are you using the word negro
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.880]   in its purely because of the historical time period
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.720]   that you're using?
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.000]   So you, you know, is that why you're using it?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.380]   Or are you using it in your own voice?
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:02.600]   And often I'll say, well, I'm using it in my own voice.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.760]   And they'll say, well, I'm offended.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.280]   We think that this is, you know, that's old timey.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.660]   It's derogatory.
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:16.000]   When this first came up, I said, let's pause for a moment.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.360]   And I'll take that under advisement.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.640]   And let me look into this.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   And I ended up writing an essay about it,
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:29.480]   an essay about the history of the terms
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.060]   that black people have used to describe themselves.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:38.720]   And it's a long list, you know, black, colored,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.340]   Afro-American, African-American, negro, et cetera.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.160]   So I go through all that and I said,
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.880]   now, let me just tell you,
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   I know for certain when I started using the word negro
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:57.000]   often in writing.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.040]   I can date it.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.640]   1983, the summer of 1983 is when I started using
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   the word negro in my professional life as a lawyer.
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:15.160]   And I did it for a very specific reason.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   I did it because my boss demanded that I negro capital N.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.980]   Now, who was my boss?
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:31.880]   My boss in the summer of 1983 was Associate Justice
[00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.300]   of the United States Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall,
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:41.080]   known as Mr. Civil Rights.
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.840]   Now, it seems to me you're telling me
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.240]   that this word is so out of bounds,
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.600]   that this word is derogatory,
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.340]   nobody should ever use this word.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.280]   Does the fact that Thurgood Marshall demanded
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.560]   that I use this word,
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.400]   does that complicate things a little bit?
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.340]   And so I think that people, again, ought to know more.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:12.260]   I mean, I've encountered students who don't know very much,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   but who want to lecture me on word usage
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:24.400]   because they know three sentences about current fashion
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.560]   and hold it, hold it.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.560]   By the way, I push it further.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.880]   I sometimes use the word colored.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.480]   And then some people really don't like that.
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.420]   Colored, well, there's an organization
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   still very much alive in American life and law,
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.460]   the National Association for the Advancement
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:54.420]   of Colored People, the NAACP.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:58.720]   They haven't changed their name.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.960]   And as far as I'm concerned, it's a wonderful organization.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:07.220]   There are people who have used the word colored.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.880]   That's what my grandmother used, colored.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.260]   Perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.260]   So again, there are lots of different words
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.940]   that one can use.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.380]   You can use different formulations.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.360]   I understand that people have different preferences.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.880]   Fine, I have my preferences.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.440]   At least know where I'm coming from.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.040]   - Still, words have power and they have power to hurt.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.040]   And there's a lot of reasons that I could see
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.660]   to justify the use of the word in its full form,
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.120]   as you're saying, in this conversation as you're using it.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   One of them is perhaps fighting for the freedom
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.400]   to be able to use those kinds of words.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.600]   So let me ask you about the freedom of speech
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.840]   and the censorship of the word.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.920]   Should the use of the N word be censored,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.720]   for example, on social networks?
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.920]   - So we can come up with different places.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.840]   We can say university campuses, maybe in op-eds,
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.960]   or I don't know.
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.280]   But I think social networks currently
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.480]   is a very interesting place.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.080]   There's a lot of conversations that are happening on them.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:28.280]   There's the ability, the technical capability to sentence,
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.600]   to remove the ability of people to use the word.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.480]   Do you think they should be allowed to use the word
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.720]   on Twitter, for example?
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.120]   - My response is it all depends on the way
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.680]   in which the word is being used.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.000]   If the word is being used to intimidate,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.440]   if the word is being used to terrorize, then no.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:59.680]   Along with lots of other words, by the way.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.100]   I mean, you can have, I could use the word,
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.740]   I suppose, gentleman.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.320]   I mean, I'm sure that I could conjure up a way
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.760]   in which that word could be used in a intimidating way.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   So, would I be happy if there was a technology
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:25.840]   that always blanked this word, N-I-G-G-E-R?
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.040]   I would be against that.
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   For one thing, it would erase the name of one of my books.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.400]   And I think that the book actually has a lot
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:42.240]   of useful information, makes some useful points.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:47.160]   And by the way, let's imagine a world
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:51.840]   in which there was a technology that blanked
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.520]   every time N-I-G-G-E-R appeared.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   You would have, what would that do to novels
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:05.020]   by James Baldwin, by Toni Morrison,
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:09.900]   by, what would that do to the speeches
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.100]   of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr.?
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.820]   What would that do to the comedy albums
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.520]   of Richard Pryor, Cat Williams, Dave Chappelle?
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.940]   What would that, if one sort of plays that out,
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.220]   would one want to have all of those blanks
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:37.380]   in important literary and political performances?
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:45.300]   No, I don't want such blanks.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   What I want, I would want the word to be there
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.900]   and for people to understand how to deal with this word.
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.180]   And by the way, you've used the word hurt an awful lot.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.600]   So let's talk about hurt.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.060]   I think we need to be more careful
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.900]   with the way in which we deal with hurt
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:12.740]   because people can be justifiably hurt.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.500]   You can have justifiably hurt feelings.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:21.580]   And if somebody has justifiably hurt feelings,
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.020]   I then think that we should turn to the person
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:26.820]   who has hurt those feelings and say,
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:31.820]   you have acted wrongly because this person's feelings
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.980]   are justifiably hurt in relationship to what you've done.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:42.060]   On the other hand, there are people who have hurt feelings
[00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.760]   and frankly, it's unjustified.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:49.280]   So just imagine the following.
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.640]   Let's imagine that I give a talk
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.780]   about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.320]   And then let's imagine that a Ku Klux Klansman
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.560]   comes up to me after my talk and says,
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.480]   oh, you have now hurt my feelings.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.560]   What, am I supposed to apologize?
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.600]   Am I supposed to be regretful that my talk
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.860]   about the greatness of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.480]   has hurt the feelings of the Klansman?
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.600]   No, my response is gonna be,
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.200]   you need to reevaluate your feelings
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:31.200]   because actually your feeling of hurt is unjustified.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.520]   And no, there's no apology coming from me.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.960]   - But there's a kind of line, perhaps the gray area,
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.440]   and maybe the word hurt has been overused
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.560]   'cause if you try to avoid hurting
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:50.880]   a small fraction of society that is mentally weak
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.840]   in a way where everything hurts them,
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.520]   that's the wrong way to build a society.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.760]   But if we flip that upside down and say,
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.320]   trying to maximize the amount of love in the world,
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.560]   and think about decisions we make
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.680]   in terms of the language we use
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.800]   to try to maximize the amount of love,
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.040]   and not just short-term but long-term.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.920]   And that's where freedom of speech is very powerful
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.520]   because it's a short-term painful thing often,
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.620]   but long-term beneficial thing, just having freedom.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.860]   And so there's where the question of the N-word
[00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:24.040]   starts to come in.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:29.940]   How much, how do we think about its use on the internet,
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:35.180]   on college campuses, in a way that maximizes
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.020]   the amount of love and compassion
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.340]   and camaraderie in the world?
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.220]   - I think that's good.
[00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:44.220]   And I would associate myself with your vision,
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.860]   how can we maximize love?
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.040]   No, I love that, I think that's great.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.780]   So let's take that on.
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.340]   I doubt that the way of doing that
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.380]   is to
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:08.900]   erase the infamous N-word.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.780]   I doubt that the way of doing that
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.940]   is to say to people,
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:21.360]   we understand that your feelings are really hurt
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.100]   and we're gonna do all that we can
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:29.020]   to avoid this symbolic action,
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:31.420]   maybe this word or maybe this symbol.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.700]   We're gonna really, we're gonna do all that we can
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.700]   to suppress it so that we can have a more loving universe.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:40.740]   I doubt that that's the way to do it.
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.440]   I think a better way to do it,
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.300]   I think a better way to do it
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.820]   would be to fully educate people,
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.780]   including educate people such that,
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:57.220]   you see that over there?
[00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:01.720]   That is the uniform of the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:06.660]   I want you to be educated about the uniform
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:09.060]   of the Ku Klux Klan so that you can look at the uniform
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.020]   of the Ku Klux Klan and know what it's about.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.440]   You're not terrorized by it.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.740]   You're not immediately, you don't see it
[00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.760]   and sink to your knees and start wailing and crying.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.540]   You don't see it and say, oh, I'm traumatized.
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.200]   No, you don't do any of that.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.760]   You see it, you understand it.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.000]   If somebody asks you about it,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.600]   you're fully prepared to talk about it.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.280]   It seems to me that that attitude, that poise,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   that strength, that knowledge would be a better way
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.480]   of equipping us to have a more loving world.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.440]   And by the way, just so you know,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.920]   I would say that about the swastika.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.600]   I would say it about the infamous N-word.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:00.040]   I would say it about all of the things
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.120]   that we're talking about.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.840]   It would be better for people to be educated
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.520]   so that they are not traumatized.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:16.880]   - So do you, you know, the N-word should not be removed
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.800]   from "Huck Finn," "Adventures of Huck Finn"
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.960]   or from the works of James Baldwin and Tori Morrison?
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.120]   - Not at all.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.120]   In fact, it seems to me that the polarization
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.080]   of these great artists' literary work,
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:40.040]   as far as I'm concerned, highly objectionable.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.520]   Highly objectionable.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:45.720]   - When is it okay for a white man to say the N-word
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:46.800]   with a hard R?
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:53.480]   - Here we need to focus on the word say.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.440]   Is it ever okay for anyone, you know,
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:02.240]   black, white, pink, yellow, I don't care, red, orange,
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.960]   is it okay for anyone to use this word in a way
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.760]   to put down people, to terrorize people,
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.280]   to intimidate people?
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.480]   Answer, no.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.360]   And I'd say that black person.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.600]   I've seen, I mean, by the way,
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.040]   I've seen black people use this word
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.480]   to try to intimidate, put down other black people.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.400]   Bad.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.920]   So I'm against it with a black person,
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.120]   white person, doesn't matter.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.600]   On the other hand, on the other hand,
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.440]   imagine,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:44.480]   imagine a white person
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.280]   who is
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:54.400]   giving a lecture
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:59.120]   on the history of American racism.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.560]   A lecture on the history of American racism.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:07.760]   And in giving that lecture,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.880]   quotes
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.200]   the, you know,
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:20.280]   white racist politicians
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.880]   who until fairly recently in American life
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.000]   used the infamous N-word.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:31.280]   So imagine a white history professor
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:35.840]   giving a lecture about the history of American racism
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.000]   and says, "In 1948,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.080]   "this is what so-and-so
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.120]   "running for the presidency of the United States said."
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   And then quotes a paragraph or two
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:57.880]   in which the infamous N-word is featured.
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.920]   Is that bad?
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.800]   No, that's not bad.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.920]   No, that's not bad.
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.040]   Sounds like a perfectly good lecture.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.000]   And I'm glad that you put the infamous N-word in there
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.240]   so that we can see that as recently as 1948,
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.000]   people who were running for the presidency
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.320]   of the United States openly used the word.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   That does not bother me.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   I'll say this too.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   Now, you know, somebody says,
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:27.080]   "Well, you know, nice job, Kennedy,
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   "but you've limited it to over here.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.920]   "You've put it in an academic setting.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.840]   "What about other settings?"
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.400]   It does not bother me.
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.760]   Let's imagine somebody who's a comedian,
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.680]   a white comedian,
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:48.600]   who is satirizing
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:53.000]   word usage.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.200]   Let's imagine a white comedian
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.320]   who is satirizing our current practice
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:08.040]   and wants to poke fun at the way in which,
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:13.120]   you know, let's imagine you have a black rapper
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:16.920]   who invites people on stage.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.040]   And let's suppose they invite a black person on stage
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.640]   and they're perfectly happy when the black person
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.280]   full out with, you know, their lyrics.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.160]   They invite a white person on stage.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.240]   The white person is, you know, doesn't really,
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:33.800]   you know, sort of mystified,
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.320]   but it comes on stage and full out with what the rapper says,
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.640]   including the infamous N-word,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.840]   and then the black rapper gets mad.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.960]   Imagine the white comedian who satirizes that,
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.520]   pokes fun at that.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:53.120]   And in poking fun at that, says the infamous N-word.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.080]   Am I angry?
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.840]   No, I'm not angry.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.760]   Not angry at all.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.640]   - What if in the process of satirizing,
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.000]   that comedian is not very funny?
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.240]   - You say, "Bad joke, you were not funny."
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.400]   - Okay.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.800]   - I don't object to the use of the infamous N-word.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.880]   I just say, you know, "You're not very funny."
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.200]   - But because there's a line, when the joke is not funny,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:19.080]   it just seems like the comedy is used as a cover
[00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:20.680]   to actually say something hateful.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.000]   It's an interesting thing about comedy.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.120]   I feel like the funnier you are,
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.200]   the more you can get away with.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:29.040]   - Probably.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.080]   - And that's something to do with the thing we said earlier,
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.440]   which is when you use words that have power,
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.080]   you should do so with skill and competence,
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.120]   and the responsibility those words carry.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.440]   - Again, the cases that I'm most familiar with
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   are the cases involving teachers, professors, academic.
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.360]   And it is said sometimes, "Oh, why do I object?"
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:59.000]   I object, sometimes people say,
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.840]   because I suspect that this teacher
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.000]   just wanted to say the word,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.080]   and that all of this is a cover, a pretext.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.400]   Do I, in my sense, my sense of it is, no.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.040]   I don't think it's a pretext.
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.600]   If it's pretextual, that's bad.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.480]   But in my experience, I have not seen that.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.520]   I don't believe that that's what's going on.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.600]   - I agree with you on that,
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.520]   but sometimes I do see people
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.160]   that kind of have this flying towards the light,
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.160]   desire to say something controversial and edgy,
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.360]   and they don't realize that there's a responsibility there.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.480]   There's a skill.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.800]   You shouldn't just say,
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.040]   I mean, actually, when comedians first start out,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.800]   they'll sometimes go into that territory.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:50.320]   They'll say edgy stuff that's totally not funny,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.480]   and then you realize this is not,
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.200]   like, the edgier the thing,
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.920]   the more skills required to really serve.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   Like, if you're cooking, as a chef, a poisonous fish,
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.520]   there's a responsibility on how to cook the damn thing
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.280]   so you don't poison the people eating it.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.620]   - I would agree, but to get back to your question,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.760]   let's imagine that somebody produces a new set
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.040]   of Lenny Bruce albums.
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.600]   So Lenny Bruce was white.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.120]   Lenny Bruce used the term nigger in his sets.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:27.960]   - Sure did.
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   - Question, would I want Lenny Bruce's albums now
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:39.840]   to be purged of the infamous N-word?
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.280]   My response, absolutely not.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.200]   - As another follow-on sort of question,
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.040]   what you think, I've seen interviews you've done
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.640]   about this particular book.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.360]   The title of those interviews on YouTube and elsewhere
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.440]   would use the full word.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.200]   What do you think about that?
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.980]   Should I use this word in the title?
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.780]   - In my view, the answer would be yes.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.600]   Again, there are people.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.040]   I've been on interviews.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.960]   I've been on stage with people
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.080]   who had a different conclusion.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:21.480]   I respect a different way.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:26.480]   Again, there is a place for euphemism.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.200]   Again, it all depends.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.840]   I'm not offended.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.320]   Let's imagine that you posted this
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.840]   and you had asterisks instead of spelling it out.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.600]   Would I be offended?
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.900]   No, I wouldn't be offended.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.580]   I would prefer the full spelling,
[01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.920]   but I would understand where you're coming from.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.760]   Would it offend me?
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.600]   No, it wouldn't offend me.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.960]   - Well, here's the weird calculation
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.320]   is which version of the word in the title,
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.880]   as silly as that is, brings more love to the world.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.120]   It's hard, and basically your answer is
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:05.960]   I don't know.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.100]   Your answer is you have to do it and find out.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.920]   - I'm not sure.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.360]   Again, there's certain questions in which,
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.600]   there's certain questions you're not gonna,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.560]   we're not really going to know.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.880]   There's no sociologist who's gonna be able to tell us that.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.040]   So what do we do then?
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   Then we go to secondary positions.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   And my secondary position is I don't know.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:45.520]   One thing that I hold onto, however, very strongly
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:49.960]   is the virtue of openness,
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.960]   the virtue of transparency, the virtue of freedom.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.160]   And I feel as though if I'm holding onto those things,
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.720]   if I'm trying to engage in a serious conversation
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.480]   in which I'm trying to make other people understand me
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.840]   and I'm listening carefully to other people,
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.660]   I feel at ease.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.320]   I feel at ease.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   I feel this is going to eventuate in something positive.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.120]   And I feel okay.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.080]   - You are at Harvard.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.600]   You're one of the most respected people
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.900]   in the history of Harvard.
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.520]   That said, you did write a book with the N-word in it,
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.640]   and you also have a lot of opinions
[01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.600]   that challenge the mainstream perspectives
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.120]   on race from all sides.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.500]   I'll hopefully get to talk about some of them.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:52.160]   But what's your view on Harvard
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.840]   and universities in general and speech?
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.400]   Did you feel pressure from any direction on,
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.040]   first of all, the title of this book,
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.520]   the content of the book,
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.640]   and in general, your views on race?
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640]   - Yeah.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   I am very laudatory of Harvard University.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.680]   I've been at Harvard since 1984.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.680]   I think it is a wonderful place to work.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   I have, in the various positions I've taken,
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:37.000]   particularly with respect to this book
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.760]   or all my other books,
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.440]   what has Harvard University done?
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.920]   Harvard University has done nothing
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   but provide support, sustenance, encouragement.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:56.360]   I think that people get down on Harvard University.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.320]   I would say to anybody, imagine the following.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:05.240]   Imagine that the ethos of Harvard University
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   became the governing ethos of the United States overnight.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.640]   Tomorrow, we would wake up
[01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.820]   in a much better United States of America.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:25.640]   I've been supported by Harvard University.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.560]   I think well of Harvard University.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.700]   That's not to say that I don't have criticisms of it,
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   but by and large, Harvard University,
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.440]   more than by and large, overwhelmingly,
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.100]   it has provided me,
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.600]   and I think it overwhelmingly provides my colleagues
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   with a work setting in which they can do their work
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:54.800]   without fear, and that's a good thing.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.640]   Are there certain aspects of Harvard University
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.840]   about which I'm critical?
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.660]   Yeah, sure.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.800]   - By the way, I think a few people,
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.560]   rightfully, wrongfully, would disagree with you
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.560]   that if the ethos of Harvard University
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.120]   took over the country, it'd be a better place,
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   but there's a lot of interesting ways to break that down
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.360]   'cause Harvard, there's not one ethos.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.480]   There's a lot of things going on that are very interesting.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.480]   But one of the things that's happening
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.000]   is the disproportionate and kind of aggressive growth
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.800]   of the administration versus faculty and students.
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.200]   I think the power of university
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.960]   should always be with the faculty and the students.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.880]   That's where the beauty is.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.940]   That's where the flourishing happens.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.840]   And the more you have kind of rules and bureaucracy
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.800]   and all this kind of stuff,
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.260]   the less powerful the university is.
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.260]   - I think that at my university and at many universities,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.480]   that's right, there's too much bureaucracy,
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.320]   too much regulation.
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:00.600]   And are there dangers to freedom of expression
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:07.680]   at my university and at other universities?
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.080]   Answer, yeah, there are.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:10.920]   There are.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.280]   And this has really hit home for me.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.880]   There was a period of time in which I was getting off
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.280]   of, I had gotten off of all boards.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.640]   I was just doing my work.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.000]   Forget it, I'm just gonna do my work.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.560]   I'm not gonna be associated with any organizations.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.880]   In the last five years, that has changed quite dramatically.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   I have gotten on various, I've reassociated myself
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:40.800]   with various organizations,
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.560]   mainly organizations involving academic freedom
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   because of what's going on on university campuses.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:58.520]   Again, I have been, at least thus far, thus far,
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:04.200]   this hasn't pinched me where I live, but--
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.480]   - You mean in the space of ideas?
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.000]   - In the space of ideas, in the space of speech,
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   in the face of teaching, I haven't been pinched.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.400]   But I am concerned about things.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.360]   So for instance, let's imagine that you're applying
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.920]   for a job, you wanna be an assistant professor.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.360]   Or let's suppose that you're seeking a promotion.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.120]   On many university campuses, you are asked to give
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:37.320]   a DEI statement in which you say,
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:43.440]   I plan to, one of the reasons why you should hire me
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.520]   or one of the reasons why you should promote me
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   is because I'm going to advance the DEI ambitions.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.480]   - Diversity, equity, and inclusion, for people who don't know,
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.600]   this is the general set of programs
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.680]   that most universities now have.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.560]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.560]   So you've got a sort of, basically,
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.840]   what you're being asked to do,
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.480]   whether they say it explicitly or not,
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.920]   they don't say this explicitly,
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.880]   but this is what is up.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.440]   What you're being asked to do is to say,
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:29.440]   I'm down with the diversity, equity, and inclusion ethos,
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.720]   program, policy, campaign.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.760]   And here's what I've done that shows
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.200]   that I'm down with this program.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.560]   And therefore, I'm okay.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.400]   Well, a lot of what I do would fit
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.760]   very comfortably within that.
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.520]   But let's suppose that I didn't,
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.720]   just suppose I didn't like this.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.320]   And by the way, there's certain aspects of the DEI industry
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.160]   that I don't like.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.880]   You mean to tell me that I'm being judged
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.600]   at an academic institution?
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.200]   Let's suppose I wanna be a chemist.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.720]   Let's suppose I wanna be a physicist.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.640]   Let's suppose I wanna be, I don't care,
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:17.000]   a critic of literature.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.640]   I oppose this program.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.160]   I don't think this is the way
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.720]   in which higher education should be going.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.120]   Should I have to, on pain of relinquishing
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.200]   my ability to be hired,
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.240]   should I have to sign onto this?
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.560]   Just suppose, and let's change it around.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.760]   Let's not make it a DEI campaign.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.640]   Let's make it a Make America Great Again campaign.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.680]   What would we think then?
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.720]   Let's suppose it was something that said,
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.960]   instead of it saying DEI,
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.320]   let's make it say,
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.040]   the advancement of American capitalism as we know it.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.840]   We want you to be down with that.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.960]   What have you done that shows us
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.760]   that you believe in the advancement
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.240]   of capitalism in America?
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.920]   Would I be happy about, no, I would say this is, no.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.920]   Well, no with respect to these, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.440]   with the DEI statements.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.600]   Oh, here's another one.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.480]   I just learned, and in fact,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.000]   I mean, there's certain things that are happening,
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.160]   and I must say, I mean, I'm in academia,
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.400]   but it's news to me.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.120]   I didn't know until relatively recently
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.040]   about positionality statements.
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.880]   So these are statements in which somebody writes an article.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.720]   Let's suppose, I write an article,
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:00.720]   and it's not enough for me just to submit my article
[01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:07.920]   to some law review or to some other sort of journal.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.480]   No, in addition to me submitting my article,
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.080]   I've got to give a positionality statement
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.800]   in which I say whether I am gay or straight
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.200]   or what have you, in which I say my race,
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.880]   in which I say my nationality,
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.360]   in which I say my stance
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.280]   toward this ideological position
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:35.080]   or that ideological position.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.800]   Interesting.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.600]   What?
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.840]   Is this becoming a kind of a standard?
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.440]   I don't know how widespread it is.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.240]   I know there was a very good article
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.960]   in the New York Times a couple of days ago
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.720]   about these positionality statements,
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.000]   and in fact, that's what sort of tipped me off.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.360]   Somebody had told me there's a law review
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.920]   at my home institution,
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.760]   and I had a friend who sort of mentioned this offhandedly
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   and who said, "Well, I submitted an article to this journal,
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.920]   "and I was a little bit taken aback
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   "in so far as they did have me fill out a questionnaire
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:23.760]   "in which I was required to state my race,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.360]   "state this, state that, state the other."
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:34.280]   And as far as I'm concerned,
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.040]   well, what does that have to do
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.040]   with a proper assessment of somebody's work?
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.020]   This concerns me.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.720]   I'm concerned about the fact,
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.500]   a little while ago, you mentioned,
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.580]   a little while ago, you mentioned the word Negro.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:07.440]   I was talking with colleagues a couple months ago,
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.480]   and somebody mentioned that this word
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.000]   had come up in their class,
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.840]   because what happened was one student
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   was reading from a Supreme Court decision,
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.640]   and the word Negro was part of what they read out,
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.680]   and another student held up his hand
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.700]   and said to the student who was reading,
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.220]   "Hey, you should be careful,
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:40.220]   "because I find the word Negro offensive,
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:45.680]   "and you need to be careful about even saying a word
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.400]   "that would be offensive to someone."
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.600]   And this person, and then the teacher was,
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.480]   "What should I say in those circumstances?
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.920]   "What should I have said?"
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.040]   And I volunteered, and I said,
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.440]   "Well, guys, that's really interesting,
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.200]   "'cause see, if that had come up in my class,
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.860]   "I would have said, well, frankly,
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.500]   "I don't even see what the big deal is,
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.160]   "'cause I use the word Negro."
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   And Harvard University is not on some level
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.160]   that is apart from everything else
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:27.840]   that's happening in the world.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.360]   If these things are happening in other places,
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.840]   if they're happening at Stanford,
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.880]   if they're happening at Yale,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.520]   if they're happening at Columbia,
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:38.260]   they're gonna happen at Harvard.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:45.040]   But thus far, and I am most especially experienced
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:50.040]   in life at Harvard Law School,
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:55.820]   Harvard Law School is an open environment
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   in which ideas are tested, and they are tested fully.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:09.360]   And it's because of that that I say
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.000]   I have been fully supported at Harvard Law School,
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.380]   feel that it is an excellent place in which to do work.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.260]   I'm a fan, I am a fan, and I'm not embarrassed to say it.
[01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:27.260]   I am a fan of my workplace, Harvard Law School.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:32.960]   I'm very happy to be associated with Harvard Law School.
[01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:36.700]   - Zooming out, in general in education,
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:39.540]   there's something called critical race theory.
[01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:42.140]   Can you comment on what are your thoughts
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:47.140]   about this kind of perspective on race and race in America
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.700]   to the degree that it's becoming a part
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.740]   of the education program?
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:55.460]   - Okay, so the first thing I wanna say--
[01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.580]   - What is it?
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:58.620]   - Well, the first thing I wanna say
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.380]   about critical race theory is that critical race theory
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:06.820]   has become a term, so I'm gonna put quotation marks
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.240]   around the term critical race theory.
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.060]   In a minute, I'll talk about critical race theory
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.180]   without quotation marks, but to begin with,
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.900]   I wanna talk about critical race theory
[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.740]   because the reason why people are talking
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.300]   about critical race theory so much now
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:26.740]   is because politicians, mainly Republican
[01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:32.900]   right-wing politicians, have created a boogeyman
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.760]   critical race theory with quotation marks around it.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:44.960]   They have created a boogeyman, and they have tried
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.160]   to make it seem as though this boogeyman
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:54.160]   believes all sorts of ideas that Americans should loathe
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.600]   and that Americans should fear.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.520]   And they've created this boogeyman,
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.200]   and they've created it, and they've done a very good job
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:07.000]   of creating the boogeyman, and they have mobilized
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   sufficient public support such that there are a number
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.400]   of states that have passed laws prohibiting the teaching
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:22.600]   of so-called critical race theory.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.300]   Now, the first thing I wanna say about this
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:30.300]   is that this campaign, these laws, these various policies,
[01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:34.880]   telling teachers don't teach this and don't teach that,
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:38.960]   and you can't use this book, you can't use that book.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   This is a frightening encroachment on freedom,
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.360]   freedom of speech, freedom to learn, freedom to listen,
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.560]   freedom to read.
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:56.360]   That's terrible, and it's one of the most frightening things
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:59.600]   that has happened in American life in recent memory.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.240]   So that's the first thing I wanna say
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.520]   about so-called critical race theory.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.760]   Now, now I'll say something.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.480]   I'm gonna take the quotation marks off
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.880]   of the term critical race theory.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.180]   Critical race theory is a sort of a,
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.220]   you could have a nice conversation
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:21.140]   about actually what it is.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.400]   One way of viewing it is to say that,
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:30.400]   well, critical race theory is a community of ideas
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:34.420]   that comes from a community of people.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:40.360]   The community of people would be people in legal academia
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:47.240]   in the period, 1908 starting,
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:52.420]   and probably the middle of the 1980s.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.240]   It would be associated with people like Derrick Bell.
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.200]   It would be associated with people like Kimberly Crenshaw,
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.920]   people like Charles Lawrence, people like Richard Delgado,
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.480]   people like Mary Matsuda,
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:11.220]   and these are folks who held,
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:15.120]   embraced a couple of,
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.280]   they articulated a couple of propositions.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.600]   One of their propositions was that
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:27.840]   liberal race policy was insufficient.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:35.600]   They would say that the racial policies
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:40.680]   of a person like my old boss, Thurgood Marshall,
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:45.800]   the liberal racial policies were insufficient
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:50.820]   to grapple fully with the pervasiveness
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:54.500]   and the depth and intensity of American racism.
[01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.120]   Their basic claim,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.560]   and I think by the way, it was a good claim.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:02.560]   Their basic claim was that American racism is more central,
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:07.200]   more deeply embedded in American life
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:12.200]   than most people perceived, including liberals.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.880]   And I think there was a lot of strength to that proposition.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:22.260]   But then they also took on some other propositions
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.880]   with which I was in very strong disagreement.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.440]   So I think it's perfectly fine to say
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.200]   that racism is a force in American life
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   that is deeper, more pervasive, more stubborn,
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.600]   more resilient than I think people often understand,
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.360]   often perceive.
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:51.360]   But then some of the folks in critical race theory
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.400]   push further.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.320]   One of the propositions that some of the people
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.080]   in critical race theory took was the proposition
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   that America was doomed to always be a country
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:16.680]   that would be governed according to the dictates
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:18.160]   of white supremacy.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.640]   Derrick Bell, who was a colleague of mine
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.260]   and a friend of mine, took that position.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.260]   He talked about the permanence of racism in American life.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:33.040]   And he took the position that the various changes
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.000]   that had been wrought in American life
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.840]   were really mainly cosmetic.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.640]   They didn't amount to a whole lot.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640]   I mean, Derrick Bell took the position,
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.920]   the second Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:52.160]   Well, yeah, it made changes, but at the end of the day,
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   black people were still, after the second Reconstruction,
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:03.260]   were still in a position of almost, I don't know,
[01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:08.120]   some of them would even say neo-slavery.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.720]   Well, I think that's ridiculous.
[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:13.780]   The second Reconstruction changed a lot.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.160]   And as for neo-slavery, neo-slavery,
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.520]   what are you talking about?
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.720]   A black American was president of the United States
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.740]   between the years 2008 and 2016.
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:30.240]   I mean, what are we talking about here?
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:34.600]   There's been a tremendous change,
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.560]   and I think people ought to understand that.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.600]   Now, am I saying that everything is peachy keen
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.440]   and all right?
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.820]   No, the United States is still,
[01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.340]   to a very large extent, still a pigmentocracy,
[01:24:51.340 --> 01:24:54.140]   but that doesn't mean that a lot hasn't changed.
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.740]   A lot has.
[01:24:55.740 --> 01:25:00.400]   So I disagree with certain tenets of critical race theory
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.980]   and have been very outspoken in my disagreement.
[01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:05.420]   There's another one, by the way, I need to mention,
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.020]   because we've talked so much in our discussion
[01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.460]   about freedom of speech, freedom to teach,
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.640]   freedom of listening.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:16.060]   Another big problem that I've had
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.300]   with some of the people who talk of themselves
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.260]   as critical race theory people
[01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:27.420]   has to do with their attitude towards freedom,
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.340]   freedom of speech.
[01:25:29.340 --> 01:25:31.940]   Some critical race theory people
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:35.900]   think that the American legal system
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.660]   is wrong in the latitude
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:43.880]   that it gives to what they call hate speech
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.340]   or the latitude that it gives
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.940]   to what they would view as racist beliefs.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.340]   Some of the people who associate themselves
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.260]   with critical race theory think that racist beliefs
[01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:01.900]   ought to be expunged with the aid of state power,
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:03.700]   if need be.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.660]   Well, I'm against that.
[01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.620]   And I think we are at a moment,
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   an ironic moment, in which actually it's the right wing
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:20.760]   that has embraced some of the ideas
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.600]   that were championed by some of the people
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.600]   who call themselves critical race theorists.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.600]   They say, "Oh, we ought to expunge hate speech."
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.480]   Well, the right wing is saying,
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.880]   "This critical race theory, that's hate speech,
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.000]   "so let's expunge it."
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   And so I, again, I've been very outspoken
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:48.020]   in my criticism of some of the illiberal dimensions
[01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:54.940]   of critical race theory.
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.980]   So I've been a critic of certain features
[01:26:57.980 --> 01:26:59.560]   of critical race theory.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.560]   I have applauded certain features of critical race theory.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.300]   Critical race theory, there's some aspects of it
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:10.400]   that I think have been useful.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.380]   There's some aspects of it that I think have been
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.040]   profoundly wrong-headed.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:17.280]   So that's where I am.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.120]   And I certainly, and above all,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:26.120]   I certainly am against any efforts to remove it
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.680]   from the intellectual universe.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.940]   It is a part of our intellectual universe.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.940]   People ought to know about it.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.720]   And people ought to debate it.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.840]   And people ought to be free to make up their minds
[01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.340]   to conclude what they will about the strengths
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:48.760]   and weaknesses of critical race theory.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.760]   - And we'll talk about the pessimistic
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.520]   and the optimistic perspective on race
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.320]   in the history of the 20th century in America.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.040]   I think you have very interesting perspectives there.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.680]   But before that, I'd love to look at the current moment
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.640]   and you had a conversation with Glenn Lowry
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.880]   and John McWhorter.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   And from there, it became clear to me,
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.920]   I think John made clear how important
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   the conversation about race is policing in today's society.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.640]   That that's where a lot of African-Americans feel
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:32.680]   is sort of the pinnacle of racism sits,
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.880]   the people that believe there's still racism in America.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.480]   There's still a lot of racism in America.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.820]   That's where it is.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:43.820]   So to what degree do you think
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:46.920]   there's widespread institutional racism in policing?
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:51.920]   - Yeah, well, my first book was a book
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.360]   called Race, Crime, and the Law.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.120]   - 1997.
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.780]   - 1997, wow.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.280]   - Time flies.
[01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.220]   - Time flies.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:10.320]   Unfortunately, unfortunately,
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:20.280]   the impetus behind that book stands.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:29.520]   That book was propelled by a sense that with respect
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.520]   to the administration of criminal justice,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.800]   African-Americans feel deeply aggrieved
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:50.540]   and they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:54.800]   And they feel deeply aggrieved with good reason
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.060]   in at least two dimensions.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:03.040]   On the one hand, African-Americans suffer
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:09.320]   from under protection.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.080]   And in fact, in that book, the central theme of that book
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.560]   was that black Americans suffer from under protection.
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.800]   If you take a look at the broad,
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.820]   sort of the broad trajectory of American history,
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:32.660]   and ask yourself, in what way have black Americans
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:38.960]   been most oppressed?
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:45.340]   Well, take a look at the antebellum period,
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:50.420]   period before the abolition of slavery.
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:53.880]   Before the abolition of slavery,
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.980]   in the locales where most black people resided,
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:00.820]   namely the slave states.
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:05.060]   In a lot of those areas, question,
[01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:10.060]   was there a crime called the murder of a black person?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:15.960]   Answer, for a long period, the answer was no.
[01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.620]   There might've been a tort, you know,
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:23.620]   of a white person killed the slave, killed a slave.
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:29.820]   That person could be sued because they had injured
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:36.180]   the property of another and would have to pay money
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:41.020]   for that, but had they committed a crime?
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.220]   Answer, no.
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:49.980]   In the antebellum period, were black women protected
[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:54.860]   against the crime of rape?
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:59.860]   In most states, the answer was no.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:02.160]   There was no such crime.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:08.900]   Let's go to after, you know, slavery is abolished.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:12.300]   Thank God, slavery is abolished.
[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:15.020]   Then let's see, you know, what happens?
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:19.020]   So we hear lynching, lynching.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:26.060]   From 1890 until, let's say, 1930.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:32.300]   Well, you know, in 1890, there was probably,
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.620]   you know, I would say there was probably, on average,
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.140]   a lynching every day in the United States,
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.420]   you know, well over 300 lynchings.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:44.300]   It goes down, that was the case in the 1890s,
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:47.140]   probably the first decade of the 20th century,
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.820]   and then it starts going down.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.140]   What was lynching about?
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.140]   Lynching was about black people being executed
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:01.660]   outside the law.
[01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:06.820]   Did the legal system do anything about that?
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:07.780]   Answer, no.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:13.140]   You know, show me, show me cases
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.140]   in which people were prosecuted criminally
[01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:20.180]   for engaging in lynching.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:24.740]   You come up, in most places, with a null set.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:30.660]   Black people suffered the underprotection of the law.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:33.660]   Do black people still suffer the underprotection of the law?
[01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.020]   The answer is yes.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:39.300]   And people talk about the Kerner Commission Report, 1968.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:43.580]   Black people were asked, you know,
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.460]   with respect to the police, what's your main complaint?
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.980]   In many places, the main complaint was,
[01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:54.100]   we don't have police protection.
[01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:58.700]   You know, when things happen to us,
[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:02.900]   when our houses are burgled,
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:09.180]   when our businesses are encroached upon by robbers,
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:13.220]   when our businesses are robbed,
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:18.380]   when we're assaulted, you know, nothing happens.
[01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:22.260]   The police protect white people, they don't protect us.
[01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.900]   Underprotection.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:31.660]   Our society right now, if you take a look at the statistics,
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:37.740]   who is most liable to be raped, robbed,
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:43.380]   the victim of assault, what have you?
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:46.900]   Black people.
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.300]   I mean, and it's not even close.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.900]   Underprotection.
[01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:56.180]   So that's one way in which the administration
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:59.900]   of criminal justice harms black people
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.220]   by not doing what government is supposed to do,
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:06.500]   which is protect us.
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:13.100]   14th Amendment, you know, equal protection,
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.980]   I underline protection of the law.
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.860]   So that was a big theme of race, crime, and the law.
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:22.300]   Now, second thing, second,
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:24.900]   and this is the thing that gets most attention,
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:27.100]   and it's important.
[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.140]   I think that the underprotection story
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.180]   does not get enough attention,
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.420]   but then there's a second story.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:37.420]   The second story is that black people have historically,
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:42.420]   and still today, black people are subjects
[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:44.780]   of invidious racial discrimination
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:49.780]   when it comes to police action.
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:54.860]   So, you know, walking down the street,
[01:35:54.860 --> 01:36:02.060]   walking down the street,
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:09.500]   you have a black person who's, let's say, 20 years old,
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:13.420]   you have a white person who's 20 years old,
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.020]   and let's make them men,
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.900]   both just walking down the street.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.500]   And the question,
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.220]   attitude of the police towards these two.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:27.580]   And attitude, you know, is a complicated thing.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.500]   It can show itself in various ways.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.020]   It can show itself in a look.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:36.420]   It can show itself in who gets the look.
[01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:40.420]   You know, black persons, you know,
[01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:42.980]   walking down the street or running down the street.
[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:45.260]   White persons walking down the street
[01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:46.620]   or running down the street.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.500]   What happens with respect to the police?
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:58.180]   Let's suppose that, you know, who gets the second look?
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:01.420]   Who is followed?
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:06.100]   Who is detained for a moment?
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   - Well, some of it, just on a small tangent,
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:12.220]   I apologize to interrupt,
[01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:14.140]   but attitude is an interesting one
[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.820]   because a lot of it, a lot of the interaction
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.220]   doesn't show up in the data.
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.540]   So detained, for example, starts showing up in the data.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.700]   But before then, the second look, the third look,
[01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:29.100]   the first look, this is where the gray area
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.220]   of conversation happens because--
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220]   - Very much so.
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.900]   - Culture and society happens in the stuff
[01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:37.620]   that doesn't often show up in the data.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.660]   - Yep, yep.
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:43.500]   So I tell ya, this really came home to me
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:46.300]   several years ago.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.220]   I was in New York City, and it was at a time
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:55.220]   when there was a lot of discussion over the--
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.620]   - Stop and frisk.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.500]   - Stop and frisk, basically, you know,
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.380]   racial profiling on the street.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:02.980]   I was walking, I was in Harlem,
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.900]   I'm walking down the street,
[01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:12.340]   and frankly, the police weren't bothering me.
[01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:14.020]   I'm just walking, no, no, no,
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.620]   police weren't bothering me, but you know,
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:16.940]   I'm of a certain age.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:23.060]   I did notice, though, I was looking at the police
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:29.100]   and the way that the police attitude,
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:32.740]   you know, had to do with body posture,
[01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.060]   it had to do with, that's right, who got a second look.
[01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.620]   It had to, I noticed, I'm walking in the street,
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.140]   I'm walking in Harlem,
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:44.140]   there are white people in the street,
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:47.100]   you know, most of the people, though, were black,
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:48.620]   some Hispanic.
[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:55.900]   The level of contempt, the level of animus,
[01:38:55.900 --> 01:39:03.380]   the level of unfriendliness that was pouring off,
[01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:06.940]   the cop, the police, they didn't say anything.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.220]   Nope, they didn't detain, they didn't say anything.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.420]   It was palpable.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:16.420]   I could feel the attitude that was being directed
[01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:21.220]   at the young black men.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:23.420]   And the thing is, see, the thing is,
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:27.020]   it's not as if this doesn't matter.
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:30.620]   It matters because the way I saw it,
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:33.460]   these young black men knew.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:38.460]   They felt the contempt that the police were shedding,
[01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:40.460]   and this was gonna have a consequence.
[01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:42.340]   The consequence it was gonna have is,
[01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:46.900]   let's imagine that the police did say, excuse me,
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:51.060]   you know, what are you up to?
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:55.180]   Now, if you have been feeling this contempt,
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:40:00.340]   if you feel like the officer who was asking this question
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.340]   doesn't like you, doesn't know anything about you,
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.460]   but just doesn't like you on sight,
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:10.820]   you might answer in a certain sort of way.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.140]   You're not going to give the cop the benefit of the doubt
[01:40:14.140 --> 01:40:16.380]   and basically think, well, you know,
[01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:18.700]   policeman's just asking me this,
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:22.740]   probably just trying to make the neighborhood safe.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:25.020]   Well, if that's your feeling,
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.220]   policeman's just asking me this,
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.860]   trying to make the neighborhood safe,
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:31.300]   well, officer, the reason why I'm here is such and such.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:35.340]   And, you know, thanks for your service.
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.900]   That's one response.
[01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.900]   Another response is,
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:44.980]   I'm not gonna tell you anything.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:48.540]   You know, I'm not gonna tell you anything.
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.860]   I know that you don't mean me any,
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:52.700]   I know that you don't mean me any good.
[01:40:52.700 --> 01:40:54.180]   I'm not gonna tell you anything.
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.460]   Am I free to leave?
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:00.260]   And then the cop, having heard that,
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.620]   then says something bad.
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:05.100]   You know, after five minutes, what do you have?
[01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.420]   You have an altercation on your hand.
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:13.060]   And I felt that, and that is part,
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:17.260]   and you're absolutely right, that's not written down.
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:18.940]   It doesn't get to court.
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:25.580]   It's there, but it's an important part of street life.
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:29.420]   It's an informal part of street life.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:33.860]   And it has ripple effects because that young black man
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.580]   will probably talk shit about that cop later that day,
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:38.980]   so the narrative persists,
[01:41:38.980 --> 01:41:42.460]   and then the cop will also talk shit,
[01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.540]   and then there's these narratives.
[01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:49.260]   And I think the contempt is such a powerful thing.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:51.820]   - It's so hard to disentangle,
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.620]   because you're absolutely right.
[01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:57.420]   The young man, let's suppose that the story ends,
[01:41:57.420 --> 01:41:59.020]   quote, well.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:03.940]   He's gonna go, and he's gonna be talking with his friends,
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:04.780]   and he's gonna say,
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.820]   "Let me tell you what just happened to me."
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.500]   And his friends are gonna say,
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.300]   "Oh yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.860]   "Let me tell you what happened to me."
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:16.620]   And for two hours, this goes on.
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:19.380]   The anger, the feeling of humiliation,
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:24.300]   the feeling of aggrievement grows.
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:30.220]   It's disseminated, and that's part of what we have.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:34.180]   But that's not all of, that's a important part
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:36.620]   of what we have, but we have, it's even worse than that,
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:38.660]   because then you ask the question,
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:44.500]   what about things we do know?
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:49.820]   I know this from my teaching.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.060]   This was brought up.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.700]   There was a lawsuit in New York City.
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.620]   And notice I didn't say Birmingham, Alabama.
[01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:03.260]   I didn't say Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:05.460]   I didn't say Tallahassee, Florida.
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.100]   I didn't say the Deep South.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:09.300]   I didn't say Montana.
[01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.740]   I didn't say Idaho.
[01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:15.740]   New York City, cosmopolitan place, metropolis.
[01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:22.540]   In New York City, the police were challenged
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.980]   with respect to their policies.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:30.100]   A judge wrote a very lengthy opinion,
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.620]   and the facts were rolled out,
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:34.180]   and the facts were really quite horrifying.
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.860]   People, there were black men who had been stopped
[01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.920]   many, many times, it wasn't just once,
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:47.260]   over and over and over again,
[01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:50.260]   under circumstances in which
[01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.580]   they ought not have been stopped.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:56.500]   And this has real consequences.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:58.580]   It doesn't just show up here, though, of course.
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:01.100]   It also shows up in other places
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.340]   with respect to the administration of justice.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:08.540]   And we still have a big problem.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.900]   Now, you mentioned the police.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:16.940]   If you ask yourself, who are the state agents
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.820]   that are most consequential?
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:28.180]   The police.
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.920]   I mean, you walking down the street,
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.920]   what other agents have guns on them?
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.780]   What other agents are authorized by the law
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:43.300]   to shoot you under certain circumstances?
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:44.180]   It's the police.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:49.180]   The police are the most consequential agents of the state
[01:44:49.180 --> 01:44:51.620]   that most people interact with.
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:54.220]   - I mean, to push back a little bit,
[01:44:54.220 --> 01:44:58.000]   of consequential in a physical sense,
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.380]   but if we return to the power
[01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:01.980]   of the psychological sense of contempt,
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:04.380]   I would say store clerks and stuff like that
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:05.380]   can also be a source of contempt.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:06.900]   - They're not agents of the state.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.580]   - Right, but if we look at the landscape of contempt,
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:12.380]   which throughout the 20th century,
[01:45:13.860 --> 01:45:15.420]   or the bus, right,
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:21.300]   you can experience the same kind of contempt
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.180]   in other aspects of society.
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:25.700]   But yes, the cops have consequences.
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:27.140]   - I would still put the police.
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:30.820]   The policeman or the police person
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:36.180]   is a person walking down the street with a gun.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:37.520]   - Gun, yeah.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.660]   - And if you think about the way in which the law,
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:47.500]   the extent to which the police are authorized
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:52.340]   to use their force,
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:55.700]   the police have extraordinary authority.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:04.540]   You know, you're driving your car and you're speeding.
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:09.580]   The police could arrest you right then and there
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.780]   and take you to jail.
[01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.580]   That's an extraordinary power.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:15.660]   - But they also have, because of that,
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:18.300]   the leverage, just one human to another,
[01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:20.100]   they have more leverage to be an asshole
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:21.540]   and to show contempt to you.
[01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:22.380]   - They certainly do.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.940]   - To be the lesser,
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:28.020]   to lean into the lesser aspects of their nature
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.340]   as all humans can,
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:31.100]   just to be an asshole, to show contempt.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:34.940]   You had a bad day, they have more freedom to do that.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.660]   - Yes, and that's why,
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:40.580]   that's why police officers
[01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:42.420]   are very important.
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.860]   I recognize, I mean, I know police officers.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:47.500]   They have a very difficult job,
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:52.340]   a very important job, very important.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:55.180]   Again, remember what I talked about under protection.
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:57.460]   I want the police to protect me.
[01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.980]   I want the police to protect me from the rapist, the robber.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:06.500]   So I, you know, the police, I'm with the police.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.860]   We need good policing.
[01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:13.700]   We, but we need good policing.
[01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.860]   And for good policing, we need accountability.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:18.700]   And one of the scandals,
[01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:23.220]   one of the just absolute scandals of American law
[01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:28.220]   is the extent to which the police are not held accountable.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:32.820]   It's absolutely remarkable the degree to which
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:37.820]   American law fails to properly hold police accountable.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:42.500]   They have an important job, a difficult job.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.660]   I want them to be very well paid.
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:47.980]   As far as I'm concerned, you know, we should be,
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:49.540]   police should make more money.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:55.580]   They should be, given the importance of what they do,
[01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:00.580]   they should have more respect, more prestige, more money.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:04.860]   With all of that, they should be held accountable.
[01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:09.460]   And the way things are now, they're not held accountable.
[01:48:09.460 --> 01:48:14.460]   And every day we see the consequences in our newspapers
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.300]   or just, you know, talking with people.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.220]   - So what do you make of the different perspective on this
[01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:24.740]   from, to bring up a person that I'll probably speak with,
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:29.740]   Heather McDonald, who wrote a book called "War on Cops,"
[01:48:29.740 --> 01:48:34.540]   and will often bring up the stuff
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.420]   that does show up in the data,
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:38.740]   to show the disproportionate amount of homicides
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:40.700]   committed by African Americans.
[01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:46.460]   And will also justify racial profiling on that basis
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.340]   in stop and frisk programs.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:51.900]   And will also bring up things like the Ferguson effect,
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:55.540]   saying that because of this pushback
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:01.100]   and all the stuff we've been saying about police,
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:04.820]   in those areas, the police will step back
[01:49:04.820 --> 01:49:06.140]   and crime will increase.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:09.060]   I was in one debate with her.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.060]   And one of the things that I said is,
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.220]   it was a debate that was sponsored
[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:18.940]   by the Federalist Society, conservative legal group.
[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:22.860]   You know, these were conservative law students
[01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.940]   at Harvard Law School.
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:28.780]   She made a presentation and they asked me to respond.
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:31.020]   And one of the things that I said was,
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.100]   when we're talking about the police,
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:39.940]   I'm disappointed with the reaction
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:49.140]   of some of my conservative colleagues.
[01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:50.140]   And I would consider her
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.580]   to be one of my conservative colleagues.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:56.820]   Because what are the sort of the,
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:01.820]   what are some of the important precepts
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:06.980]   of conservatives?
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:09.740]   One very important precept of conservatives,
[01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:13.780]   limited government, limited government.
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.860]   You know, conservatives talk about the tendency
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:20.580]   of government to overreach itself
[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:25.580]   and governmental agents to overreach themselves.
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:27.940]   And I say, you're right.
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.900]   You're right, right on.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.980]   Why is it that you somehow forget that
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:37.980]   when you're talking about the police?
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:40.740]   When you're talking about the police,
[01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:45.740]   you seem to be unaware of this tendency
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:50.700]   that is so much in your consciousness and other places.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:54.060]   But now when you're talking about the police,
[01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:55.820]   you make it seem as though I'm,
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:58.280]   you know, other people are being paranoid.
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:02.560]   When they talk about the danger of overreach,
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.840]   we need to be very careful about the danger of overreach.
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:08.760]   Another thing with respect to the police,
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:13.240]   what do conservatives, transparency in government.
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:16.280]   You're right.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.000]   You're absolutely right.
[01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.400]   We need transparency in government.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.880]   So why is it that so often
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:27.560]   when we're talking about policing,
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.560]   why is it that conservatives actually embrace police unions
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:39.120]   and are the enemies of transparency?
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:44.120]   Why is it that you want to prevent the citizenry
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.640]   from knowing that officer so-and-so has,
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.920]   you know, there've been 10 incidents in the last year
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:57.440]   in which citizens have complained about officer so-and-so.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:00.240]   Don't you think that the citizenry ought to know that?
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.080]   Why is it that you want to keep that under wraps?
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:09.080]   So overreach, transparency, the tendency,
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:14.220]   or the problem of governmental agent corruption.
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:20.440]   Why is it that those sorts of things
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.780]   are forgotten about when some conservatives,
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.560]   by the way, not all conservatives, not all conservatives.
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.920]   There's some conservatives who have stuck
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.600]   and appropriately so to their guns and have said,
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:44.600]   A, we need to make sure that the police stay in their lane.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.440]   We need to make sure that the police
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:53.280]   do not overstep constitutional bounds.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:56.720]   We need to be, we need to insist on transparency.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.280]   There are some conservatives who have taken that line
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:03.280]   and I salute them, but there are a lot of conservatives,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.960]   and I would say Heather MacDonald was one of them,
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:09.960]   who all of a sudden become just, you know,
[01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:13.400]   totally uncritical status
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.800]   when they're talking about the police.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:18.180]   - So the overstepping, overreach, the lack of transparency.
[01:53:18.180 --> 01:53:21.120]   Of course, we see this kind of stuff
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.880]   in foreign policy as well,
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.000]   which is starting military conflicts
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.880]   and a lot of the supporters, at least with Iraq
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:32.560]   and Afghanistan wars, were conservatives
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.400]   and hawks and so on.
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.680]   So there's a lot of hypocrisy
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:37.340]   in terms of principles and so on.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:41.960]   But maybe one question is,
[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:46.000]   in this discussion about racism and policing,
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.740]   there was a lot of cops that might listen to this
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.440]   and feel like they're not being,
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.680]   their profession's not being respected,
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.880]   they're not being heard,
[01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.960]   not being respected to the difficulty
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.640]   of the problem they're facing.
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.160]   - Can I just interrupt, Jack?
[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.040]   Remember a few moments ago,
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.400]   I mean, if I were in charge of things,
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:13.880]   if I were in charge of things,
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:18.640]   I'd pay police more, in fact, much more
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:21.040]   than they receive.
[01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.360]   I do, police have a very difficult job,
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.040]   extraordinarily difficult job.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:31.360]   I mean, for one thing, sort of maintaining the law.
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:35.200]   The law, that's a very complicated thing, the law.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.440]   That's not an easy thing.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.000]   I mean, I teach law.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.320]   I spend a lot of hours with very smart people
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.480]   trying to understand the law, very difficult.
[01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:52.760]   So here we expect people to understand the law
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.760]   at the same time that they are grappling with people,
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:00.200]   some of whom are violent.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.600]   It's very difficult.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.480]   I respect police officers,
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.680]   and I said, we need police officers.
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:09.880]   You did not hear me say, by the way,
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.400]   so let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:18.040]   You did not hear me say, defund the police, did you?
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.840]   In fact, to the contrary, I said, defund,
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:26.840]   actually, I want more funds for the police.
[01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:30.560]   I wanna hold them accountable.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:34.280]   I understand the difficulty of their job.
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.600]   I respect the police.
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.640]   I want people to respect the police.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:44.640]   I also want the police to respect civilians
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.000]   and demand that they do.
[01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:52.720]   I am not a police abolitionist, far from it, far from it.
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.600]   Again, we need good policing.
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:01.480]   For good policing, we need good people.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:07.120]   - To what degree, almost philosophically,
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:09.920]   maybe practically, do you think police
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.200]   should be doing racial profiling?
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:14.200]   Profiling in general.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.040]   - Okay.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:18.360]   - It's a very difficult philosophical,
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.960]   moral, human question.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.840]   - Yeah.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:24.520]   So, first thing we need to do,
[01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:28.120]   and here we get back to the early part of our conversation
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:32.880]   because we focused so much on, first part, a word.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.800]   Here we have another word, profiling.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.640]   Question, what is racial profiling?
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:44.200]   Now, here we have, in the weeds,
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:49.960]   we have people talking past one another.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:53.840]   I've been in conversations with police officers in debates
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:58.280]   and we talk past one another
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:02.160]   because we are defining racial profiling very differently.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:04.520]   If you ask, I've been in conversations
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.000]   with police officers and they say,
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.600]   "Oh, I'm totally against racial profiling."
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.560]   And then I say, "Well, sir, what do you mean
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:12.720]   by racial profiling?"
[01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:14.400]   And here's what they say.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:18.600]   Racial profiling is when police officers act
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.280]   against somebody wholly on the basis of race.
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.520]   That gets rid of the issue
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:32.400]   because most police officers don't act
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:37.640]   against anyone wholly on the basis of race.
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:40.920]   You could have the most racist police officer
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   and that police officer is not going to act adversely
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.320]   against the 90-year-old black woman
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.400]   walking down the street with a cane.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:59.520]   If you define racial profiling that way,
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:02.040]   you're getting rid of the issue.
[01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:05.480]   The issue is, the proper issue is this.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.440]   Should the police be able to act against someone
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:18.800]   taking race into account as a factor?
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.160]   So let's imagine that a black person who's 25 years old
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.840]   is walking down the street right next to a white person
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.280]   who's 25 years old.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.600]   Some people would say, "You know what?
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.800]   Under those circumstances,
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.120]   it's okay for the police officer
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:40.360]   to give two looks at the black person
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.680]   and only one look at the white person."
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:43.680]   Why?
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:48.680]   Because the statistics tell us that the black 25-year-old,
[01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:52.440]   there's much more risk of that person acting
[01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:53.720]   in an unlawful way.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.520]   If you take a look at crime statistics
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.840]   and ask the question
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:05.840]   with respect to homicide, with respect to robbery,
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.040]   with respect to various crimes,
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:16.920]   is there a difference between the white 25-year-old
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:18.680]   and the black 25-year-old?
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:20.560]   With respect to certain crimes,
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.880]   in certain places, the answer is,
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:23.560]   yeah, there is a difference.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.760]   And there is a greater risk
[01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:30.480]   that the black 25-year-old has engaged
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:33.400]   in various forms of criminality.
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:35.840]   I'm not, you know, that, okay.
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.280]   Under those circumstances, what do I say?
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.160]   Should the police officer therefore
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:46.640]   be allowed to take action vis-a-vis the black person
[01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:48.600]   as opposed, you know, as against the white person?
[01:59:48.600 --> 01:59:49.880]   My answer is no.
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:53.320]   I'm fully willing to concede.
[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:55.680]   Let's concede for the point of, you know,
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:59.760]   for the point of discussion that there is more risk.
[01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:01.400]   There might be.
[02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:02.280]   There might be.
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:08.360]   But for reasons of constructing the sort of society I want,
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:17.720]   we should not empower agents of the state
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:21.200]   to act towards certain people
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:27.200]   in a way that's, you know, adverse to them.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:31.440]   Let me try to break this down in a little different way.
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.480]   Let's go back to,
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:38.640]   let's talk about what happens
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:40.400]   when you wanna get on an airplane.
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.680]   You know, it wasn't so long,
[02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:44.960]   you know, 9/11 wasn't all that long ago.
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.280]   It was a while ago, but it wasn't all that long ago.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.040]   And this very issue came up
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.440]   with respect to the profiling of Muslims.
[02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:54.560]   And there were some people who said,
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:57.480]   well, geez, you know, in the aftermath of 9/11,
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.360]   profiling of Muslims makes sense.
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.880]   You know, no hard feelings,
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.000]   but, you know, the 11 people who, you know,
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.120]   were on those planes were all Muslims.
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:12.360]   Now, there is a rationale, you could just simply say.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:16.920]   It's not prejudice, it's not animus, it's not invidious.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:21.080]   It's just, you know, the facts take us this way.
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.080]   Well, the facts never take us this way.
[02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:26.880]   There are facts, and then there is our choice
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:29.760]   of how we want to respond to those facts.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:35.160]   Now, you could respond by saying,
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:40.160]   well, we perceive Muslims to be more likely
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:46.320]   to, you know, do bad things on an airliner.
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.380]   You could respond in that way.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:52.720]   On the other hand, you could say, no.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:57.720]   We want a society in which people do not have to grapple
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:04.440]   with prejudice on the basis of their religion
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:07.000]   or on the basis of their race.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000]   And to deal with that, we are gonna demand,
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.840]   we're gonna demand that agents of the state
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:18.560]   act towards people in the same way.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:23.560]   And so if that means that everybody getting on the airplane
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:30.080]   before they get on the airplane has to, you know,
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:35.080]   open up their luggage and it slows things down,
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:42.240]   but everybody has to open up their luggage,
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:47.240]   I would prefer that over a system in which we are
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:52.240]   a system in which we focus on people who are Muslim.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.480]   And one of the reasons, and I'm gonna bring this back
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:59.880]   to the racial thing, one of the reasons why I wanna insist
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.400]   upon that is because if, you know,
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:07.380]   if we all have to open up our luggage,
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:13.840]   what that means is we're all paying a tax for more security.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:17.840]   And we're all likely to ask ourselves,
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.160]   hmm, do we wanna pay this tax?
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.560]   Whereas if we focus simply on the Muslims
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.920]   and allow the Muslims to be the only ones
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:29.920]   who are sort of paying the tax, we'll force that on them.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.720]   Same in the, you know, black person, white person,
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:36.000]   25 years old, walking down the street.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.040]   Do we want to impose a racial tax on people
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:44.240]   who are black, 25 years old?
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.240]   Do we want to impose a racial tax on the black 25 year old?
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.280]   Some people would say yes.
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.120]   I say that's a mistake.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:55.360]   Black people aren't stupid.
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:57.720]   They know that they're paying this tax.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:02.720]   It is a violation of, it seems to me,
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.760]   the rules that we ought to want to have
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:08.400]   to govern our society.
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:12.680]   Please deal with everybody the same
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:19.920]   and don't allow a situation to develop
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:24.920]   in which a group of people can accurately say,
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:29.560]   we are paying more of a cost
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.720]   than these other people over here.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:35.180]   - So it's a better avoiding profile is,
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:42.720]   while it may have costs on security in the short term,
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:47.480]   in the long term, it's the embodiment of the principles
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.320]   that all men are created equal.
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.640]   So it has a much bigger benefit
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:55.160]   in representing the fairness that is at the core
[02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.920]   of the ideals of this country.
[02:04:56.920 --> 02:05:01.880]   Let me ask a big philosophical question.
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:05.000]   Why do you think there is racism in the world?
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.720]   - Oh, now you've, okay, fine.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:10.520]   Now you've asked me a question which I throw up my hands
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:12.520]   and I don't know.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.240]   - Will there always be?
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:16.280]   Why is there tribalism?
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:21.280]   Are humans always finding this way to divide ourselves?
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:25.960]   And how bad of a problem is that?
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:27.120]   - It's a huge problem.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:32.360]   I'm not gonna pretend that I know enough
[02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:38.120]   to grapple in a satisfactory way with such a question.
[02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:41.400]   I mean, to really grapple with that question,
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.400]   one really has to have a very broad knowledge base
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:52.200]   in which they can make comparisons.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.960]   I mean, the world's a big place.
[02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:56.680]   Now, from the little bit I know about the world,
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:00.360]   I read, I read as much as I can.
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.800]   I've been, I'm a very privileged character.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.840]   I mean, I live in a university,
[02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:08.240]   so I'm reading constantly and listening constantly.
[02:06:08.240 --> 02:06:12.640]   From what I gather, the problem of divided societies
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.960]   is a problem that is worldwide.
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:20.840]   There's, and it seems as though human ingenuity
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:26.520]   is such that humans will find something to divide over.
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:34.040]   It might be texture of hair.
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:39.040]   It might be complexion of skin.
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:42.360]   - Political ideology.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:43.480]   - Political ideology.
[02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:48.480]   If the texture of skin is the same,
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:55.840]   it'll then be, well, you wear these sorts of clothes.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:00.920]   You speak in this sort of way.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:07.480]   You believe this, whereas I believe that.
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:10.480]   I mean, it seems like a human ingenuity is such
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:14.200]   they will, humans will find some way
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:17.680]   of distinguishing themselves,
[02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.680]   and then they seem to want to embellish the distinction.
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:25.280]   It's not just a distinction.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:28.480]   It's not just you believe this and I believe this.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:30.600]   Okay, that makes the world interesting.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.400]   Let's talk about what you believe and what I believe.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:38.400]   No, it's usually associated with you believe this,
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.400]   I believe this.
[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:44.260]   Of course, my belief is superior to your belief,
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:48.800]   and I want to put you down,
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:52.600]   and now we're headed towards war.
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.760]   - The interesting thing is,
[02:07:53.760 --> 02:07:56.000]   if I were to step outside of this whole thing,
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.040]   from an alien perspective visiting Earth,
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.320]   I think America is one of the greatest,
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:03.600]   if not the greatest countries
[02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:05.800]   in the history of human civilization,
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.800]   and I think that the line between white and black,
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.320]   the racial struggle, is the thing that,
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.980]   in part, made it a great nation.
[02:08:16.980 --> 02:08:19.760]   There's something about the division
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:21.680]   and the way you alleviate that division
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:24.320]   through the struggle for human rights
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.320]   that makes for a great nation,
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:29.320]   and so it's interesting that the division
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:32.800]   is almost the fuel for the greatness,
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.320]   for our discovery of what it means to be human,
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:38.220]   what it means to be, or what justice means,
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:41.880]   and it's interesting that it seems like
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:45.380]   there's this struggle that you're elucidating now,
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:48.380]   but that struggle itself is our search,
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.320]   a man's search for meaning and justice and freedom.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.640]   - I think there's something to that.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:57.640]   As you were speaking, I was immediately thinking of
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:59.800]   the person who most jumped to mind
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:02.160]   was the great Frederick Douglass.
[02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.820]   So, I mean, here you have a person who, in my view,
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:08.480]   is one of the great people in the history of the world,
[02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:13.480]   and one of the things that ironically enabled him
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:15.360]   to become one of the great people of the world,
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:18.000]   he was born into slavery.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.920]   His overcoming was the very thing
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:27.920]   that, in a sense, made him this larger-than-life figure,
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.200]   and I think there's something to it.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:31.880]   I will say this, because a minute ago,
[02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:34.760]   you mentioned optimism and pessimism,
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:40.760]   and I'd say in the last few years,
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:46.200]   my feeling about the United States has changed,
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:52.000]   and it's changed in a somber way.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:57.000]   For most of my life, I've been in the optimistic camp
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.440]   with respect to my view of American race relations.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.920]   I've been in the optimistic camp
[02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:08.720]   with respect to my view of American race relations.
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:11.960]   You know, the optimistic camp, that was the camp,
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:14.800]   that's the camp that believes we shall overcome.
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:18.400]   That's Martin Luther King's camp.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.680]   I mean, Martin Luther King, you know, Martin Luther King,
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.840]   you know, hours before he's killed,
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:24.480]   I've been to the mountaintop.
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.680]   I might not get there with you,
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:29.880]   but I've glimpsed the promised land.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:30.800]   Optimism.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.200]   Frederick Douglass would be in that tradition.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.480]   There would be other people, wonderful, good people,
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.720]   who would be in that tradition.
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:45.120]   - Would you, sorry to interrupt,
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:47.240]   put in the pessimist camp, would you put Malcolm X in it?
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:48.560]   - Oh, in the pessimistic camp,
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:51.160]   the pessimistic camp is the more interesting camp.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.000]   (Luke laughs)
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.160]   I mean, ideologically, I mean, it is,
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.440]   it's the more interesting camp,
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.600]   because in the pessimistic camp, you have,
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.800]   I mean, if I was gonna list some of my pessimists,
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:03.840]   pessimist number one, Thomas Jefferson.
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:07.240]   Thomas Jefferson, the author, you know,
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:09.240]   principal author, Declaration of Independence,
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.240]   he was also the author of "Notes on the State of Virginia."
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:18.160]   And he said in "Notes on the State of Virginia,"
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.400]   basically, we shall not overcome.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:23.760]   He talked, he said, you know,
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.760]   "The black people will always know
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:36.240]   "that their forebears were enslaved,
[02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:40.160]   "and they will always be resentful of that,
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:42.400]   "always be aggrieved by that."
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.840]   Jefferson did not think that we would ever have,
[02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:50.440]   in the United States, a multiracial democracy.
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.080]   He was very critical of slavery.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.080]   Now, he was a hypocrite.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:55.360]   He had slaves, he sold slaves.
[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.800]   He was terrible in that way,
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.500]   but he did understand that slavery was horrible.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:06.020]   But he did not want,
[02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:09.620]   but he did not wanna free the slaves
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:11.020]   for a variety of reasons,
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:12.900]   but in one reason was because he thought
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:17.500]   that it would be impossible to have a society
[02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:22.500]   in which blacks and whites were equal neighbors.
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.500]   He was thoroughly pessimistic.
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:28.620]   Another pessimist, Alexis de Tocqueville,
[02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:30.860]   thoroughly pessimistic.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:32.940]   So who were some of the other pessimists?
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:36.020]   Abraham Lincoln, pessimistic.
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:38.340]   That's why he was so interested in colonization.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:41.340]   He basically said, you know, "I don't like slavery,
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:43.500]   "but blacks and whites are not gonna be able
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:44.780]   "to share the United States.
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:46.740]   "Maybe the best we can do is just, you know,
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:50.100]   "put blacks, ship blacks someplace else."
[02:12:50.100 --> 02:12:51.260]   - Can you elaborate on that?
[02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:53.700]   I think people would be surprised to hear
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:56.140]   that you will put Abraham Lincoln in the pessimist camp.
[02:12:56.140 --> 02:12:57.940]   - Oh, Abraham Lincoln's thoroughly pessimistic.
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:02.700]   He believed, he was anti-slavery,
[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:06.260]   but he did not believe that blacks and whites
[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:09.980]   would be able to share the United States together,
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:12.140]   and he was always very interested,
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.900]   therefore, in colonization.
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:19.740]   Even during the Civil War, he was interested in,
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:24.460]   maybe all black people,
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:26.180]   would all black people be interested
[02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:28.180]   in maybe going to Panama?
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:30.860]   Would they be interested in going someplace else?
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:33.260]   Because, you know, Lincoln was aware
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:37.180]   of how racist white people were, including himself,
[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:39.340]   and he did not think that black people and white people
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:42.780]   would be able to share the United States.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.900]   Now, there's a black nationalist tradition.
[02:13:44.900 --> 02:13:45.940]   You mentioned Malcolm X.
[02:13:45.940 --> 02:13:48.500]   Well, before Malcolm X, you know, Marcus Garvey.
[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:55.380]   My father, my father was a thoroughgoing pessimist.
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:00.220]   His view was, A, the United States
[02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:04.220]   was born as a white man's country.
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:07.140]   It's gonna remain a white man's country,
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:10.020]   and that's the way it is.
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:12.460]   He was thoroughly pessimistic.
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:15.220]   - You mentioned, just a brief aside about your dad,
[02:14:15.220 --> 02:14:19.420]   that when you moved from South Carolina to Washington, D.C.,
[02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:23.620]   and you asked him why, his response to you was,
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:25.980]   because either a white man was going to kill me,
[02:14:25.980 --> 02:14:27.660]   or I was going to kill a white man.
[02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:28.820]   - Yes.
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:32.380]   - So he saw race as an important line
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:34.260]   that divided people in the United States.
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:36.980]   - He certainly did, and he thought that the line,
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:43.060]   my father did not, my father had passed away
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:46.380]   before Obama was elected.
[02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:49.780]   I would have loved to have talked with my dad.
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:51.300]   - What do you think he would have said?
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:55.380]   And you've written, you wrote a book
[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.460]   about the Obama presidency.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:15:00.380]   - I did, I did, and I didn't, I never,
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:01.980]   what would my father have said?
[02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.340]   My father would have been delighted.
[02:15:03.340 --> 02:15:05.940]   My father would have been happy about his election.
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:12.100]   I do think, though, I do think that my father
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:16.980]   would have said, I'm happy that Barack Obama
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:21.980]   has been elected, hold on to your seats,
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:26.620]   let's see how the white people respond.
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:27.860]   - So he would have predicted Donald Trump.
[02:15:27.860 --> 02:15:31.620]   - I think that my father, I think that in 2016,
[02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:33.140]   I think that in 2016--
[02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:34.100]   - He would have said, I told you.
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:39.100]   - Yes, yes, I think that in 2016, my father would have said,
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:44.180]   all of you people who are talking about,
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:46.340]   I don't know what's happened to America,
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:51.340]   and how could this have happened, and you know, no.
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:53.100]   I think my father would have said,
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:58.100]   this is America being America, and what has happened
[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:03.260]   is that America has been put off kilter
[02:16:03.260 --> 02:16:07.380]   by a black family being in the White House.
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:11.580]   It has deranged millions of white people,
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:14.180]   and now this is coming home to roost.
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:17.300]   So I think my father would have absolutely said in 2016,
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:18.340]   I told you so.
[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:21.660]   - In 2016, as you're saying, is the reason
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:26.060]   that you have at least dipped your toe
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:29.340]   outside of the optimist camp into the pessimist camp.
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:34.780]   - Yeah, I wanna be careful here, and I don't wanna--
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:37.980]   - Don't give up on the optimist camp.
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:41.900]   - I don't, you're right, I don't wanna give up
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:43.820]   on the optimist camp, I don't.
[02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:48.820]   I have been, my optimism has definitely been dampened,
[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:55.060]   has definitely been tested.
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:17:00.060]   I am certainly, no, I am not as triumphalist as I once was.
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:11.380]   I am not as indignant as I once was
[02:17:11.380 --> 02:17:14.020]   in my criticism of pessimists,
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:18.100]   but at this moment as we speak,
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:22.380]   am I more in the optimist camp
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.780]   than I'm in the pessimist camp?
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.700]   I'm still probably more in the optimist camp,
[02:17:25.700 --> 02:17:28.900]   but my optimism has been dampened.
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:32.780]   But as I speak, I have to say the following things,
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:34.820]   and I'd say the following things if my father,
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:39.660]   but again, whom I revere, great man,
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:42.660]   but if my father was sitting here with us,
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:47.660]   I would say, "Listen, Pop, it's absolutely true
[02:17:47.660 --> 02:17:53.180]   "that the country is more racist than I had thought.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:54.220]   "That is true.
[02:17:54.220 --> 02:17:59.420]   "It's also true, Pop, that the Vice President
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:02.900]   "of the United States as we speak is a black woman.
[02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:09.100]   "As we speak, it's true that the Secretary of Defense
[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:11.900]   "is a black man.
[02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:16.900]   "The Secretary of Defense is the head of the Pentagon.
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:21.900]   "The Secretary of Defense knows where the button is, okay?
[02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:27.100]   "This is not a small out of the way thing.
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:33.220]   "This is the Secretary of Defense is a black man.
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:39.660]   "There are a slew of black generals.
[02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:45.260]   "There have been black secretaries of state.
[02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:51.260]   "There are black people who are the heads of police forces.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:54.500]   "There are black mayors.
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:57.260]   "There are black people who are the heads
[02:18:57.260 --> 02:19:01.020]   "of some of our foremost foundations.
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:08.500]   "The President-Elect of Harvard University
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:12.140]   "is a black woman."
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:14.300]   And we could go on and on and on and on.
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:18.620]   When I was growing up, when I was growing up,
[02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:21.100]   when I was, let's say, 10 years old,
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:25.260]   we got a magazine, Ebony Magazine, every month.
[02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.740]   And in Ebony Magazine, you could turn
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:32.100]   to the middle of Ebony, and they would have Black Firsts.
[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:33.620]   The first black person to do this,
[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:35.820]   the first black person to do this.
[02:19:35.820 --> 02:19:37.700]   You could read Ebony, and frankly,
[02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:40.100]   I could tell you all of those.
[02:19:40.100 --> 02:19:41.580]   I knew their names.
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:47.500]   Now, I read stuff,
[02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:54.980]   the leading cadet, the chief cadet
[02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:57.760]   at the United States Naval Academy.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.700]   I'm reading, I'm reading, then I see a picture.
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:06.100]   Black woman, I didn't know that.
[02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:08.260]   Back in the day, I would have known that.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:13.260]   Now, has the United States changed?
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:16.580]   Yes.
[02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:19.060]   Is there racism?
[02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:20.020]   Yes.
[02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:24.700]   Is it a substantial force in American life?
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:27.660]   Regrettably, tragically, yes.
[02:20:27.660 --> 02:20:30.620]   Has the United States changed?
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:34.320]   Yes, and again, if we wanna go international,
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:38.020]   United States is not the only country
[02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:43.020]   that is a country that has wrestled with deep division.
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:48.140]   You think about, I don't know, think about India.
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:50.780]   Think about the United Kingdom.
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:55.520]   Think about practically any large nation state.
[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.920]   They've all grappled with divisions.
[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:04.720]   If one asks about the United States and the race question,
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:10.620]   and one puts on the table that in 1865,
[02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:17.980]   now, when I talk with students, I say 1865,
[02:21:17.980 --> 02:21:22.980]   they think, oh my God, isn't that when dinosaurs roamed?
[02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:24.780]   No, it wasn't when dinosaurs roamed.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:28.500]   1865, frankly, is not all that long ago.
[02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:33.300]   In 1865, the great mass of black people
[02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:37.180]   in the United States had recently been released
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:39.660]   from chattel slavery.
[02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:42.380]   The great mass of black people in the United States
[02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:45.420]   in 1865 were illiterate.
[02:21:45.420 --> 02:21:53.980]   Now, I mean, it's absolutely,
[02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:56.760]   it's an absolutely extraordinary story.
[02:21:57.900 --> 02:22:02.620]   And so one of the difficulties I have at this moment
[02:22:02.620 --> 02:22:07.620]   is wrapping my head around two stories
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.340]   that are in such tension with one another.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:14.000]   One is the continuing story of racism,
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.580]   which is an awful story.
[02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:21.600]   But the other story is a story that is encapsulated
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:26.140]   in the title of a great book of history
[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:31.140]   by John Hope Franklin, "From Slavery to Freedom."
[02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:38.940]   And those are two stories in American life,
[02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:42.780]   and it takes an awful lot to put your mind
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:46.660]   around both stories, and I'm trying to.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:49.420]   - Well, as an optimist, I think you put more value
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:52.220]   to the overcoming side of the story,
[02:22:52.220 --> 02:22:53.660]   the overcoming of hardship,
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:56.520]   the overcoming of slavery, of discrimination.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:23:00.620]   Well, since you mentioned illiteracy from,
[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:03.740]   what is it, 150 years ago,
[02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:06.140]   let me ask you about affirmative action.
[02:23:06.140 --> 02:23:08.060]   You wrote a book on the topic,
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:10.580]   titled "For Discrimination, Race, Affirmative Action,
[02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:11.500]   and the Law."
[02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:14.780]   First, what is affirmative action?
[02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:20.760]   And maybe we could talk about what your view is on it today.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.640]   - Sure.
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:25.560]   Well, affirmative action refers to,
[02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.060]   racial affirmative action,
[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:32.460]   'cause there's various sorts of affirmative action.
[02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:35.120]   You can have affirmative action for veterans.
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:40.120]   You can have affirmative action for in-state residents.
[02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:42.460]   Let's suppose you have a school,
[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:46.020]   the University of blah, blah, blah,
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:51.020]   and we're gonna give a,
[02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:56.040]   reach out a hand to boost, help,
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:58.000]   people who live within the state.
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.560]   We're gonna have a boost for veterans.
[02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:04.220]   We're gonna have a boost for women.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:09.840]   We're gonna have a boost for men in certain circumstances.
[02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:13.480]   Well, the most,
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:17.920]   the type of affirmative action that gets most attention,
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.420]   and that's worth noting as well,
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.800]   there's lots of different sorts of affirmative action,
[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:25.800]   but when you say affirmative action,
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:27.280]   the type of affirmative action
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.940]   that immediately people are thinking about
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:32.280]   is racial affirmative.
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:34.920]   - Seems like race is at the core of this American experiment
[02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:37.880]   that we're part of, in every part of its culture.
[02:24:37.880 --> 02:24:38.840]   - Bingo, bingo.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:43.840]   Why is it that we, again, there's various ways
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:47.360]   in which institutions reach out
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.020]   to help various sectors of our population.
[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:54.540]   Why is it that this is the one
[02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:58.740]   that generates all of the pulling out of hair
[02:24:58.740 --> 02:25:00.340]   and gnashing of teeth?
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.860]   We can put that to the side for a moment.
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:06.740]   Racial affirmative action refers to efforts
[02:25:06.740 --> 02:25:08.660]   in which institutions
[02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:17.540]   reach out to provide assistance to racial minorities.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:24.880]   Now, the reaching out can happen in different ways.
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.000]   A light form of affirmative action
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.560]   might be reaching out in terms of recruiting,
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:37.560]   making a special effort to make sure that young people,
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:41.600]   let's say, in racial minority neighborhoods
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:43.360]   know about your college.
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.760]   That's recruitment.
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:25:50.680]   On the other hand, racial affirmative action
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:54.280]   might take a stronger form.
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:55.880]   It might take the form of saying,
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:58.160]   okay, we have a competition,
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:03.160]   and we think that there will be too few
[02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:08.960]   racial minority kids who do well enough in this competition
[02:26:09.700 --> 02:26:11.700]   to be admitted to our school.
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:16.500]   So what we're gonna do is we are going to,
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:22.380]   in various ways, give a boost to the minority kids.
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:27.960]   If it comes down to you have two kids,
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:33.780]   they both, I don't know, have 99 on the test.
[02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:37.060]   There's one place left.
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:39.960]   We only have one spot left, two kids.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.980]   One's a black kid, one's a white kid.
[02:26:42.980 --> 02:26:44.220]   They both got 99.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:46.060]   We're gonna give it to the black kid.
[02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:48.020]   Why?
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:49.600]   Well, black kid.
[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:51.780]   All there is to it.
[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:55.900]   Black kid, we wanna, maybe, and then our theory,
[02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:58.060]   maybe our theory is that black people
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:00.060]   have been done wrong in the United States,
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:04.560]   and we want our institution to contribute to making amends.
[02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.740]   That might be a theory.
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.480]   Another theory might be,
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:17.620]   we think that we'll have a more interesting student body.
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:19.340]   We'll have a better student body,
[02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:24.340]   a better discussion if there are more black kids on campus.
[02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:26.580]   And unless we make a special effort
[02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:28.620]   to bring more black kids on campus,
[02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:35.260]   our student body will be overwhelmingly monoracial.
[02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:39.700]   We'll just have white kids, a few Asian kids,
[02:27:39.700 --> 02:27:42.440]   a few Latino kids, if there are no black kids here.
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:48.300]   It'll be lacking an important aspect of American life.
[02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:52.600]   So that's some sort of, the so-called diversity story.
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:54.980]   So anyway, there are various theories.
[02:27:54.980 --> 02:28:00.980]   Some are grounded, like I said, in reparative justice.
[02:28:00.980 --> 02:28:03.420]   Some might be grounded in distributive justice.
[02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:05.860]   So for instance, when people say nowadays,
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:11.060]   we want a cabinet, we want a team,
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:15.100]   we want a student body that looks like America.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:18.180]   That might be a distributive justice theory
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:19.700]   for why you want affirmative action.
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:24.700]   Unless we reach out and give a boost to certain groups,
[02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:30.060]   they won't be here.
[02:28:30.060 --> 02:28:33.940]   And we want a campus that looks like America.
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:36.100]   And we won't have a campus that looks like America
[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:39.000]   unless we give a special boost to, I don't know,
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.380]   the Latino kids, or unless we give a special boost
[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:43.720]   to black applicants.
[02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:47.420]   So reparative justice, distributive justice,
[02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:51.700]   or third, diversity, we just wanna have
[02:28:51.700 --> 02:28:53.020]   an interesting student body.
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:54.460]   And to have an interesting student body,
[02:28:54.460 --> 02:28:59.400]   we want kids from a wide array of places.
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.860]   We think that that'll make for a better campus,
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.420]   more interesting campus.
[02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:07.820]   Those are three justifications, all of which, however,
[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:12.820]   are justifications for, in a competition,
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:18.040]   giving a special boost to some people based on their race.
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:19.820]   - What's your sense?
[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:22.100]   Can you make the case for affirmative action,
[02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:23.820]   and can you make the case against it?
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:25.660]   - Yeah, I can make the case for,
[02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:27.100]   and I can make the case against.
[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:30.900]   The case for, I won't spend much time on this.
[02:29:30.900 --> 02:29:35.900]   Like I said, there are three main justifications.
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:44.520]   Your audience should know that, one,
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:49.820]   the justification that actually led to affirmative action
[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:53.500]   is a justification that you don't hear about in the courts,
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:55.260]   because the courts have said that
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:58.700]   that justification is insufficient.
[02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:02.060]   So the real justification behind affirmative action
[02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:05.940]   was in the late 1960s,
[02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:08.500]   in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Revolution,
[02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:11.060]   in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement,
[02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:13.260]   there was a feeling that, well, okay, fine,
[02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:16.540]   we're not discriminating against black people anymore,
[02:30:16.540 --> 02:30:20.700]   but black people have been disadvantaged
[02:30:20.700 --> 02:30:24.120]   by the discrimination that has been put upon them,
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:28.820]   and this discrimination that was put upon them
[02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:30.220]   has disabled them.
[02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:36.300]   And so they go into competitions, and it's unfair.
[02:30:36.300 --> 02:30:40.140]   Yeah, they score less well on the standardized test,
[02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:43.860]   but surprise, surprise, what the heck?
[02:30:43.860 --> 02:30:47.020]   They went to schools
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:51.180]   in which they got the leavings of the white folks.
[02:30:51.180 --> 02:30:56.180]   The white folks gave the black folks the old textbooks.
[02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:59.240]   That's what the black kids read.
[02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:01.940]   The white kids read the newest textbooks,
[02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:02.900]   on and on and on.
[02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:05.980]   So reparative justice,
[02:31:05.980 --> 02:31:10.660]   we're gonna try to repair the scars
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:15.100]   left by past racial injustice.
[02:31:15.100 --> 02:31:19.700]   And so it's sort of an effort to overcome
[02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:22.780]   the vestiges of past misdeeds.
[02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:25.140]   That was one justification for affirmative action.
[02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:27.980]   And frankly, I think that's the justification
[02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:31.640]   that has always been the predominant justification,
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:33.940]   whether people owned up to it or not.
[02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:36.020]   But that's one justification.
[02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.380]   The distributive justice justification is there.
[02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:43.120]   Like I say, people, we want an integrated America.
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:45.760]   We want an America that looks like America.
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:50.860]   In that justification,
[02:31:50.860 --> 02:31:54.180]   legitimacy is sometimes mentioned.
[02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:59.180]   So for instance, people will say things like,
[02:31:59.180 --> 02:32:03.180]   well, if we're gonna, in the armed forces,
[02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:05.540]   you can't have an armed forces
[02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:10.540]   in which the people on the ground
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:15.200]   are, you have a lot of people on the ground
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:16.900]   who are people of color,
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:19.140]   but none of the people calling the shots,
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:24.060]   none of the generals, none of the main colonels
[02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:25.180]   are people of color.
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:26.660]   No, and then, you know,
[02:32:26.660 --> 02:32:31.440]   the people on the ground are not gonna stand for that.
[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:34.620]   So for purposes of legitimation,
[02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:39.220]   we need to, for purposes of buy-in,
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:43.860]   we need to have a situation in which people get the sense
[02:32:43.860 --> 02:32:47.780]   that even if they're sort of low down,
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:52.220]   they're still part of the story, they're part of the team.
[02:32:52.220 --> 02:32:56.260]   So that's part of the sort of, you know,
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:00.300]   I don't know, distributive justice notion.
[02:33:00.300 --> 02:33:01.420]   - Do you think there's power to that?
[02:33:01.420 --> 02:33:02.740]   I mean, do you think there's value,
[02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:04.500]   there's correctness to that kind of idea?
[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:05.860]   - I think there's some.
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:07.400]   - 'Cause for the application process
[02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:08.340]   for different universities,
[02:33:08.340 --> 02:33:11.100]   I think that's probably a driving narrative,
[02:33:11.100 --> 02:33:16.100]   justification for, well, affirmative action,
[02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:19.500]   I don't know where we put DEI efforts,
[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:23.280]   because they overlap, but they're not perfectly overlapping.
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.900]   - The reason that the school, so yeah, as you know,
[02:33:26.900 --> 02:33:29.700]   there is a case, we'll know about it,
[02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:32.140]   it'll be announced sometime in the next month,
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:36.540]   well, month, month and a half.
[02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:41.180]   It's a case of the Supreme Court of the United States
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:44.500]   in which the affirmative action program at Harvard
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.960]   and the affirmative action program
[02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:49.100]   at the University of North Carolina are being challenged.
[02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.460]   Most people think, including me,
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:54.000]   that the Supreme Court of the United States
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:59.000]   is going to limit, if not totally seek,
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:03.500]   to abolish affirmative action.
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.540]   So this is a very burning issue.
[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:09.060]   As things currently stand,
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:15.220]   my university and other universities
[02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:18.740]   embrace affirmative action on the third ground,
[02:34:18.740 --> 02:34:20.140]   the diversity ground.
[02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:25.140]   And what they say is we need affirmative action
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:30.660]   because affirmative action is good for pedagogical reasons.
[02:34:32.060 --> 02:34:35.700]   Now, frankly, do I think there's something to that?
[02:34:35.700 --> 02:34:37.460]   I think there's a little something to that
[02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:39.540]   with respect to some subjects.
[02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:43.540]   I don't think that's what's really going on
[02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:44.540]   for the most part.
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:46.500]   I mean, if that's what's really going on,
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:49.500]   why don't we have more foreign students?
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:52.340]   Why isn't there a greater effort
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:53.740]   to bring in more foreign students?
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:56.740]   Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in more,
[02:34:56.740 --> 02:35:00.540]   I don't know, religious fundamentalists?
[02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:02.580]   Why isn't there a greater effort to bring in,
[02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:05.620]   and you could just name various groups
[02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:08.260]   that are, you hardly ever see them on campus.
[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:10.860]   - So you don't think this kind of effort
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:15.580]   of driving towards diversity is rigorous enough?
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:17.260]   - I think it's often pretextual.
[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:22.260]   I think, frankly, the real reason has to do with the belief,
[02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:24.940]   and I think it's a good belief.
[02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:26.740]   I associate myself with the belief.
[02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:30.320]   It's just that because of the legal rules,
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:34.940]   the authorities can't say this belief out loud,
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:37.620]   but it's still the case that a lot of institutions
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:42.620]   want to help American society overcome its racial past.
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:46.220]   That's the real animating force.
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:48.540]   Now, this thing about, you know,
[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:50.940]   we'll have better classroom discussions,
[02:35:50.940 --> 02:35:53.140]   you know, some discussions, I mean, you know,
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:56.660]   with some subjects, yeah, listen,
[02:35:56.660 --> 02:36:00.400]   I'm an ignoramus when it comes to physics.
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:02.240]   My sense of it is, however,
[02:36:02.240 --> 02:36:05.640]   that if you're talking about physics,
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:07.000]   you're talking about physics,
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.120]   and frankly, it doesn't much matter
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:11.960]   in terms of mastering physics
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.080]   what the demographics of that classroom are.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:16.960]   You either know physics or you don't.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:18.160]   - The interesting thing I've noticed
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:22.160]   since doing this podcast is one way it does matter,
[02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:26.660]   it's really lonely when you do a thing
[02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:28.860]   and you don't see somebody that looks like you
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:30.020]   doing that thing.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:32.860]   And it's such a seemingly stupid thing.
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:35.100]   Why does it matter if there's another person
[02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:38.740]   that looks like you in this very shallow sense?
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:40.740]   But it seems to matter to people.
[02:36:40.740 --> 02:36:43.620]   And when I talk to, for example, women on this podcast,
[02:36:43.620 --> 02:36:46.980]   a lot of women reach out saying how inspiring that is.
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:48.020]   That's interesting, right?
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:50.340]   Like, I think we're still human
[02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.860]   and we see people that look like us,
[02:36:52.860 --> 02:36:55.940]   and this kind of narrow, shallow definition
[02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:57.460]   of diversity still matters.
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:02.380]   - Okay, well, you know, I think you've made a good point,
[02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:05.780]   and maybe so.
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.140]   So let's go back to the physics.
[02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:10.680]   I mean, let's suppose that under one scenario,
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:14.180]   there's a classroom and a kid sticks his head,
[02:37:14.180 --> 02:37:16.740]   a black kid sticks his head in the classroom
[02:37:16.740 --> 02:37:19.340]   and doesn't see anybody else black there
[02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.500]   and has to make a quick decision and says,
[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:23.660]   "Yeah, you know, nah, this ain't for me."
[02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:28.140]   Versus they stick their head in the classroom,
[02:37:28.140 --> 02:37:30.660]   they see a smattering of other black people in the classroom,
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:32.500]   they say, "Oh, let me try this."
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:34.300]   And then they try it and it turns out,
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.580]   damn it, they're Albert Einstein.
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:42.460]   So to that extent, I can see under that scenario,
[02:37:42.460 --> 02:37:43.900]   maybe it does matter.
[02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.260]   So I'll have to recalibrate.
[02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:51.260]   Still, those are the three leading justifications
[02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:52.660]   for affirmative action.
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:54.180]   You asked me where do I stand
[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:55.580]   with respect to affirmative action?
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:59.460]   Oh, no, before we get to that, are there criticisms?
[02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:01.980]   The answer is yes, there are criticisms
[02:38:01.980 --> 02:38:02.940]   of affirmative action.
[02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:07.860]   Affirmative action is a policy like, you know, any policy.
[02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:10.940]   Any policy is gonna have some downsides to it.
[02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:12.420]   And affirmative action is no different.
[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:14.020]   Does affirmative action have some downsides?
[02:38:14.020 --> 02:38:15.580]   Yes, it does have some downsides.
[02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:16.420]   What are they?
[02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:18.660]   Well, let me mention a couple.
[02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:23.660]   One, stigma, stigma.
[02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:30.260]   So if you have an institution that says
[02:38:30.260 --> 02:38:35.260]   that it reaches out to give a boost to certain people
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:40.260]   on a racial basis,
[02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:45.460]   there are gonna be people who observe that
[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:48.740]   and who are gonna be thinking to themselves,
[02:38:48.740 --> 02:38:52.380]   hmm, if so-and-so is here
[02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:54.700]   and they were given a special boost,
[02:38:54.700 --> 02:39:01.140]   doesn't that mean that they were not as proficient
[02:39:01.140 --> 02:39:03.340]   as the other people who are here
[02:39:03.340 --> 02:39:06.180]   and who did not have that boost?
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:08.220]   So if they are not as proficient,
[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:11.460]   that means that they might not be as good.
[02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.380]   They might not be as up to snuff.
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:19.180]   Is that part of our affirmative action world?
[02:39:19.180 --> 02:39:23.260]   Yes, it's part of our affirmative action world, yes.
[02:39:23.260 --> 02:39:26.860]   I'm a professor at Harvard Law School.
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:29.220]   One of the subjects I teach is contracts.
[02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:34.460]   Actually, that's probably the subject I most enjoy teaching.
[02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:39.460]   I think I most enjoy writing about racial conflict
[02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:43.060]   and the legal system, but as far as teaching,
[02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:45.500]   I most enjoy teaching contracts.
[02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:49.820]   Well, on that very first day, on the very first day,
[02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:52.860]   when I, you know, 80 students come,
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:55.820]   especially the first-year students, they're nervous,
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:59.220]   I show up.
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:03.900]   I'm quite sure that there's some students there
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:08.300]   who are thinking, okay, well,
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:14.180]   is this guy as good as my other teachers?
[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:17.020]   Because, you know, I know that, you know,
[02:40:17.020 --> 02:40:19.900]   institutions like Harvard have made a special effort
[02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:23.140]   to bring in people like this guy, Kennedy.
[02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:25.580]   Is he as good?
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:28.740]   Well, I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:33.540]   If you have an affirmative action regime,
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:35.260]   people are gonna think that.
[02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:36.860]   And are they crazy to think that?
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:38.900]   No, they're not crazy to think that.
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:43.460]   No, that's a perfectly logical thing
[02:40:43.460 --> 02:40:45.540]   for somebody to think.
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:50.020]   Does it have an effect on me as the teacher?
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.740]   Yeah, actually, it does have an effect on me, sure.
[02:40:52.740 --> 02:40:56.260]   I'm aware that some people are thinking that.
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:59.140]   It doesn't, I'm not, you know,
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:04.140]   it doesn't, you know, make me shake in my boots.
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:05.580]   Am I aware of it?
[02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:06.740]   Yeah, I'm aware of it.
[02:41:06.740 --> 02:41:07.940]   Does it have an effect?
[02:41:07.940 --> 02:41:09.660]   Yeah, it probably does have an effect.
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:10.500]   It probably does.
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:15.500]   It probably, it probably makes me,
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:24.700]   it probably makes me redouble my efforts
[02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:30.620]   because I don't want anybody to think justifiably
[02:41:30.620 --> 02:41:34.820]   that I'm less able than my colleagues.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:39.180]   So, you know, it's funny.
[02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:41.340]   When I was growing up, my father used to tell me
[02:41:41.340 --> 02:41:45.700]   over and over again, "Randy, tie, tie, you lose, okay,
[02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:47.500]   brother, let me just tell you that."
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:50.420]   And he was telling me that because when he was, you know,
[02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:53.340]   in an earlier time, tie, tie, you lose,
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:57.300]   it was, you know, if it's even
[02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.220]   and there's a choice to be made,
[02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:02.340]   the white person is gonna get the benefit of the doubt.
[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:04.980]   Now, under affirmative action,
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:07.060]   there's been a switcheroo.
[02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:08.820]   Oftentimes it's the black person
[02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:10.740]   who gets the benefit of the doubt,
[02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:13.620]   but I'm still in a situation which-
[02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:14.460]   Don't have to work hard.
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:18.940]   Yes, to avoid the stigmatization
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:21.380]   that is imposed by affirmative action.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:22.580]   But is that stigma there?
[02:42:22.580 --> 02:42:23.980]   Yes, it's there.
[02:42:23.980 --> 02:42:24.820]   It is there.
[02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:27.500]   I'll tell you another way in which it comes up
[02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:28.580]   from a student's point of view.
[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:29.860]   I'll never forget this.
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:32.780]   It was in my second year of law school.
[02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:35.620]   It was in tax class.
[02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:39.660]   We had a very famous tax teacher, wonderful tax teacher.
[02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:41.620]   On the very first day of class,
[02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:49.340]   Professor Bittker, wonderful man, wonderful teacher,
[02:42:49.340 --> 02:42:53.020]   Boris Bittker called on,
[02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:55.900]   the very first person he called on was a black student.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:58.580]   I remember this as if it were yesterday,
[02:42:58.580 --> 02:43:01.540]   called on a black student and it was a black woman student.
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:05.340]   And I remember when he called on her,
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:09.980]   I remember just, I felt,
[02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:16.700]   I felt as if the room got quieter.
[02:43:16.700 --> 02:43:19.260]   Really, I felt as if the room got quieter
[02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:22.820]   and I know there was a real tenseness within me.
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:24.700]   He didn't call on me 'cause he was calling on somebody else,
[02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:26.100]   was a black woman student.
[02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:30.780]   And I felt different.
[02:43:30.780 --> 02:43:35.780]   I felt as if I was,
[02:43:35.780 --> 02:43:44.540]   I felt as if I was somehow at issue.
[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:53.540]   I felt as if my place, I felt as if my status
[02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:58.540]   was to some small degree at issue.
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:02.380]   - In the positive direction or the negative?
[02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:04.180]   - Just at issue. - At issue.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:06.620]   - And so, all of this is happening really quickly.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:08.500]   He calls on the student.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:10.980]   This is happening in seconds.
[02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:15.420]   And she responded and she responded really strongly.
[02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:18.620]   It was clear he asked her a question,
[02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:21.300]   she answered the question, she answered the question,
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:24.140]   beautiful, I mean, very strong,
[02:44:24.140 --> 02:44:27.980]   comprehensive, wonderful response.
[02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:31.540]   Now you might say, okay, well, smart student, okay, fine.
[02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:36.540]   Next, after class, after class, I went up to her
[02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:40.740]   and I clearly remember this.
[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:45.380]   I said, that was great, thank you.
[02:44:45.380 --> 02:44:47.380]   Why?
[02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:50.780]   Because I'm a black student,
[02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:54.500]   predominantly white institution, Yale Law School.
[02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:59.500]   And I felt some of the, again, affirmative action,
[02:44:59.500 --> 02:45:10.540]   I felt some of the burden
[02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:15.260]   of this affirmative action stigma.
[02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:18.260]   - So it was almost like a thank you
[02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:20.500]   for showing that we belong here.
[02:45:20.500 --> 02:45:23.060]   - Yes, perfect, boom.
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:25.740]   Yes, that's exactly what the situation,
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:28.220]   and by the way, I wasn't the only one.
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:30.620]   I wasn't being idiosyncratic.
[02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:31.780]   I wasn't the only one.
[02:45:31.780 --> 02:45:33.980]   There weren't many black people in that class,
[02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:37.700]   but all of us.
[02:45:37.700 --> 02:45:39.260]   And we laughed about it later.
[02:45:39.260 --> 02:45:41.660]   We laughed about it, but that was there.
[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:44.500]   So there's the stigma issue,
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:46.460]   and some people have made a lot of this.
[02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.780]   Some people have really made a lot of the stigma issue.
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:53.100]   My attitude towards the stigma issue, yeah, it's there.
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:58.100]   It's, again, it's part of the situation,
[02:45:58.100 --> 02:46:00.980]   but I think that the benefits outweigh the burdens.
[02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:01.820]   But is that a burden?
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:02.740]   Yeah, that's a burden.
[02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:03.780]   What are some others?
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:08.700]   Resentment, resentment in society.
[02:46:08.700 --> 02:46:12.980]   And that's, so in the fancy schools,
[02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:15.260]   and by the way, remember when we're talking
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:16.620]   about affirmative action,
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:20.740]   most colleges and universities in the United States,
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:23.500]   there is no affirmative action issue
[02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:24.780]   because they're not selective.
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:26.340]   Hell, they'll take anybody who,
[02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:28.780]   if you can pay, come on in.
[02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:33.380]   It's only a fairly small set of schools that are selective,
[02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:35.980]   but of course, those are the most elite schools.
[02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:39.420]   Those are the schools that people most want to get into,
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:41.300]   and that's one of the reasons why we have all this
[02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:42.620]   fighting over those schools.
[02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:43.460]   Now,
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:51.060]   there's a whole, how many millions of people
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:56.060]   are there in America who have applied to various places?
[02:46:56.060 --> 02:46:59.660]   They didn't get in, and what do they say?
[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:02.740]   The white person who applied to Harvard,
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:05.260]   applied to Yale, applied to Columbia,
[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:11.940]   applied to Georgetown, applied to NYU,
[02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:14.580]   didn't get in.
[02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:15.780]   What do they say?
[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:17.700]   I would have gotten in
[02:47:17.700 --> 02:47:20.660]   if it hadn't been for that racial affirmative action.
[02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:22.220]   They're resentful.
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:24.580]   Well, should they be resentful?
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:27.100]   No, they shouldn't be resentful, but they are resentful.
[02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:28.140]   Does that have a consequence?
[02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:29.780]   Yeah, it has a consequence.
[02:47:29.780 --> 02:47:32.260]   It has a consequence on how they act towards other people.
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:34.260]   It has a consequence on how they vote.
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:39.260]   It has a consequence, and that's something.
[02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:44.620]   Are there other things?
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:49.620]   Yeah, and in my book, I go through various,
[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:58.140]   I think that there is a certain sort of denialism
[02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:07.940]   that has accompanied the affirmative action debate.
[02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:13.100]   So because black people like myself,
[02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:19.100]   want to avoid the stigmatizing burden of affirmative action,
[02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:30.060]   there's some people who to deal with that have said,
[02:48:30.060 --> 02:48:35.060]   oh, actually, there is no difference between
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:42.740]   the beneficiaries of affirmative action and the other kids.
[02:48:42.740 --> 02:48:44.620]   There is no difference.
[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:48.940]   If the affirmative action kids got, let's say, a 500,
[02:48:48.940 --> 02:48:51.620]   and the other kids got a 750,
[02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:54.020]   that doesn't make any difference.
[02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:55.980]   That's just BS.
[02:48:55.980 --> 02:48:58.540]   The only reason the kid who,
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:02.980]   the 550 kid didn't get 750 is because the test asks
[02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:07.460]   all sorts of culturally biased things,
[02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:09.060]   like what is a yacht?
[02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:13.900]   Well, sorry.
[02:49:13.900 --> 02:49:18.660]   Yes, there is a difference.
[02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:21.020]   There's a 200 point difference.
[02:49:21.020 --> 02:49:22.140]   Does the difference matter?
[02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:23.820]   Yes, the difference matters.
[02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:27.060]   And by the way, if you don't know what a yacht is,
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:30.020]   you can know what a yacht is without owning a yacht, okay?
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:36.380]   And there's this denialism that I think has really seeped
[02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:42.020]   into various conversations.
[02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:43.860]   - That can have a slippery slope effect
[02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:45.220]   that's beyond just this.
[02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:47.940]   - Yes, and we see it in various ways.
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:51.220]   So this attack on testing,
[02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:53.740]   it's not like I'm holding,
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:56.340]   some tests are not good tests.
[02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:58.700]   I think we should be skeptical of everything,
[02:49:58.700 --> 02:50:00.460]   but there are a lot of tests that,
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:02.380]   yeah, they tell us something, all right.
[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:04.540]   They tell us who knows what.
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:08.060]   And there's some people who are really
[02:50:08.060 --> 02:50:10.300]   dead set against testing because they're dead set
[02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:12.660]   against anything that might show a gap.
[02:50:12.660 --> 02:50:16.180]   Well, I think by the way, are there gaps?
[02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:18.140]   Yeah, there are gaps.
[02:50:18.140 --> 02:50:22.220]   And what we need to do is be cognizant of those gaps
[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:26.500]   and do things to make it so that if there's a gap,
[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:31.140]   if you're deficient, no shame in being deficient.
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.300]   Heck, I'm deficient about a lot of things.
[02:50:34.180 --> 02:50:39.180]   Let's learn so that I catch up.
[02:50:39.180 --> 02:50:43.020]   But I think sometimes there have been people
[02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:48.020]   who've been afraid of even acknowledging the gaps.
[02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:54.420]   - Of course, there's, I guess a colleague of yours,
[02:50:54.420 --> 02:50:57.580]   Michael Sandel, with Tyranny and Merit.
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:50:59.980]   There's interesting, rigorous ways
[02:50:59.980 --> 02:51:01.700]   to kind of challenge ways.
[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:03.100]   On the flip side of that,
[02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.460]   where obsessing with merit can go wrong also.
[02:51:05.460 --> 02:51:07.700]   - Yes, you mentioned Michael Sandel.
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:11.540]   He's a wonderful colleague and he's a wonderful friend.
[02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:13.660]   I've known him a long time.
[02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:17.260]   I think he makes very important arguments
[02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:20.380]   about meritocracy.
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:25.220]   I disagree with some of the points
[02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:26.060]   that he makes about meritocracy.
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:28.860]   - You do, so you lean towards the importance of meritocracy.
[02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:33.020]   - I think that, yes, I think that there are values
[02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:35.300]   in meritocracy extremely important.
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:40.300]   That in fact, the movement from feudalism,
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:46.580]   the movement from status, the idea of,
[02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:51.660]   I don't care who your father or mother was.
[02:51:51.660 --> 02:51:53.900]   I don't care from what part of town you come from.
[02:51:53.900 --> 02:51:55.860]   I don't care what your last name is.
[02:51:55.860 --> 02:51:58.420]   I don't care what color of your skin is.
[02:51:58.420 --> 02:52:00.860]   Show me what you can do.
[02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:02.980]   And then somebody sits down,
[02:52:02.980 --> 02:52:05.300]   okay, I'll show you what I can do.
[02:52:05.300 --> 02:52:07.300]   And they show it, you're in.
[02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:11.060]   I think there's a lot to that.
[02:52:11.060 --> 02:52:15.180]   And the impulse, the sentiments behind that,
[02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:19.140]   I resonate with that.
[02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:20.580]   I think that there's a lot there.
[02:52:20.580 --> 02:52:25.020]   What I wanna do is I wanna get rid
[02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:30.020]   of those features in society that deprive people
[02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:35.940]   of what you need to develop yourself.
[02:52:35.940 --> 02:52:41.860]   Sometimes those are psychological.
[02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:46.860]   Sometimes it's, you're not around people who've done things
[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:48.940]   that give you the idea that you can do things.
[02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:51.220]   I wanna get rid of that.
[02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:56.220]   But the idea of people,
[02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:02.900]   the idea, by the way, of distinguishing.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.740]   This is excellent.
[02:53:06.740 --> 02:53:11.740]   And the people who are excellent, they're here.
[02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:16.660]   And then there are people who are good.
[02:53:16.660 --> 02:53:18.380]   Are they excellent?
[02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:19.860]   No, they're not excellent.
[02:53:19.860 --> 02:53:20.900]   They're good.
[02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:27.820]   I'm not gonna close my eyes to that distinction.
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:31.780]   - And highlight that distinction,
[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:34.860]   and yet at the same time, maintain a sense
[02:53:34.860 --> 02:53:38.420]   that their basic worth as a human being is equal.
[02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:43.420]   - Yes, so, was it Run-DMC, one of the rap groups?
[02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:51.780]   We're all written down on the same list.
[02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:54.620]   We're all written down on the same list.
[02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:59.620]   Yes, so I wanna recognize our fundamental humanity.
[02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:04.380]   I don't think that that,
[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:07.180]   I think that one can recognize our fundamental humanity,
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:10.940]   and one can also recognize, as far as I'm concerned,
[02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:15.940]   that we all collectively should make sure
[02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:20.060]   that we do all that we can to prevent people
[02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:24.300]   from sinking below a certain level and being in misery.
[02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:27.060]   I'm all for that.
[02:54:27.060 --> 02:54:32.900]   But I wanna be careful about some of the attacks
[02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:37.300]   that I hear on meritocracy.
[02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:39.740]   So some of the people, including, again,
[02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:44.740]   I have all the respect in the world for Michael Sandel.
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:48.140]   He talks about the arrogance of the winners.
[02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:54.060]   Okay, I wanna be, I don't want the winners to be arrogant.
[02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:56.860]   That's right, luck has a lot to do with things.
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:01.860]   You didn't have any control over the circumstances
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:03.380]   in which you were born into.
[02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:07.780]   You were lucky that you were born healthy
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:12.060]   and that you were born with a well-working mind.
[02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:13.300]   You didn't have anything to do with that.
[02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:14.380]   That was pure luck.
[02:55:14.380 --> 02:55:16.420]   There's some people who don't have that luck.
[02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:21.420]   So don't be Mr. Big Stuff, okay?
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:27.340]   So I'm against that sort of arrogance.
[02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:32.340]   I'm entitled as if I taught myself how to read.
[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.060]   No, you didn't teach yourself how to read.
[02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:37.820]   There was people who did all sorts of things for you
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.180]   and you don't even know it.
[02:55:39.180 --> 02:55:44.660]   Okay, so I wanna get rid of the arrogance,
[02:55:44.660 --> 02:55:48.820]   have decent humility.
[02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:50.180]   I'm all for that.
[02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:51.740]   At the same time,
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:57.740]   I wanna be careful about the problem of envy.
[02:55:57.740 --> 02:56:04.340]   I wanna be careful about the problem of resentment.
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:07.500]   I wanna be careful about,
[02:56:07.500 --> 02:56:15.500]   so let's not have, let's not give a trophy
[02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:21.740]   to the person who wins the race
[02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:25.860]   because to give a trophy to the person who wins the race
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:29.340]   will make the person who they defeated feel bad.
[02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:33.060]   No, no, no, no, I don't want that.
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:36.580]   I wanna give a trophy to the person who wins the race
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:41.580]   because I think it's a good thing to valorize the best.
[02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:49.700]   - Yeah, it's a kind of celebration
[02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:53.220]   of this whole human project that we're on.
[02:56:53.220 --> 02:56:55.060]   - Yes. - It's celebrating the best.
[02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:58.780]   You mentioned your father several times.
[02:56:58.780 --> 02:57:00.180]   So let me just linger on that.
[02:57:00.180 --> 02:57:02.000]   What have you learned from,
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.660]   what have you learned about life from your father?
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:12.180]   - I've been just such a lucky person.
[02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:16.140]   I mean, I feel like I've just lived
[02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:20.860]   an absolutely charmed life.
[02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:25.560]   And I live, I mean,
[02:57:25.560 --> 02:57:31.700]   the work that I do is what I love doing.
[02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:38.660]   I would pay to do what I am paid to do.
[02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:39.500]   (Chuck laughs)
[02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:42.820]   - Yeah. - I mean, it's great.
[02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:47.820]   And I've been fortunate in so many ways.
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:53.540]   And one way in which I've been fortunate is my parents.
[02:57:53.540 --> 02:57:58.740]   My parents, Rachel Spann Kennedy, Henry Harold Kennedy,
[02:57:58.740 --> 02:58:02.420]   my mother born in Columbia, South Carolina,
[02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:07.420]   my father from New Orleans, Louisiana.
[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:10.380]   They were refugees from the Jim Crow South.
[02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:17.420]   They were people who put their all into their children.
[02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:23.140]   I have an older brother, I have a younger sister.
[02:58:23.140 --> 02:58:28.140]   All three of us know beyond any controversy
[02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:35.300]   that we were loved and dearly loved by our parents.
[02:58:35.300 --> 02:58:39.780]   And they were great people.
[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:44.780]   My father, very interesting man, very independent-minded.
[02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:50.280]   He was perfectly willing to go his own way.
[02:58:50.280 --> 02:58:55.460]   And I learned much from him, including,
[02:58:55.460 --> 02:58:56.900]   I learned things from him
[02:58:56.900 --> 02:58:58.660]   even when I ultimately disagreed with him.
[02:58:58.660 --> 02:59:01.940]   So for instance, again, to go back to his pessimism,
[02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:05.240]   yeah, he was pessimistic, thoroughly pessimistic.
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:13.180]   But he was also willing to change in certain ways.
[02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:16.900]   In fact, both my parents.
[02:59:16.900 --> 02:59:18.340]   I mean, one of the most important things
[02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:22.540]   that happened to my parents was that I'd say
[02:59:22.540 --> 02:59:29.680]   when I was, let's say 10 years old, I was born in 1954.
[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:35.300]   So in 1964, in 1964, I think my parents
[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:40.300]   would have taken the position that you definitely never,
[02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:44.140]   under any circumstances, trust a white person.
[02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.580]   If a black person trusts a white person,
[02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:48.220]   that person is a fool.
[02:59:48.220 --> 02:59:51.240]   Do not trust white people, all right?
[02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:53.340]   They are not to be trusted.
[02:59:53.340 --> 02:59:58.340]   And it's the highly, highly, highly unusual one
[02:59:58.340 --> 03:00:02.400]   who is not prejudiced, okay?
[03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:04.300]   So white people are not to be trusted.
[03:00:04.300 --> 03:00:08.300]   And by and large, they're gonna be your enemy, all right?
[03:00:08.300 --> 03:00:09.340]   So let's just face that.
[03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:12.000]   That was their point of view.
[03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:19.460]   I'd say that 10 years later,
[03:00:19.460 --> 03:00:26.100]   that point of view had been leavened somewhat.
[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:31.620]   I think, and you say, well, what happened in those 10 years?
[03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:35.780]   Well, certainly in my life,
[03:00:35.780 --> 03:00:40.020]   one of the things that happened in those 10 years is
[03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:47.740]   I was a student in various schools,
[03:00:47.740 --> 03:00:53.340]   and I had a series of teachers.
[03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:55.360]   I've had wonderful black teachers.
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:58.720]   I've also had wonderful white teachers.
[03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:04.140]   And my parents paid attention to who my teachers were
[03:01:04.140 --> 03:01:05.920]   and how my teachers treated me.
[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:12.060]   And I think that they were affected by the way
[03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:17.940]   in which there were white people who really helped me
[03:01:17.940 --> 03:01:26.140]   and were on my side and were thoroughly on my side.
[03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:32.380]   And I think that that experience
[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:39.580]   changed my parents in their general view.
[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:42.600]   They, you know, skeptical, yeah, but they were,
[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:49.380]   the possibility, the possibility of a white person
[03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:57.020]   genuinely being the friend of a black person
[03:01:58.020 --> 03:02:02.260]   that became alive to them.
[03:02:02.260 --> 03:02:03.860]   And I give them a lot of credit
[03:02:03.860 --> 03:02:05.620]   'cause they were adults.
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:10.020]   And for an adult to change, that's a big deal.
[03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.740]   But my parents did change.
[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:15.060]   - In that transformation that was inspiring to you,
[03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:18.500]   was formative to you in terms of joining the Optimist camp?
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:19.540]   - Hugely.
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:24.540]   And the school, I mean, again, I said a moment ago
[03:02:26.220 --> 03:02:27.460]   how lucky I've been.
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:32.340]   Heck, I teach at Harvard Law School.
[03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:38.340]   I attended Balliol College, Oxford.
[03:02:38.340 --> 03:02:43.460]   I got my law degree from Yale Law School.
[03:02:43.460 --> 03:02:48.540]   I got my undergraduate degree at Princeton University.
[03:02:48.540 --> 03:02:50.340]   Those are some pretty good schools.
[03:02:50.340 --> 03:02:52.860]   They all were, they all were.
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:56.780]   The most important school, however, that I attended,
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:03:00.500]   the school that made the most difference in my education
[03:03:00.500 --> 03:03:03.180]   was my high school, St. Albans School,
[03:03:03.180 --> 03:03:05.380]   St. Albans School for Boys.
[03:03:05.380 --> 03:03:10.380]   And at St. Albans, I encountered a cadre of teachers.
[03:03:10.380 --> 03:03:17.440]   And by the way, at St. Albans, when I went to St. Albans,
[03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:21.300]   all these teachers were white, all of these teachers.
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:26.300]   There was one, the head of athletics,
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:30.580]   very important man, very impressive man, Brooks Johnson,
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:35.580]   was black, otherwise, white teachers.
[03:03:35.580 --> 03:03:40.720]   And these teachers made a huge difference in my life.
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:46.420]   And I can call their names, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:03:46.420 --> 03:03:49.780]   The greatest of them all was a man
[03:03:49.780 --> 03:03:54.780]   by the name of Jack McCune.
[03:03:54.780 --> 03:03:59.220]   Yeah, we called him Gentleman Jack,
[03:03:59.220 --> 03:04:00.840]   Gentleman Jack McCune.
[03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:04.180]   And-- - What subject did he teach?
[03:04:04.180 --> 03:04:07.140]   - He taught me history.
[03:04:07.140 --> 03:04:10.500]   He was my advanced placement history teacher.
[03:04:10.500 --> 03:04:16.940]   But John F. McCune, and we shared a birthday,
[03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:22.820]   John F. McCune was a fabulously good teacher.
[03:04:22.820 --> 03:04:30.860]   And we developed a deep lifetime friendship.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:37.180]   I was with Mr. McCune the day before he died.
[03:04:42.060 --> 03:04:47.060]   And he was a white man.
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:55.380]   And I've had other teachers,
[03:04:55.380 --> 03:04:57.940]   some of whom have become colleagues of mine.
[03:04:57.940 --> 03:05:04.020]   Sanford Levinson, Sanford Levinson was a teacher of mine
[03:05:04.020 --> 03:05:09.020]   at Princeton, he's become a colleague of mine.
[03:05:10.700 --> 03:05:12.500]   I mean, it would be, frankly,
[03:05:12.500 --> 03:05:15.360]   it would be impossible for me to,
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:23.460]   I can't make some sort of blanket condemnation
[03:05:23.460 --> 03:05:32.680]   of white people with Sandy Levinson in my life.
[03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:36.220]   I mean, seriously, with John F. McCune in my life,
[03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:39.060]   with Eric Foner in my life,
[03:05:39.060 --> 03:05:42.340]   with my colleague Martha Minow in my life,
[03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:46.740]   my colleague Cass Sunstein in my life, impossible!
[03:05:46.740 --> 03:05:47.900]   - You know, that speaks to the power
[03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:49.900]   of teachers and mentors.
[03:05:49.900 --> 03:05:50.740]   - Oh yeah.
[03:05:50.740 --> 03:05:53.700]   - And you're that to a lot of people.
[03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:57.160]   - Well, I've taken that to, I hope, I hope,
[03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:02.160]   listen, I would be, listen, I would be absolutely overjoyed
[03:06:02.160 --> 03:06:08.740]   if there was a student who thought of me
[03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:13.180]   in the way that I think of gentleman Jack McCune.
[03:06:13.180 --> 03:06:18.180]   If that's the case, just one, just one,
[03:06:18.180 --> 03:06:22.140]   if that's the case, I'm overjoyed.
[03:06:22.140 --> 03:06:24.820]   - That's a life well lived.
[03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:29.820]   What do you think of Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream"?
[03:06:29.820 --> 03:06:31.980]   Do you still share that dream?
[03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:34.260]   - I think that Martin Luther King Jr.'s
[03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:37.580]   "I Have a Dream" speech is one of the great speeches
[03:06:37.580 --> 03:06:39.020]   not only in American history,
[03:06:39.020 --> 03:06:41.060]   but in the history of the world.
[03:06:41.060 --> 03:06:44.100]   You know, there's a tendency now for people
[03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.440]   to sort of poo-poo that speech.
[03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:50.700]   I think, unfortunately, the speech, you know,
[03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:55.700]   has been embraced by, you know, advertisers
[03:06:55.700 --> 03:06:56.820]   in corporate America.
[03:06:56.820 --> 03:07:01.380]   It's been so, you know, it's been heard so many times
[03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:04.300]   that it sort of has been made to suffer
[03:07:04.300 --> 03:07:07.780]   from what some people might view as overexposure.
[03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:09.220]   - It's so unfortunate, I mean--
[03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:10.220]   - It's too bad.
[03:07:10.220 --> 03:07:12.860]   - Especially when Hollywood rolls in.
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:16.540]   They did that with John Lennon's "Imagine" recently,
[03:07:16.540 --> 03:07:18.900]   which I think is one of the greatest songs ever,
[03:07:18.900 --> 03:07:21.460]   and the actors and actresses ruined it
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:22.760]   by trying to like sing along
[03:07:22.760 --> 03:07:25.100]   and do this kind of cliche Hollywood thing.
[03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:28.120]   - It has, but people have tried to make it into a cliche.
[03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:33.120]   The fact of the matter is it's the sentiment,
[03:07:33.340 --> 03:07:36.940]   the sentiment behind "I Have a Dream,"
[03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:39.740]   yeah, I'll associate myself with that.
[03:07:39.740 --> 03:07:44.740]   And anybody wants to see some great oratory, go watch.
[03:07:44.740 --> 03:07:51.140]   And, you know, Martin Luther King Jr.,
[03:07:51.140 --> 03:07:56.140]   I mean, he gave, you know, several great speeches.
[03:07:56.140 --> 03:08:01.880]   You know, his first speech, the first speech that he gave
[03:08:01.880 --> 03:08:06.140]   as a civil rights leader,
[03:08:06.140 --> 03:08:11.560]   the Holt Street Baptist Church, 1955,
[03:08:11.560 --> 03:08:15.020]   at the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott,
[03:08:15.020 --> 03:08:18.180]   which was virtually an extemporaneous speech,
[03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:20.020]   was one of his greatest.
[03:08:20.020 --> 03:08:24.180]   And he was, I think, 26 years old, great.
[03:08:24.180 --> 03:08:26.380]   His last speech, you know,
[03:08:26.380 --> 03:08:28.180]   his mountaintop speech, great speech,
[03:08:28.180 --> 03:08:30.820]   but "I Have a Dream," I love it.
[03:08:31.760 --> 03:08:34.680]   I will associate myself with those sentiments
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:36.760]   any day of the week, absolutely.
[03:08:36.760 --> 03:08:41.760]   - So you still have hope for a deep kind of multiracial,
[03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:44.880]   a deep unity in the 21st century?
[03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:48.820]   - I have that hope, and I think that the sentiments
[03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:53.820]   that Martin Luther King Jr. expressed in August 1963,
[03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:59.680]   that represents the best of American life.
[03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:05.520]   And I think it's a, you know,
[03:09:05.520 --> 03:09:08.620]   do I want to see that come to pass?
[03:09:08.620 --> 03:09:10.500]   Yeah, I want to see that come to pass,
[03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:15.380]   and we'll work to, you know, push that project along
[03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:17.180]   as far as it'll go.
[03:09:17.180 --> 03:09:20.060]   - Well, thank you for carrying his spirit
[03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:23.700]   of optimism forward, the spirit of your mother and father.
[03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:25.300]   Thank you for all the amazing work you've done,
[03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:28.020]   and thank you for just, this conversation's a huge honor.
[03:09:28.020 --> 03:09:28.860]   This is awesome. - Thank you.
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:30.260]   - Really appreciate it. - Thank you.
[03:09:30.260 --> 03:09:32.020]   Thank you, Randall.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:33.500]   Thanks for listening to this conversation

[03:09:40.540 --> 03:09:42.860]   from Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:09:42.860 --> 03:09:45.060]   Darkness cannot drive out darkness.
[03:09:45.060 --> 03:09:47.220]   Only light can do that.
[03:09:47.220 --> 03:09:49.880]   Hate cannot drive out hate.
[03:09:49.880 --> 03:09:51.780]   Only love can do that.
