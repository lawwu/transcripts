[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.760]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.440]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.840]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.200]   and if you've been thinking about planning
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.720]   the perfect getaway to Mexico,
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.880]   or maybe you haven't, but now you're intrigued,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.300]   you're gonna love this episode,
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.840]   because we've got Zach Rabinor, founder of Journey Mexico,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420]   who has dedicated his career
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700]   to curating unforgettable experiences
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.680]   in one of the world's most mesmerizing destinations.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.840]   We'll cover the main places you already know,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720]   as well as places you didn't even realize
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.520]   you wanted to go, the best times to travel,
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.880]   ways to get around the country,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.560]   some hidden gems, must-try eats, and so much more.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.760]   Then after, I'll cover some tips and tricks
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.080]   for getting the best deals for your next trip.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.260]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.680]   If you've been listening to this podcast for a while,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.760]   you know that I'm a huge fan of our sponsor today, Daffy,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.920]   and their mission to help people
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   be more generous more often.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.880]   Daffy is a platform and app that helps regular folks
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.340]   like you and me manage giving
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.760]   to the charities we care about more efficiently,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.380]   and they do that by helping you set up
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.240]   a special tax-advantaged account
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.880]   called a donor-advised fund, or DAF.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.040]   Amy and I love Daffy, and we've been using it
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.480]   for all the causes we support for nearly two years now.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.240]   Daffy is the lowest-cost DAF provider around,
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.640]   and whether you're giving a few hundred dollars to charity
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120]   or hundreds of thousands, they make it possible
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.560]   to give and grow your donations through a simple mobile app.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.640]   Donor-advised funds like Daffy are awesome
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.200]   because they're convenient.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.120]   All the giving records and donation receipts
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.980]   are organized in one place.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.280]   They're tax-efficient.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.640]   With a DAF like Daffy, you can grow your donations tax-free,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.520]   and you can also donate assets like appreciated stock,
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.640]   index funds, and crypto to avoid capital gains.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760]   And finally, they're on autopilot.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.080]   Daffy manages automatic contributions
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   so that we can all hit our annual goals for giving.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.060]   So to give more regularly, even at small amounts,
[00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.480]   or to just have a better system for giving,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.920]   head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   And for a limited time, you can get a free $25
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.620]   to give to the charity of your choice at that link,
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.620]   which again is allthehacks.com/daffy, D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.720]   Zach, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.200]   - Great to be here, thanks for having me.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.160]   - So I think Mexico is a very different travel destination
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.220]   than all the ones we've done before,
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.240]   which all have you cross an ocean.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.640]   I was thinking about how I would describe
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.480]   an itinerary to a foreign country.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   And often it's thinking, oh, I'm gonna go to this place
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.400]   for two weeks and try to fit the whole country in.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.500]   Mexico feels so close to home
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.560]   for people living in the US and Canada
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.580]   that you might approach it differently.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.520]   I think I'll just start by kicking off.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.800]   How do you think people should be thinking about Mexico
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.640]   as a travel destination,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.880]   given that we might all have
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.560]   a lot of different preconceived notions?
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.480]   - Sure, well, you hit it on the head.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.720]   We see a real dichotomy in the way
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.400]   that people travel through Mexico,
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.740]   the longer haul origin markets, right?
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.520]   So if you're coming from the UK or Europe
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.960]   or further afield, you'd come for at least two weeks
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.440]   and often three or four weeks,
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.240]   and you'd treat it as a once in a lifetime trip.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.640]   You'd travel all over, you'd go from north to south,
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.880]   you'd visit the cultural centers, the beaches,
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   and all the diversity that Mexico has,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680]   or at least as much of it as you can fit in
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.920]   in the time you have.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.760]   For North Americans and Mexicans as well,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.400]   Mexico is a repeat destination, right?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.840]   It's really close, it's a really unique destination
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.480]   in that it's close to home, it's familiar, but it's exotic.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.640]   You've got a different language,
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.840]   you've got different customs,
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720]   you've got different cultures, different history,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.420]   especially for North Americans.
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.200]   So yes, you often would travel
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.680]   for a long weekend or a week max, right?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.320]   And you would come back,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.720]   perhaps one type of trip would be sun and sand,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.360]   the beach, you know, get out of the cold,
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.160]   the winters are long in North America.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.440]   And we do see incredible correlations
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   of spikes in bookings when those first cold fronts come
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.520]   and the first snowfalls come,
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.840]   and all of a sudden, boom, you know, we see bookings spike.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.200]   But then there's also the cultural side of Mexico.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.880]   Mexico City has been so popular recently,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.160]   San Miguel de Allende, Oaxaca,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880]   the Yucatan Peninsula, Merida, there's a lot.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   So I think there's two decidedly different ways
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.600]   to travel in Mexico for the closer to home trips
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.480]   in North Americans and Mexicans as well,
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   which would be either your typical sun and sand type of trip
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.760]   or your more cultural trip.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840]   And yes, Mexico certainly is a repeat destination
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.880]   that people come back to over and over again.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.520]   - You mentioned a lot of places,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.040]   you just broke it up pretty easily into two.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.680]   How do you think within there
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.400]   about even trying to process all of these options?
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.560]   I imagine someone on the East Coast is probably like,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.000]   well, I've probably been to Cancun
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and someone on the West Coast is like,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.080]   I've been to Cabo and maybe been to Mexico City
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.120]   or Puerto Vallarta, but there's so much more.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.320]   How do you start to break it down
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.680]   for someone who's like, I have a week,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.560]   I wanna think about it, what should I do?
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.320]   - Sure, well, absolutely, people are very interested,
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.200]   especially when it's a short haul trip,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.600]   they want direct flights.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.560]   So you start looking at flight access
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.480]   and you ask people, don't tell me where you wanna go,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.080]   tell me what you envision, what do you wanna do?
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.320]   What hat do you have on?
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.040]   Do you have your beach lounging hat and escape the cold hat?
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.320]   Do you have your culinary hat on?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.960]   Do you have your history and culture and art hat on?
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.600]   So really listen to someone about what it is
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.560]   they wanna do and then try to direct them towards,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.360]   or at least explain the different options
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.920]   and what there is to do and what type of experiences
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.480]   there are in different destinations.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   - Are there a few places that stand out in your mind,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.760]   you're like, I don't know why these places
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.200]   don't get the credit that some
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.080]   of these other more popular places get,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.280]   but they probably should?
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.200]   - Sure, I mean, my mission with Journey Mexico
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.240]   was to share the beyond the beach destinations.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.160]   And it's interesting, through the pandemic,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.000]   we've seen a lot more focus on a lot of the more cultural,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.640]   more off the beaten path, more remote destinations.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.400]   But I always wondered why people had never been
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.040]   to Mexico City or people had never been to Oaxaca,
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.280]   people hadn't been to Chiapas or the Yucatan Peninsula
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   like Merida, the Haciendas, Campeche.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.480]   These are all incredibly culturally,
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.040]   historically rich destinations
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.160]   that people often hadn't heard about.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.440]   During the pandemic, when people couldn't go
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.760]   and get their Italy fix or their safari fix
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.600]   or their Far East fix,
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.880]   or these kinds of more exotic destinations,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.040]   people really started exploring Mexico
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.680]   in ways they hadn't before.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.240]   So that was a great silver lining, if you will,
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.480]   of the pandemic is that Mexico saw a lot of people
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   in destinations that they hadn't seen before.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.480]   - And what is it about Mexico?
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.040]   I mean, you started an entire company
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.400]   dedicated to the country.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.920]   What about Mexico do you think is so special?
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.240]   - I had worked as a tour leader and a guide.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.400]   This was on the back of just exploring and backpacking
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.880]   and being a mountaineer and a surfer.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.240]   And as I led people through these destinations,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.040]   I was fascinated and I covered all of Latin America, right?
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.960]   So I was leading tours to Mexico, Central America,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.400]   South America, and in particular, Mexico blew me away
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.280]   because I too had the stereotypes
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.520]   and traveled to Club Med as a child with my family.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.840]   And all of a sudden we were in these incredible
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.200]   UNESCO World Heritage cities, the architecture, the food,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   the culture, the history, the archeological sites,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.200]   the people, it really blew me away.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.040]   And that's where the light bulb went off.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.800]   And I said, this is an untapped resource.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.120]   This is a treasure.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.480]   So that was the inspiration.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.080]   - And a treasure that for, you know,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.320]   the majority of people listening to this show
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.640]   is much cheaper and easier to get to
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.400]   than a lot of other places in the world.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.680]   - You make such a good point there.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.160]   I said it before, it's close enough and familiar enough,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.000]   but exotic enough and far away enough.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   So that's right.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.520]   It's got so many compelling reasons to visit,
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.640]   not the least of which is the proximity, the value.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.240]   When I say value, I'm not saying it's a cheap destination.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.640]   Everyone who's been to Mexico recently,
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.920]   especially will attest to the fact that
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.440]   it's not the cheapest destination,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.560]   although the whole world seems to be a little wacky
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.240]   in terms of prices these days.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.960]   But the service you get, you know,
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.800]   apples to apples, pound for pound, Mexico,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.480]   especially when you look at the competitive set
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.640]   in sun and sand terms, right?
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.520]   Often people are considering a beach holiday
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.880]   over Christmas or New Year's.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   I'm either going to Hawaii, Mexico, or the Caribbean.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.680]   You know, that's kind of the competitive set.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.280]   And not only the value you get
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.000]   in terms of the quality of the hotel
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.600]   or the experiences, but the service.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.720]   I think that's where really the difference is stark
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.120]   is Mexico is such a hospitable country.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.040]   The culture is so hospitable.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.640]   Mexican culture is so warm.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.960]   It takes two seconds before someone's inviting you
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.600]   into their home, inviting you for a drink, a meal.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.760]   You know, a very common expression is
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.520]   My house is your house.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.760]   So I think that that's where it just really
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.840]   goes off the chart in terms of value.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   You're getting better product,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   you're getting more for your money,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.400]   and you're getting far superior service
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.280]   than you would get in almost anywhere in the world.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.040]   - And for someone who just heard that expression, right?
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.600]   You know, the idea of getting invited to someone's home.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.480]   To me, that seems a little foreign,
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.160]   having been focused most of my trips to Mexico,
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.920]   maybe more like your childhood,
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   where it's Cabo or Cancun at a resort with family.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.640]   Is that something that you think people visiting
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   might actually experience if they just got off
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.120]   that kind of standard track?
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.200]   Because it feels a little foreign to think about it.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.040]   - Absolutely.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.720]   That's, again, part of our mission is
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   I can't encourage people enough to get out of the hotel,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.080]   to go and visit archeological sites,
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.080]   to interact with the locals,
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.000]   even if that means having a local guide
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.960]   or, you know, it's not always that easy, right?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.680]   Especially if you're not fluent in Spanish
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.320]   or you don't have someone who you know
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.600]   or friends in the country.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.640]   But that said, I think, yes,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   getting out of the hotel, opening your eyes,
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.440]   even speaking to the taxi drivers
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.960]   or your transfer driver or the people in a store,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.160]   you'll really find an incredible warmth
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.040]   and you'll find invitations do flow freely.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   - And do you think Spanish becomes more necessary
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.160]   the further away you get?
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   How much of the country's ability to speak English
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   is focused just on kind of hospitality
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.240]   and major tourist destinations?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.920]   - Tourism is a tremendous and important
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.360]   revenue generator for Mexico.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.760]   And so, obviously, that's another part,
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.720]   by the way, of the services.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.160]   Mexico has had real professional-level tourism
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.560]   and travel for 70, 80 years now.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.600]   You know, it's well ahead of a lot of Latin America
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.000]   in terms of the development
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.240]   and the maturity of its tourism market.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.800]   So you really do have incredible human infrastructure, right?
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.360]   The people are well-trained, they're professional,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.280]   they're second, third, fourth generation
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.560]   hospitality professionals.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.880]   So you will find a lot of English.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   However, you get off the beaten path,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.280]   and I mean, even in Cancun or Los Cabos or Puerto Vallarta,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.360]   you know, you step into a convenience store
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.600]   and the clerks are not speaking English, right?
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.800]   So Spanish is an incredibly valuable tool.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.880]   I can't stress enough, whether it's Mexico
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   or wherever you may travel,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.360]   how valuable and how important it can be
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.520]   to know even just a few words.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.800]   And of course, more is better.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.200]   But yeah, certainly for me,
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.040]   what led me into the tourism field was my travels
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.120]   and then my fascination with the culture
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.240]   and then a real focus and a real passion
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.080]   for learning Spanish language.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.440]   I ended up getting a master's degree
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.160]   in international affairs
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.400]   and being able to penetrate and get into the culture
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.000]   and be able to converse and interact
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.240]   with people in their own language.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.640]   That's a whole nother level of interchange
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.120]   and of sharing that you can do.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.440]   - For anyone who didn't check out,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.680]   we did an episode recently
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.680]   with Benny Lewis, "Fluent in Three Months."
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.760]   And we talked a ton about, you know,
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.320]   both becoming fluent,
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.520]   but also just like crash-coursing yourself
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:02.360]   in a language in a short period of time
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.880]   and effective ways to do that.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.160]   So if someone listening is thinking,
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.920]   "Gosh, I took Spanish in school.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.240]   "I need to brush up."
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.760]   There's some good tips in that episode
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.840]   to go back and check out.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.480]   So I wanna jump into a few regions,
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.760]   but before that, talk generally about getting around.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.520]   You know, you mentioned people target places
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.240]   with direct flights.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.560]   What's it like to actually get around
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.200]   outside of the main hubs in Mexico
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.480]   when it comes to transportation?
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.360]   - There's all kinds of transportation
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.840]   to the most remote places in Mexico
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.000]   from very modern buses.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.720]   Of course, you've got taxis,
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   you've got even some trains like in the Copper Canyon
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.920]   and some other areas.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.640]   You've got internal flights
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.600]   that you can hub and spoke at a Mexico City
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.360]   or Guadalajara or Monterrey,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.560]   but all kinds of very good and constant transportation,
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.400]   very frequent, regularly running.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.080]   You've got ferries, you've got boats,
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   you've got all kinds of stuff.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.640]   Remember, the large majority of the population
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.400]   does not have a car.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.760]   So they are using public transportation.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.200]   And then you can rent vehicles, you can contract vehicles.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.720]   Our company organizes transportation, of course,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.680]   but there's loads of ways to use public transportation
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.840]   and it's very effective, efficient, and cheap.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.640]   - And when it comes to timing throughout the year,
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.720]   are there times to avoid
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.080]   or times to you think Mexico really shines?
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.320]   I know Caribbean has like rainy season.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.280]   Is there, how would you tell someone to think about
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.160]   when to plan a trip?
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.520]   I imagine there'll be people that end this episode
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.160]   and think, I've always thought of Mexico in one way.
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.520]   I now think of it in a new way
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   and I'm ready to go experience that.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.760]   When should they be thinking about it?
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.360]   - I think anybody who has true flexibility
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.880]   and freedom with when they travel
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.000]   should target non-peak periods.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.360]   I mean, that's obvious, right?
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.480]   That's a no brainer if you can.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.560]   The peak periods are gonna be the most crowded.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.480]   They're gonna be the most expensive.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.560]   They're gonna be a hassle in general, right?
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.160]   And then you look at rainy season.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.320]   When's the weather best?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   So you've got in general,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.520]   rainy and dry season throughout all of Mexico.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.320]   The rainy season spans from about June through October
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.160]   with the worst of it being late August into late October.
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.000]   And so you probably wanna avoid that.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.160]   But even the early parts of the rainy season,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.720]   June, July, even early August,
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.640]   we kind of look at it as the green season.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.160]   It's lower prices.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.080]   I think that's a travel hack, if you will.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.160]   What most people think is rainy season,
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   but it only has a little bit of thundershowers
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.000]   in the late afternoon.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.520]   But generally, you've got nice weather
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.680]   and much better prices, less people, more availability.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.920]   And that goes for everything, right?
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.720]   It's not just the hotels.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.160]   It's guides, it's in the archeological sites,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.240]   Mexico City restaurants,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.720]   seen everybody's after these iconic restaurants.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.400]   So I would say those are great months.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.280]   Also, I love November.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.280]   November's a great month outside of Thanksgiving week,
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.320]   which is a peak little week there.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.880]   But otherwise, all the way into early December,
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.160]   before the Christmas rush,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.440]   you can find great values and the same deal.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.760]   You've got good weather.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   You've got great availability.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.560]   You can get into the restaurants.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.960]   Traffic is more mellow.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.440]   And then you really have to go destination by destination.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.000]   Like we've seen a real uptick in travel to Mexico City
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.800]   over Christmas and New Year's.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.840]   In the beginning, people thought,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.280]   well, I don't really wanna visit
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.440]   because a lot of Mexico City shuts down.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.900]   But that also means you don't have
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.200]   the crazy chaotic traffic, right?
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.240]   You can get around, it's more mellow.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.400]   Sure, I mean, maybe one or two restaurants
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.160]   or clothes that you wanted to go to or an attraction,
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.440]   but the calmer pace in a very chaotic city
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.960]   is very attractive to people.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.840]   Yeah, I think that those are some good
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.040]   kind of insider tips on when.
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.560]   - We did a trip as a family.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.900]   Well, we planned a trip as a family
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.840]   to Mexico City over Christmas.
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.420]   And for whatever reason, everyone in our family bailed.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.600]   And so my wife and I just went, the two of us,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.360]   and I give my full endorsement to that time of year.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.760]   Restaurants might've been closed a day or two,
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.080]   but it wasn't impossible to get incredible meals.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.520]   - I love helping you answer all the toughest questions
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.020]   about life, money, and so much more.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.600]   But sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.260]   in your situation, which actually gets harder
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.640]   as you build your wealth.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   So I wanna introduce you to today's sponsor, Long Angle.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.760]   Long Angle is a community of high net worth individuals
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.920]   with backgrounds in everything from technology,
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.000]   finance, medicine, to real estate,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.440]   law, manufacturing, and more.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.840]   I'm a member of Long Angle.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.800]   I've loved being a part of the community,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.120]   and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.260]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.600]   to talk about alternative investments.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.320]   Now, the majority of Long Angle members
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.120]   are first generation wealth,
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.200]   young, highly successful individuals
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.360]   who join the community to share knowledge
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.680]   and learn from each other
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.280]   in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.560]   On top of that, members also get access
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.300]   Like I said, I'm a member,
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.460]   and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.440]   because you're getting advice and feedback
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.920]   from people in a similar situation to you
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.360]   on everything from your investment portfolio
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.000]   to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.480]   So many of these conversations
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.680]   aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.200]   which is their minimum for membership,
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.280]   I encourage you to check out Long Angle,
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.400]   and it's totally free to join.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.560]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more,
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.060]   and if you choose to apply,
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.000]   be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.100]   Again, that's longangle, A-N-G-L-E, .com.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.960]   Missing an ingredient for that amazing recipe you're making?
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.320]   Or maybe you just ran out of milk or bread?
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.240]   Well, with DoorDash Grocery Delivery,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.760]   you can get what you want right when you need it,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.640]   for this episode.
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.880]   With thousands of grocery stores to choose from,
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.880]   you'll find the best in your neighborhood,
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   and with easy substitutions right in the app
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.380]   and best-in-class customer support,
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.240]   DoorDash will deliver groceries exactly how you want,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.200]   and if that's not the case, DoorDash will make it right.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   And if you want even more value,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.560]   you can save on all your grocery and restaurant favorites
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.280]   with a $0 delivery fee on eligible orders
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.860]   with a DashPass membership,
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.800]   which you can actually get free with many chase cards
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.240]   like the Sapphire Preferred or Reserve.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.560]   Get 50% off your DoorDash order up to $20 value
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.040]   when you use code A-T-H-FALL at checkout.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.120]   Limited time offer, terms apply.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.680]   That's 50% off up to $20, no minimum subtotal,
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.380]   and zero delivery fees on your first order
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.560]   when you download the DoorDash app in the App Store
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.040]   and enter code A-T-H-FALL.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.200]   That's A-T-H for all the hacks.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.300]   Don't forget, that's code A-T-H-FALL
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.720]   for 50% off your first order with DoorDash.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.640]   I think for people who probably haven't been
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   to Mexico City or really left major tourist hotels and stuff,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.680]   how would you describe Mexican food?
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.280]   Because I feel like there's American Mexican food,
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.360]   there's Tex-Mex, and when you're truly in Mexico
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   and experiencing everything, how different is it?
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.600]   Sure, that's a great question.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.040]   And there's not an easy answer to that
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.200]   because Mexico, like the U.S., is a vast country,
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.320]   really big, and cuisine is very regionalized.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.440]   So the food you get in Baja California is very different
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.480]   than the food you're gonna find in the Yucatan.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.600]   There are some commonalities, right?
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   You've got the staple ingredients of corn,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.000]   chili peppers, tomatoes, lime,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.860]   that you can find ubiquitously, it's everywhere.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.200]   But the preparation, you've got regional specialties.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.080]   You know, the tlayudas of Oaxaca,
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   you've got panuchos in the Southeast, in the Yucatan.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   Mexico City's famous for its tacos.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.880]   You've got a special way of preparing fish and shrimp
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.280]   in Baja California.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.560]   So I always say having a bad meal is a sin in Mexico
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.080]   because the food is so good.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.760]   You know, it's like having a bad meal in Italy.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.040]   You've really gotta have bad luck or really screw it up.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.240]   But Mexico, the cuisine is so good.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.200]   We were the third country in the world,
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.640]   after France and Italy, to be declared
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.480]   a UNESCO World Heritage Site for our gastronomy,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.880]   for our cuisine, and that's an intangible heritage
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.680]   of Mexico, and you can read more about that.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.480]   But so interesting, the food is just amazing.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.240]   It's one of the most visible, the most obvious things
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.660]   that I miss when I'm traveling out of Mexico,
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.400]   it's just heavenly, it's amazing.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.200]   - If you were just randomly transplanted
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.000]   to a city in Mexico and you had to find
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.120]   the best restaurant with no knowledge,
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.800]   are there ways to get that information?
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.200]   I feel like asking someone, especially as a foreigner,
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.160]   can often lead to, well, let me take you to this place
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.520]   that maybe I'd make some money for sending you to.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.380]   How would you suggest people find great places to eat?
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.400]   - Well, first of all, absolutely, what you said is true.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.720]   I think it's important to slow people down
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.360]   and really ask them, no, don't tell me where I should eat.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.200]   Where do you eat?
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.800]   Where do you go when you have day off
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.600]   and you're gonna take the family for a nice big lunch?
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.120]   And by the way, that's another important thing
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.080]   to keep in mind.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.560]   Mexico, the important meal is the lunch.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.920]   It's not dinner like we do in North America, right?
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.360]   So where do you take your family for lunch?
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.500]   And also be specific, like we like seafood
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.760]   or we'd like tacos or we'd like certain types of meal.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.720]   What's your preference in terms of different foods?
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.120]   But yeah, urging people, stop your stock answer
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.520]   or where you might make a commission,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.360]   but where do you go?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.560]   Where do you go for the best taco or the best lunch spot
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.360]   or the best seafood or whatever it is
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.760]   that you have a hankering for?
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.440]   - And is there any website or app that Mexicans are using
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.120]   to rate and review places that might be helpful?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.960]   - That's interesting.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.960]   I never thought of that because it's so ubiquitous
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.880]   in the U.S. and in the rest of the world.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.200]   It's not as common because it's all word of mouth.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.000]   We have restaurant guides that we put out
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.520]   and so you can find them on our website.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.640]   But yeah, I think that asking locals,
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.800]   and this is really interesting,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.720]   as the world becomes more commoditized
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.440]   and as you've got AI,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.040]   you've got access to so much information,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   getting those recommendations from people you really trust
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.920]   and you feel like you share the same taste with,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.520]   that's real gold and getting those recommendations.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.040]   And not just what's the most famous restaurant
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.960]   in Mexico City, but the little hole-in-the-wall places,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.600]   the under-the-radar places,
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.160]   and also the places that are still good, right?
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.800]   It was not just that it was good yesterday,
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.200]   but is it still good today, right?
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.120]   That's the type of local knowledge that's really valuable.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.540]   - And in general, two kind of logistics,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.240]   from a timing and reservation perspective,
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.600]   how should people think about going out to eat?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.920]   - Listen, if you go to Mexico City,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.480]   you gotta get on that.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.880]   If you're interested in the iconic,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.260]   super sought after reservations,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.880]   you should be making your restaurant reservations
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.440]   when you make your hotel reservations,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.120]   even if that's months out.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.000]   Otherwise, it's really difficult to get a bad meal.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.440]   I mean, there's so much good food.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.740]   I don't think you have to worry much.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.080]   There are no Michelin star rated restaurants in Mexico,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.680]   which is laughable to me.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.880]   But if you want the iconic best of the best in Mexico City,
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.920]   or even in Oaxaca or perhaps Merida,
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.560]   it's good to make those reservations early,
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.960]   especially in Mexico City.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.720]   - And timing wise, what time do people eat dinner?
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.200]   And I feel like I've gone and I don't remember.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.500]   Is there a hack, you know,
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.140]   if you wanna get into some of these places,
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.760]   go a little earlier, go a little late?
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.600]   - For sure.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.860]   Mexico City and Mexico in general,
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.840]   dinner is typically not eaten before eight o'clock at night
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.160]   and often as late as 10.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.920]   Lunch doesn't begin until two
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   and can often be eaten as late as four.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.400]   So it's very much in the Spanish tradition.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.760]   You've got the siesta, people often leave for lunch
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.840]   and don't come back.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.800]   So it's a much later cycle.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.220]   So a good hack is eating earlier.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.060]   Absolutely.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.320]   If you're okay with eating dinner at 6 p.m.,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.880]   as long as the place is open,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.440]   you may have to wait for them to get the grill fired up.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.760]   But yeah, that's a good way to go about it.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   - You know, I keep thinking back to that recommendation
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.760]   you gave in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.800]   I'm literally gonna go there for dinner.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.760]   And so I'm gonna push back a little
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.520]   since I know you put together a few things in advance.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.840]   Maybe give people a couple places,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.600]   even just one in a few areas
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.760]   that would just really top off a trip
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.160]   in the food, drink, cafe area.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.760]   - It's so vast, right?
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:05.640]   But there are these gems that really stand out to me
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.620]   and it's so rich
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.440]   and there's such a range of different types of things.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.620]   But Mexico City in particular,
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.640]   you know, the street food and the tacos
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.760]   and it all changes, right?
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.240]   So definitely before you go,
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.080]   check back in with me.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.060]   Need to make sure that it's still putting out the goods.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:23.960]   But El Venadito, which is carnitas in San Angel,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.200]   you literally eat standing up outside,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:28.920]   but it's the best carnitas tacos you'll ever have.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   Carnitas are fried pork and pork rinds.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.280]   Also the Tacos Moran, which is the suadero,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.720]   that's in San Miguel, Chapultepec.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.000]   Those are two amazing taquerias.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.320]   I was also thinking about in Oaxaca,
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.920]   this little trendy place
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.520]   that we just went to, Levadura de Olla.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.760]   Check that out.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.960]   And then a really local place is called La Teca.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.340]   You know, really locals only,
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.620]   kind of hole in the wall, but just delicious.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.020]   I mean, I actually dream about the mole that I had there.
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.260]   And there are places like this all over,
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.780]   Merida, Riviera Maya.
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.580]   You know, you were talking about Cancun.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.060]   Right outside of Playa del Carmen,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.180]   there's a place called Cocos Cabañas,
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.820]   about seven miles north of Playa del Carmen.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.800]   It's owned by this Swiss-Mexican couple.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.260]   And our operations manager, who lives in Playa,
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.460]   she's Swiss, so she probably has an affinity
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.980]   for the Swiss-Mexican combo, but just beautiful.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.300]   A mixture of like European and Mexican.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.620]   Everywhere you go, there's such a plethora
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.860]   of amazing places from high cuisine to tacos on the street.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.300]   Interestingly, that's the trend lately,
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.260]   is people wanna eat at Pujol, which is Enrique Olvera,
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.980]   Mexico's most celebrated chef, Michelin star,
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.060]   if Mexico had Michelin stars.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.980]   And the next day, they wanna eat tacos on the street,
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.980]   like standing up and dripping taco juice on their shoes.
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.420]   So, you know, let me know when you go
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.980]   and we'll fill you in on all the little details.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.060]   But there's so much and it's always changing.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.160]   It's a moving target.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.900]   It's so much fun keeping on top of it.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.320]   - I haven't had lunch yet, so I am very excited
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.700]   to eat just in general,
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.500]   but even more excited for the next trip.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.340]   - That's awesome.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:05.740]   - So what I think would be helpful,
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.380]   you've divided into two broad regions,
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.580]   vacation, sun, beach, and kind of more heritage.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.740]   And I don't know if Mexico City falls in heritage
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:17.100]   or a third category on its own, but let's pick those three.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.700]   Let's start in beach and relaxation
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.460]   and maybe hit on some of the favorites and the highlights
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.820]   from your perspective,
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.100]   where people wanting that kind of trip should look.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.180]   Both, if it's a place that they've heard of,
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.180]   but still worth going,
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.240]   I'm hoping to maybe hear of a place
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.540]   I've not considered for that experience.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.420]   - So there's the big three these days,
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.740]   at least for international tourists,
[00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.300]   which are Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta,
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.340]   couple that with Punta de Mita,
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.140]   and Cancun, Riviera Maya, all the way down to Tulum.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.620]   Right, those are the three big beach destinations.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.100]   Acapulco used to be in that category
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.740]   and it's since fell out of favor, at least internationally,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.340]   a big destination for people from Mexico City
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.540]   and within Mexico.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.340]   But there are more off the beaten path destinations.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.860]   And I think that's very much in high demand these days.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.300]   People wanna know what's the next Tulum, right?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.700]   So you've got places like Sayulita,
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.020]   you've got Puerto Escondido on the Pacific coast.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.940]   I think quite a bit of the Pacific coast
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.660]   is still relatively unexplored.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.380]   You've got Ixtapacihuatanejo, which is lesser visited,
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.580]   more popular than these kind of very little fishing towns.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.860]   At Todos Santos in Southern Baja
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.540]   is another place that people are keen on
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.140]   looking for off the beaten path,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.980]   smaller beach destinations.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.540]   Even going further than Tulum, down to Bacalar,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.420]   which is down all the way towards Chetumal,
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.360]   that's another interesting spot
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.620]   that's just starting to be noticed.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.780]   Those are a few of the lesser visited sun and sand.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.460]   - How would you compare the three more visited
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.580]   for someone's like, I'm going to Mexico, I wanna beach.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.940]   It's funny 'cause I've been to all three
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.660]   and I don't know if I have the right answer.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.660]   So if someone asked me,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.540]   I'm hoping I now have a place to send them to compare.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.380]   - Sure.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.980]   In broad strokes, you've got the Caribbean,
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.300]   which is this turquoise water, this fine white sand.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.620]   If you're a snorkeler, scuba diver, this is heaven.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.660]   That said, it's also the most visited, right?
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.580]   So the Cancun airport gets flights from,
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.380]   well, it did get flights from Moscow,
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.260]   not quite so much anymore.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:17.820]   But from very far flung international destinations,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.920]   thousands of flights landing and taking off daily.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.400]   And it's crowded, it's busy, it's commercial.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.200]   So you really have to dig there, right?
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.400]   Get out of Cancun, used to be Playa del Carmen,
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.800]   now Playa del Carmen, it's full.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.740]   You go down to Tulum.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.740]   Tulum seems to be a bit overcooked at this point as well.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.500]   So you've really got to kind of dig
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   and find little off the beaten path places
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.060]   to find any kind of peace and quiet
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.160]   or more relaxed atmosphere.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.660]   - Quick question, where does Cozumel fit in there?
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.180]   My wife went as a child every year
[00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.940]   and neither one of us have been there in a decade
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.980]   and you didn't mention it, so I thought I'd just ask.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.060]   - Cozumel is a big dive spot
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.980]   and it's also a huge cruise port.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.340]   So that is what dominates Cozumel travel and tourism.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:02.700]   I don't know if your wife's family were divers.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.120]   There you go, yep.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.940]   Yeah, and then you've got Isla Mujeres,
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.180]   you've got a bunch of little different Puerto Morelos.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.680]   There's little spots that you can try and hit.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.520]   So it's important to dig a little further.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.880]   Then you've got Puerto Vallarta.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.380]   I would say Puerto Vallarta
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.880]   is probably the most traditional beach destination.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.960]   That's where I've lived for the last 16 years.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.240]   There's a colonial historical center.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.920]   It had an economic life and historical life
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.200]   before tourism and travel came.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.160]   Tourism and travel came back in the '50s.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.200]   If you remember Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton film,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.420]   "The Night of the Iguana" there.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.360]   So it's been on the radar.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.320]   It kinda was a jet setty type of destination
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.000]   back when Acapulco had fame
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.720]   and it still really retains a lot of local charm.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.160]   One of the things that I love about Puerto Vallarta
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.900]   is the initial waves of travelers and tourists
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.440]   that came and even settled there
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.840]   were largely North Americans, also some Europeans,
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.040]   that came to live like Mexicans.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.400]   They put on their huaraches, their traditional sandals,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.820]   and got their little bag and went to the market
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.300]   and they were very respectful
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.880]   and created a very symbiotic type of relationship
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.820]   with the local people.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.960]   So that in turn created a very kind,
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.760]   generous, open-hearted outlook
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   from the locals towards the tourists
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.880]   and towards the settlers, right?
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.920]   And we found that as a family living in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.200]   Cancun, on the other hand, really was an invention, right?
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.400]   It was a business operation.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.040]   They saw the potential.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.520]   They came in, Fonatur, and created Cancun
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.240]   with the sole purpose of bringing travelers there
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.500]   and it was literally wetlands and mangroves
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.720]   and there was no community there, right?
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.560]   So everything is imported, including even the locals.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.940]   There's no real locals.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.280]   There's a few local fishing
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.800]   and it was more migrant, right?
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.280]   Seasonal fishing.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.920]   So you feel that difference very starkly.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.800]   You've got traditional architecture
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.520]   and it reflects in the food as well.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.760]   When we talk later
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.740]   about the more cultural heritage destinations,
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.960]   people often ask me to compare San Miguel Allende and Oaxaca
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.960]   and not to detour too far off what we're talking about.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.400]   So Oaxaca has a lot of indigenous,
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.000]   pre-Columbian culture, history, people.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.920]   And so that influences the food and the culture
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   and the history and the clothing
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   and the language and everything.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.040]   It's the same way with Puerto Vallarta.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.080]   You've got more of a historical,
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.400]   you have more roots there.
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.560]   And that shows through in the food, in the architecture,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.200]   in the history, in the culture,
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.500]   and also the sense of pride that the local people have
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.320]   about their own hometown.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.920]   So that's Puerto Vallarta.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.280]   Los Cabos is really the new kid on the block.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.240]   You know, the Baja Peninsula was considered
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.320]   literally an island for a long time.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.520]   We're talking historically, right?
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.600]   Back in the 16 and 1700s,
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.140]   before people realized it was connected
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.880]   all the way up at the border with it.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.860]   Well, I guess it was still part of Mexico,
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.880]   all of the Southwest of the United States.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.800]   But in that sense, it's very removed.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.880]   It's very expensive, Baja, because of the same reasons,
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.880]   right, you have to import everything.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.060]   A lot of the products and even the history and the culture
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.040]   come from North America, not from the mainland of Mexico.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.120]   But Los Cabos, yeah, is new and glitzy and shiny and fancy
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.160]   and definitely more expensive,
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.400]   but it's also got a very high level
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.880]   in terms of quality, of service.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.280]   And many people say that it really does feel
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.960]   almost like an extension of Southern California.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.620]   And you know, you had Baja California, Baja Sur,
[00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.240]   and this was just lower California.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.920]   And you still feel a lot of North American influence there.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.180]   I'd also add to that, just geographically,
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.780]   it's this very stark desert contrasted
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.900]   by this sparkling, dazzling Sea of Cortez
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.580]   and the Pacific Ocean.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.420]   So that juxtaposition of the desert
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.140]   with this deep blue Pacific
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.740]   and the sparkling, dazzling blue Sea of Cortez.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.260]   And the Sea of Cortez in itself is worth mentioning.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.820]   This is what Jacques Cousteau called the world's aquarium.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.300]   So this is like a Galapagos level
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.100]   marine wildlife environment.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.580]   So there's a lot there.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.780]   - So before we move on from beach,
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.740]   I wanna think there's probably some high percentage
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.500]   of the audience who's going to, in the next year or two,
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.760]   go to one of these three destinations.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.960]   If we cycle through each of them,
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.060]   what's one or two things people should consider adding on,
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.780]   whether it's for the day, for a couple nights,
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.940]   that's nearby to enrich a trip to Riviera Maya,
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.940]   Los Cabos, or Puerto Vallarta?
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.100]   - Bit of a can of worms here.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:29.940]   There's a lot.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.140]   If I could generalize, I'd say make sure,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.820]   even if you're in an all-inclusive hotel,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.020]   which offer great value, and I'm not down on that,
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.920]   but get out of the hotel.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.100]   Get out there.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.420]   There's some must-see type of things.
[00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.620]   If you're going to the Riviera Maya or the Caribbean,
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.900]   you're probably gonna have to see an archeological site
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.620]   if you haven't been, whether it's Chichen Itza
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.380]   or Tulum or Coba.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.420]   But, you know, interact with your driver, with your guide.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.100]   Stop into a local restaurant.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.260]   Try to mix it up with the locals a little bit.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.660]   So I'd say, in general, get out of the hotel,
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.300]   try to interact with the locals,
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.620]   go have a local meal at a local restaurant.
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.900]   Often, taxi drivers are great source,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.640]   and remember to ask them to go to somewhere they would go,
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.740]   not someplace that they want to take you to.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.420]   Tell them that you'll even pay their commission.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.820]   You'd be happy to pay for their honest recommendation
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.580]   and not just someplace they might get a kickback.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.480]   I'd also say, look around, and of course, we're a resource,
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.060]   but look around on the internet or with friends
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.540]   or other resources.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.860]   What are some small towns around where they're staying
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.340]   that they might be able to go in and have a beer at sunset
[00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.140]   or meet the locals or something that wasn't so built up?
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.680]   You know, if you can find a little small town
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.900]   to go have a coffee or a meal or a drink,
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.100]   that's a great opportunity to feel a little bit more
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.860]   of the authentic nature of a destination.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.760]   - So I'll push a little bit on each one,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.580]   maybe one at a time, just to get a couple specific things.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.380]   So someone's going Riviera Maya.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.940]   Let's say they're in Cancun.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.540]   Maybe give them a couple things,
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.940]   whether it's a restaurant, a bar, or a day trip
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:59.660]   that would elevate the trip
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.600]   that they might've otherwise taken.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.580]   And in my case, since I've done this,
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.820]   stayed at the JW Marriott for a while.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.420]   That was 10 years ago.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:08.260]   - Absolutely.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:09.660]   If you're going to the Riviera Maya or the Caribbean,
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.080]   I'd say definitely go visit Puerto Morelos, for example,
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.460]   and just kick around the town and go down to the beach
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.900]   and get a ceviche and try to find that small town feel.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.780]   You know, it used to be Tulum.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.580]   Tulum is now, as I mentioned, a bit overcooked.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.860]   It's still cool, it's still bohemian chic,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.040]   but yeah, it's gotten quite crowded and busy.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.020]   So go to Puerto Morelos,
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.340]   or if you want something totally away from the sea,
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.780]   go over to Valladolid,
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.020]   which was the first capital of the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.140]   That's to the west of Cancun.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.180]   Colonial town in the middle of the peninsula.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.140]   You could actually combine it with a trip to Chichen Itza
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.340]   and just walk around and feel that colonial history
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.660]   that really you don't get
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.260]   if you just stay at the beach resorts.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.340]   That would be the Caribbean.
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.740]   If you go to Puerto Vallarta.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.260]   - Which by the way, my family and I are going
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.900]   the first week of December.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.740]   So have plans, looking to add something on.
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.900]   So this one, I'm like-
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.740]   - To Puerto Vallarta.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.580]   - Yes.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.060]   - Okay, well, I'd ask you if you'd been before,
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.600]   but I'd say take a trip over to Sayulita,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.740]   which is a little town north of Punta de Mita.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.060]   You could also go and get tacos in Piteal,
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.540]   which is a little local part of Puerto Vallarta city.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.100]   Walk the Malecon, which is the seaside promenade at sunset,
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.020]   along with all the other Mexican families and their kids.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.220]   I could go on and on.
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.380]   There's some amazing beach clubs
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.080]   in the south side of the bay.
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.980]   Majahuitas, or there's a whole string of them.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.480]   Casamaraycas that are amazing.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.700]   I think you have to get out on the water in Puerto Vallarta
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.720]   and see that perspective with the mountains
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.980]   and the whole Bay of Banderas.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.540]   So those are a few things that you might consider
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.500]   in Puerto Vallarta.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.980]   And in Los Cabos, I encourage you to go one way
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.300]   or the other up the coast,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.360]   either to Todos Santos, which is on the Pacific side,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.380]   amazing little colonial village, an oasis town,
[00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.100]   a lot of artists and expat surfer vibe,
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.040]   great little restaurants as well.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.660]   You go for a surfing lesson in Los Cerritos Beach.
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.500]   That could be one way.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.940]   Or go the other side of the peninsula,
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.660]   which would be up towards Cabo Pulmo.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.300]   Cabo Pulmo is home to the northern most tropical reef
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.020]   in North America.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.700]   And you can do some incredible snorkeling
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:22.460]   with giant fish balls of mahi and of whitefish.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.300]   And yeah, I think that's a world-class experience.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:29.380]   And also there's some great little cevicherias
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.100]   and marisquerias right there,
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.640]   little seafood restaurants in Cabo Pulmo.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.220]   So again, get out of the main town, get in a car,
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.140]   go take a drive, open your eyes,
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.460]   meet some locals, eat some good food.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.120]   I think that's a good formula for Mexico
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.820]   of getting a bit more of a feel.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.820]   I feel like I'm gonna be a little embarrassed to say this,
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.800]   but I'm gonna do it anyways
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.180]   for the sake of everyone listening.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.780]   They've probably been to Los Cabos, I don't know,
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.620]   plenty of times.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.460]   Many times for a bachelor party 'cause from California,
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.020]   it's the easy option.
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.820]   And we've never spent any time in San Jose del Cabo.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.540]   Is that a huge mistake?
[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:01.980]   - I like San Jose del Cabo.
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.500]   And again, there is a village there.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.900]   There is a town there that was there before tourism.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.540]   You've got colonial architecture, you've got some shops.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.820]   So I absolutely think it's worth a visit,
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.920]   especially you're right there.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.980]   It's not a big investment of time.
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.300]   Go check it out for sure.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.220]   - Okay, last thing before I move outside of the beach is,
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:20.860]   since I actually am going to Puerto Vallarta,
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.000]   we're going with kids, so keep that in mind.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.280]   Maybe we could escape them for a day also.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.460]   But is there a place that my wife and I,
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.980]   if we leave for a day or an hour or two to get a meal,
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.660]   we should be checking out specifically?
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.820]   Since this one, at least for me, is like,
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.660]   yep, I'm gonna go book it, we're gonna go do it.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.740]   I'll report back to the listeners.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.860]   - Here's an even better one.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.200]   You can bring the kids,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.920]   go to a little restaurant called Barracuda.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.800]   They have a couple locations, they're buddies of mine.
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.080]   And the one in the center of Puerto Vallarta,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.960]   so it's Barracuda Centro.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.240]   The reason I say bring the kids,
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   so you've got this beachside restaurant
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.400]   that has wonderful seafood, amazing view,
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.480]   but it's right there on the sand
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.940]   and the kids can run around on the beach.
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.520]   They'll eat their food and then they can run right out there.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.720]   It's safe, you can see them,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.960]   and you guys can hang out and have a margarita.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.600]   And you can even get tables right on the sand there.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.560]   So that could be one.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.560]   Now, if you really wanna leave them behind
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.480]   and you got a little more than a couple hours,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.160]   there's this amazing restaurant called The Ocean Grill.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.080]   You've gotta go over to Boca de Tomatlan,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.400]   or you can actually leave from downtown Vallarta.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.840]   You get a water taxi and you gotta make a reservation.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.520]   They only go by reservations
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.840]   and it's this incredible setting
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.960]   where you're nestled into this cliff
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.520]   on the south side of the bay.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.320]   They don't allow kids
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.200]   and it's just really simple, fresh seafood.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.680]   It's a grill, they throw on the grill
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.040]   either fish, octopus, lobster, shrimp.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.860]   I think they make a little bit of meat as well.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.420]   And it's really a special experience
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.360]   and kind of a time travel, if you will.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.160]   You know, you feel like you've gone back in time
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.780]   and you're in this little tropical paradise
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.680]   with the jungle all around you and the sparkling sea.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.520]   And there's this cool little area you can,
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.840]   if you like to jump off of stuff,
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.760]   you can jump off into the ocean and it's awesome.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.280]   - I feel like nice dinner,
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   jumping in the water is an activity
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.360]   I am interested in.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.200]   My wife would be like, no,
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.800]   I did my hair for this nice dinner.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.720]   We left the kids at home.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.640]   I'm not jumping off,
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.400]   but we are bringing our au pair
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.640]   who's never been to Mexico and she's so excited,
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.240]   which means that we will be able to sneak away
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.520]   for at least one evening.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.280]   So adding that to the docket,
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.780]   we will make that reservation.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.280]   I wanna share some feedback from a listener named Mike
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.480]   who emailed me about our sponsor today, AG1.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.520]   He said he's been taking AG1 every day
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.680]   for the past two years,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.880]   and he's seen great results in his blood work
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.120]   for vitamins and minerals.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.800]   And when he showed it to his doctors,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.200]   they were impressed at the actual ingredients.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.520]   So Mike, thank you for sharing your experience.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.440]   I too am a big fan of AG1,
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.860]   and it's been in my routine for almost two years as well,
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.520]   because just one daily serving
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.440]   gives me the comprehensive foundational nutrition I need
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.360]   and supports energy, focus, strength, and clarity
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.200]   with 75 high quality vitamins, probiotics,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.080]   and whole food sourced ingredients.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.440]   So it can completely replace your multivitamin,
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.160]   probiotics, and more.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.320]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.380]   add a few ice cubes,
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:12.440]   because I think it tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.420]   and head to my office feeling focused
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.720]   and energized for the day,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.120]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.280]   I also love that AG1 is raising the standard
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.360]   for quality in the supplement category
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.020]   with less than one gram of sugar
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.760]   and no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.400]   So if you're looking for a simpler,
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.120]   effective investment in your health,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.620]   try AG1 and get five free AG1 travel packs
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.840]   and a free one year supply of vitamin D
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.480]   with your first purchase.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.960]   Go to allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.400]   That's allthehacks.com/AG1.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.240]   Check it out.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.000]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.400]   I get it, life comes at you fast,
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.280]   but trust me, your friends are probably desperate
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.420]   for a good hang.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.480]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.440]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.380]   and let our sponsor, Drizly,
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.320]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.080]   take care of the supplies.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.920]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.760]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.160]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.640]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.700]   that you got through another week.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.800]   With Drizly, you can make hosting easy
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.340]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.120]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:30.200]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.880]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.440]   Drizly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:37.420]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.440]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.280]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.360]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.000]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.480]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.120]   So whatever the occasion,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.400]   download the Drizly app or go to drizly.com.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.640]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.560]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.040]   and supporting the show.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.880]   Your support is what keeps this show going.

[00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.360]   and discounts from our partners,

[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.040]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.640]   Okay, I wanted to go a little deeper
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.280]   on the new things to try while you're in those places,
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.680]   'cause I imagine most people maybe don't do that normally,
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.200]   but a lot of these other destinations,
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.000]   more heritage-focused cities are things
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.620]   that I know a lot of people haven't checked out in Mexico.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.880]   So how would you break down those options?
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.200]   I don't know if you wanna start or end with Mexico City,
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.440]   but you let me know.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.440]   Sure, so Mexico City definitely fits
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:46.220]   in the whole heritage, culture, history category.
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.560]   I think you gotta start and finish with Mexico City.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.600]   Mexico is a very centralized country, right?
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.640]   Everything begins and ends in Mexico City.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.520]   It's a very centralized place in terms of politics,
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.760]   economy, culture.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:04.680]   It is such a fascinating, dynamic city.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.920]   I believe that everybody who likes cities
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.840]   and enjoys traveling in cities should go.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.160]   You've got culture, you've got history,
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.920]   you've got music, you've got cuisine,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.000]   you've got incredible museums.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.440]   The hotel scene is amazing, the bar scene.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.080]   You could spend a long time in Mexico City.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.160]   Not only is it the most important place
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.760]   in modern-day Mexico, but this is where the Mexica,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.320]   which Mexico is named after, they came to Mexico City,
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.900]   they saw an eagle with a snake in its claw on a rock
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.960]   and said, "This is where we're forming our capital."
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   That was Tenochtitlan,
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.640]   that's ancient capital of the Mexica.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:49.080]   And so it's been the most important capital city of Mexico
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.320]   from the very beginning.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.040]   We're talking about thousands of years ago.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.360]   I couldn't recommend it highly enough,
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.120]   and you definitely need inside knowledge
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.680]   to make the most of your time.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.880]   You need a minimum of four days in Mexico City,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.840]   but I think you can easily fill up a week or two,
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.120]   depending on your interests.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.440]   Just doing the highlights takes four days,
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.040]   and those are the top-level highlights.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.840]   And then if you wanna get under the skin a bit
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.800]   and go a little deeper and explore,
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.240]   you need at least a week.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.480]   - Okay, so I'm very curious to see
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.920]   what we may have missed or not missed.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.000]   We went for, I think, five days.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.520]   I'll second everything you said.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.800]   I think for someone in the States
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.320]   looking for an international city
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.360]   to go on an adventure to,
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.680]   I can't think of a better place.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.600]   Like, easy to get to on flights,
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.360]   super affordable, incredible hotels,
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.040]   food, drink, everything.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.640]   So let's talk about some of these highlights,
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.080]   because if someone listening hasn't been to Mexico City,
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.640]   I think it just has to be on the list.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.480]   - And by the way,
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.920]   one other thing I'd mention about Mexico City
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.760]   is one of the greatest thing about not just Mexico City,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.840]   Mexico in general, are the Mexicans.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.680]   I mean, the most hospitable, warm, dynamic people.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.760]   So one of the fascinating things about Mexico City
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.920]   is it's such a big city that it's not a touristy place,
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.000]   right, it's really dominated by Mexicans, right?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.640]   The city is living and breathing
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   and pulsing with Mexicans.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.880]   So you're there, you're not real important,
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.040]   you're just observing and flowing
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.360]   and trying to flow with that city,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.560]   'cause if you're flowing against it,
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.520]   it's the chaos, the traffic, it's a bad scene, right?
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.520]   So that's why you really do well to go with an expert
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.680]   or someone, if you're really lucky,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.080]   a friend, or you're an invited guest.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.200]   But if you're not, someone who understands the city
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.800]   and how to get around and how to avoid that chaos.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:34.880]   Now, as far as the highlights,
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.760]   you've got several UNESCO World Heritage sites
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.200]   within Mexico City.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.940]   You've got the historic city center,
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.720]   which has the Metropolitan Cathedral.
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.740]   It's got the Zocalo, which is the central square,
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.240]   which is the third largest central square in the world.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.720]   It's got the Templo Mayor,
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:54.000]   which was the Aztec capital archeological site.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.880]   You've got the Palacio de Gobierno,
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.020]   which is the government palace,
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.080]   which has the Diego Rivera murals,
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.640]   which by the way, you can't see right now, unfortunately.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.320]   You've got the Palacio de Bellas Artes,
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.220]   the fine arts center,
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.960]   which has other incredible Orozco murals
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.680]   and other of the great muralists.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   The whole city, they call it the city of palaces,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.180]   because it literally was just lined up
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.020]   with palace after palace during the colonial era,
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.820]   each family trying to outdo the next
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.380]   with the grandeur of these different palaces.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.740]   They now have taken on the function of the Correos,
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.100]   the mail room or the post office.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:30.940]   And then some of them are government offices
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.520]   and some of them are museums.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.060]   So it's an incredible center,
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.340]   really tight, dense historic center
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.780]   with architecture and all the rest.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.100]   Speaking of architecture, you could spend a whole day
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.260]   exploring the architectural riches of Mexico City,
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.940]   including La Gorreta or Barragan.
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:50.860]   These are just incredible world-renowned architects
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.580]   that have their work spread out throughout the city.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.020]   You also have the pyramids, right?
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.740]   Which are the third and fourth largest pyramidal temples
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.820]   in the world.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.340]   They're about 45 minutes outside of Mexico City.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.020]   That's a must do, must see for sure.
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.180]   You've got the south of the city,
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.820]   which includes Coyoacan and San Angel.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:09.780]   This is where Xochimilco is.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.620]   These are very traditional neighborhoods
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.020]   where you can still feel the Mexico City
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.380]   of the '40s and '50s and '60s,
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.260]   before it just got subsumed by this massive metropolis.
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.180]   You've got Spanish colonial architecture.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.900]   You've got cobblestone streets.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.180]   You also have the Saturday Market in San Angel.
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.380]   And then you've got Xochimilco,
[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.300]   which is some of the last remaining
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.220]   preserved Aztec waterways, right?
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.660]   All of Mexico City actually sits on
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.700]   what were basically wetlands and canals,
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.220]   much like Venice, right?
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.700]   So the mode of transport back in the day of the Aztecs,
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.340]   when the Spanish first arrived, was by canoe.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.060]   And Xochimilco is some of the last preserved,
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.860]   traditional floating gardens, the chinampas and the canals.
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.620]   And you can see what that was like.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:59.660]   We also have some access to lesser visited ones.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.580]   The Xochimilco is a very raucous touristy.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.100]   A Saturday or a Sunday there is filled
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.660]   with Mexican families and mariachis
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.420]   and beer slinging vendors.
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.940]   It's a lot of fun, but it's pretty dynamic, let's say.
[00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:15.980]   We've got access to some areas that are not as busy,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.140]   and you can get a little bit more peaceful experience
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.220]   of what those canals were like.
[00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.660]   So that right there, I think I've named enough stuff
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:26.340]   to be three or four full days, right?
[00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.980]   And that's full days.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.980]   You then have the neighborhoods of Condesa and Roma, right?
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.340]   If you wanna go check out the gallery scene and the art
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:35.260]   and just cruise and have a coffee
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.460]   and see the contemporary creative class
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:38.620]   and what's going on there.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.300]   By the way, Mexico City and especially Roma Norte
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.540]   and Condesa have become these international enclaves,
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.260]   especially full of North Americans and Canadians,
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.980]   remote working, global nomads,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.860]   people living and working remotely.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.820]   And you can hear quite a bit of English these days
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.580]   on the streets, it's interesting.
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.460]   And then you've got so many other more subtle things.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.940]   If you're into art or if you're into handicrafts
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.340]   or if you're into museums,
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.580]   we didn't even mention the anthropology museum,
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.700]   all the different museums.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.060]   So you've got a week minimum to make sure
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:15.900]   that you hit all of the great museums, galleries,
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.220]   the highlights that we mentioned, check out Reforma,
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.420]   then the nightlife, the restaurants.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.940]   So there's a lot to do.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.660]   - Yeah, I think we under indexed on museums
[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.820]   and over indexed on food as we often do.
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.220]   You know, we're like, how do we fit four meals in a day?
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.020]   How do we try all the things?
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:37.900]   I was blown away at the quality of the food you get
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.820]   and the price.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.060]   Meals that would be hundreds and hundreds of dollars
[00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.740]   in the U.S. for less than a hundred dollars.
[00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.180]   - And how about the service?
[00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.980]   - It doesn't feel like you're sacrificing anything
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.260]   other than a couple hours on a plane.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.020]   - And trust me, I've thought about it more than once,
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.100]   get on a plane just to get some tacos for lunch.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.620]   I mean, it is that good,
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.540]   but I meant the service is so good and it's so natural.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.380]   And before you even know you need something,
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.540]   it's there in front of you.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:05.740]   The service in Mexico and in Mexico city in particular
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.940]   is phenomenal, it's world-class.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.100]   But don't sell the museum short, right?
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.660]   You've got the Anthro Museum,
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.820]   which you could spend literally days in.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.260]   You've got the Casa Azul,
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.700]   which is Frida Kahlo's childhood home.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.380]   You've got the Dolores Olmedo,
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.540]   if you're interested in Diego and Frida.
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.580]   You've just got all kinds of museums,
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.220]   even within Chapultepec Park.
[00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.180]   There's several other museums, there's nonstop.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:30.980]   You really could spend a week
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.740]   just going through the museums.
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.020]   You know that the Sona Maco,
[00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.020]   which is the largest contemporary art fair in Latin America
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.180]   is held every year in Mexico city.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.460]   And it's fascinating the amount of private collections,
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.740]   which by the way, we can open for people
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:46.740]   who are interested in that
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:48.220]   through the relationships that we have.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.460]   So there's just so much to do.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.460]   - You've mentioned a few things
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.860]   that you guys might have access to.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.060]   And one question that I imagine someone,
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.340]   myself included are wondering is,
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:57.740]   when you work with people to help them plan
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.140]   these amazing trips to Mexico,
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:01.700]   if someone's just looking for really interesting tour
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.940]   for a day in Mexico city,
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.740]   can they reach out to you and do that?
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:07.500]   Or is it more of let's plan the whole thing?
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.820]   - We would love to be able to help everyone
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.660]   with even the littlest tiny bit,
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.900]   but we are a small boutique company.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.060]   We don't have the resources to be able to help you
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.380]   with one day trip here or there.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:20.900]   So we do tend to focus on whole holidays, whole trips.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.780]   But if you catch us in a moment where we're not too busy,
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.820]   we'd be glad to help with whatever you need.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.460]   But in general, we do stay busy, thankfully.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.700]   So it is generally the whole thing, yeah.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:32.780]   - You've gotten so many recommendations
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.380]   that I'm like, these show notes are gonna be long.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.020]   We might even need a second page for them.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.300]   But on the food side,
[00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.060]   if someone's really looking to eat in Mexico city,
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.020]   do you have any favorites to suggest
[00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.460]   either food or drink or both?
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.260]   - Yes, loads.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.020]   And I think that there's an over-focus
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.860]   on kind of the iconic,
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.700]   you've got Pujol and you've got Rosetta
[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.060]   and you've got Gusino Oaxaca
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.980]   and you've got these restaurants
[00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.140]   that people are so focused on that they have to go to.
[00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.220]   But there's a whole world of restaurants
[00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.620]   that you're not sacrificing anything in quality.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.060]   Maybe they haven't done as good marketing wise,
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.500]   but yeah, Contramar and all of these kind
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.420]   of more recognized places are wonderful.
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.260]   They're awesome.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.660]   I'm not taking anything away from them,
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.340]   but it's a real challenge to get in,
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.940]   especially if you're not making your reservations
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.100]   months in advance.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:23.740]   So we pride ourselves on staying up
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:25.500]   on the latest and greatest,
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.940]   and we're happy to share them.
[00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.060]   It doesn't make a lot of sense
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:30.340]   to share them right now out loud
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.540]   because tomorrow they're not good,
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.580]   today they are.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.660]   We don't put them on the website,
[00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.900]   but we have those restaurant recommendations.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.180]   They're very carefully guarded and curated
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:40.740]   and updated constantly.
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:42.140]   And we're glad to share them
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.380]   with those who are planning travel with us.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.620]   - So if someone's not excited about Mexico City,
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   I think you're missing out.
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.060]   But let's talk about this third category
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.820]   of other places in Mexico, not beach,
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.300]   that I think probably go maybe the least noticed
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.860]   by the average North American traveler.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.260]   Talk about some of the ones that you think
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:03.420]   need to be on people's kind of radar for something.
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.620]   - So I'm gonna go just to help myself
[00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:08.620]   organize my thoughts from Northwest to Southeast.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.180]   I think of it geographically.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.260]   I mentioned already Todos Santos,
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.740]   which is this kind of magical town.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.020]   And by the way, the Pueblos Magicos,
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.220]   or Magic Towns, is a program
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.660]   that Mexico's tourism board developed
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:23.140]   to shine a light on some of these lesser visited
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:24.820]   cultural heritage hotspots.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.260]   So check that out, by the way.
[00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.100]   You can search that.
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.300]   We have articles on our blog.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.420]   We'll put that in the trip notes as well
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.020]   that point to some of these different Magic Towns.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.940]   But in addition to Todos Santos,
[00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.140]   don't forget the Valle de Guadalupe,
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.540]   which is the wine producing region in Northern Baja.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.500]   You've got the whole Sierra Cortez side, right,
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:46.380]   that includes Muleje, Loreto, La Paz.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.500]   These are all incredible places in Baja.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.660]   Moving across onto the continent now,
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:51.980]   you've got the Copper Canyon.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.780]   This is a place that, no matter how much I've championed it,
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.180]   it goes unnoticed.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:55:00.700]   It is four times the size of the Grand Canyon
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:01.980]   in the United States, okay?
[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:06.620]   It's composed of seven major canyons and 22 minor canyons.
[00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.060]   And it's like visiting the Grand Canyon 100 years ago.
[00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.580]   There's indigenous people living in the caves
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:14.260]   and on the side of cliffs.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.100]   There's just incredible jaw-dropping landscapes.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.540]   There's amazing opportunities for hiking,
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:23.660]   mountain biking, rock climbing, you name it.
[00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:26.180]   And there's a train that crisscrosses and traverses
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.660]   the whole canyon system called El Chepe.
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.620]   So that's another amazing place.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:34.580]   Los Alamos, which is also up in Sinaloa,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:35.620]   another amazing town.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:38.300]   Now, coming down a bit further down the coast,
[00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.820]   I'd say don't miss Sayulita or San Pancho,
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.940]   which is north of Puerto Vallarta.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.840]   Those are amazing little villages
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.020]   that are really worth visiting.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.300]   You've got tons in the cultural interior, right?
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.260]   Cities like Durango or Zacatecas,
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.860]   Guanajuato, San Miguel Allende.
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.300]   If you think about the Rocky Mountains in the U.S.,
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.780]   they don't stop just because you've got a border with Mexico.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.100]   They continue and the name changes.
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.460]   It's called the Sierra Madre, the Mother Mountains.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:10.700]   And within these mountains
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.940]   exist these beautiful mountain towns.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.060]   So I'm talking about a few of them,
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:16.580]   Guanajuato, San Miguel Allende.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.980]   Mexico City is found in that same mountain range,
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.540]   but going a little bit further south,
[00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:23.260]   you've got Oaxaca, San Cristobal de las Casas
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.580]   down in Chiapas.
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.620]   These are some of the most beautiful,
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:31.860]   lesser visited cultural heritage destinations
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.460]   that you can find in Mexico.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.420]   People travel halfway around the world
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:39.420]   to find cultural richness, history, indigenous culture
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.540]   that they can find right here in Mexico.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.940]   - I feel like there's like 10 trips I could take to Mexico
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.060]   that I haven't really processed before.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:47.260]   Some of them will be repeats.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.740]   I feel like just talking about Mexico City
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.900]   makes me wanna go back.
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.380]   So that's on the docket.
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.500]   Did we miss anything?
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.340]   - So much.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:56.060]   - Obviously we missed so much.
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.540]   - I mean, can we go on?
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.740]   We gotta go on for days here,
[00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.580]   but next time you go to Mexico City,
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:02.180]   go and have a visit to Puebla.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:05.740]   Puebla is two hours south of Mexico City.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.700]   In fact, you can take this little road
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.180]   that goes from Mexico City to Puebla
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.340]   that goes between two volcanoes
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.620]   that are almost 17,000 foot volcanoes,
[00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.380]   Iztaccihuatl and Popocatépetl.
[00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.460]   If you can pronounce those real fast 10 times,
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.940]   I'll give you a free trip there.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:26.060]   But the road is called the Paso de Cortés
[00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:29.740]   because when Hernán Cortés came from the port of Veracruz,
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:30.980]   which is in the Gulf of Mexico,
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:34.100]   he had intel about what was going on in Mexico City
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.620]   and the Aztecs and everything else.
[00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.340]   And he was coming up with La Malinche,
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.980]   which was the traitorous,
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.300]   well, I won't get into that whole story,
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.060]   but he comes up from Veracruz to Puebla
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:46.820]   and then crosses from Cholula into the Valley of Mexico.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.060]   If you get a chance, read the book "Mexico"
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:49.900]   by James Michener.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:53.140]   It gives this incredible account of that journey.
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   It's a little bit of historical non-fission,
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:56.540]   but it's worth reading.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.340]   And it's this little dirt road
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.260]   that goes between the saddle of these volcanoes.
[00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.660]   And as you come down into the Valley of Mexico,
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.420]   you really, it's jaw-dropping.
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:06.620]   And we're talking about you're in pine forest
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.340]   with glaciated volcanoes on either side of you,
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.140]   one of which is very active, by the way.
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.780]   So you gotta check to make sure that it's open
[00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:15.300]   on the day that you decide to go.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.500]   We'll give you some tips to do it,
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.860]   but it's an amazing, amazing way to do it.
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:20.580]   And you go and check out Puebla,
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:23.620]   have more than 360 churches in Puebla,
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:25.620]   got incredible colonial architecture.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.860]   It's the home of Mole.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   And then actually don't go back to Mexico City,
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:30.260]   keep going to Oaxaca.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:31.620]   Have you been to Oaxaca, Chris?
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.460]   - I have not.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.820]   - Yeah, you gotta get to Oaxaca.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.500]   - I had a list of things I wanna discuss.
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:36.660]   The last question was, I was like,
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:38.220]   I don't feel like we've talked about Oaxaca
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:39.820]   and I feel like I keep hearing people
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.140]   have incredible trips.
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.820]   - Yeah, so the two places that I think,
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.300]   Oaxaca is probably more well-known,
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.340]   but Oaxaca and San Cristobal de las Casas
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.900]   are two of the most beautiful mountain towns
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:54.060]   where indigenous pre-Columbian culture is most intact.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.460]   Probably San Cristobal is more so.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:59.140]   Oaxaca has become more popular and more visited,
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.180]   but still really retains its charm.
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:04.580]   So the beauty of Oaxaca is the fact that it has
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:08.460]   this really strong pre-Columbian indigenous cultural roots
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.660]   that are still living on strongly to this day.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.140]   And you've got people,
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.940]   these are Mixtec and Zapotec people
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:20.020]   that are still speaking their native languages.
[00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:21.620]   I mean, they obviously also speak Spanish
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:23.700]   and some of them even speak English.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.860]   And these are artisans and these are farmers
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.620]   and they're people that are producing mezcal,
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.300]   they're producing handicrafts, they're farming the land.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.580]   They're living very much traditional lifestyles
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.340]   that have gone on for centuries.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.980]   And this, as I was mentioning earlier in the show,
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.840]   the indigenous roots, the pre-Columbian culture
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.020]   lives on so strongly that it influences
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:45.060]   everything about it.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.940]   So the food, the dress,
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.060]   they're still wearing traditional clothing.
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:52.500]   They're still living subsistence agricultural lives,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.020]   many of them in the valleys surrounding Oaxaca.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:58.540]   But the influence on the food, the art, the history,
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.740]   the culture is overwhelming.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:05.740]   And really it's hard to find such a pure evolution
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.300]   and a real organic evolution of the indigenous culture
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.500]   into contemporary life.
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.440]   And I think the pride that these people have
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.440]   and the recognition and the celebration
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.480]   of the international community has helped to preserve this
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.440]   and celebrate it and protect it.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.880]   So very much worth a visit.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.680]   But if you really wanna get even more off the beaten path,
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.840]   check out Chiapas, the state of Chiapas
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.560]   and the town of San Cristobal de las Casas
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.760]   and then the lowland jungles
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.360]   where you have one of the most incredible
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.000]   archeological sites, Palenque.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.480]   - And are these places that someone who,
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.960]   let's just assume for this conversation,
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.580]   hasn't planned a trip with you guys,
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.840]   people can just go to?
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:43.680]   - Oh yeah.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.320]   - Do they need to set up tours and guides?
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.400]   Do they just show up?
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.920]   - That's a good question about anywhere, right?
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.800]   How comfortable, how intrepid are you?
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.520]   But yes, there's a Lonely Planet, there's guidebooks,
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.760]   there's public transportation, there's the internet.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.360]   You don't even need this stuff anymore,
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.240]   but I'd gauge it by how intrepid you are
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.800]   and how comfortable you feel navigating
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.080]   lesser visited places where maybe
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.840]   everybody speaks English.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.600]   But certainly with the internet and email
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.400]   and everything else you can set up accommodation
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.280]   and experiences on your own,
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.160]   just depends on your own comfort level.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.360]   - And how much work you wanna do.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.400]   - That's correct.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.040]   - Do you wanna spend hours and hours planning this or not?
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.560]   What experience do you want?
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.960]   There was a window where I remember
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.480]   people asking about safety in Mexico.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.960]   Is that still a concern?
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.880]   Should people be thinking about that at all,
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.720]   planning a trip?
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.840]   - Well, it's funny you should say that.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   I knew that the pandemic was coming to an end
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.320]   when people's questions of concern shifted back
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.600]   from COVID questions to safety and security questions.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.480]   And so it's a constant headwind that we face
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.680]   when planning travel to Mexico.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.200]   Unfortunately, there's this stereotype
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.160]   and people are always asking, is it safe?
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.520]   And will I get sick?
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.360]   That kind of stuff.
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.120]   And honestly, Mexico has come so far
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.240]   from the days of Montezuma's revenge.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.640]   That doesn't mean that you can't get sick
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:01:59.480]   when you travel to Mexico.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.400]   You can get sick when you travel anywhere.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.480]   The first recommendation I'd have is
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.600]   don't drink yourself silly,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.480]   use sunblock and don't get sunburned
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.080]   and don't get dehydrated, right?
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.680]   That's usually the beginning of all of this stuff.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:16.380]   But the whole education and consciousness
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.700]   about water purification and even ice purification,
[01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.000]   you don't have to ask anymore.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.320]   Is the water purified, right?
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.640]   I mean, in tourists, in restaurants,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.920]   locals are not drinking tap water.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.480]   Locals are drinking purified water.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.880]   Locals are drinking purified ice.
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.040]   And in terms of safety and security,
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.940]   look, anywhere you can have issues,
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.700]   the idea is to be in the right place at the right time.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.280]   Mexico is safe in general and it behooves you.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.100]   And it's really your responsibility as a traveler
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.080]   to make sure that you understand what are the safe places.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.360]   I mean, what about parts of Upper Manhattan?
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.860]   What about parts of Chicago and Detroit?
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.800]   I think you said you're in the Bay Area, right?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.480]   There are certainly places in the Bay Area
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.640]   you wouldn't want to be after dark.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.900]   There's parts of LA and San Diego as well.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.080]   So knowing where you should be and where you shouldn't,
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.140]   being well aware of your whereabouts,
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.320]   and those are all kind of recommendations you make
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.280]   for any place you travel in the world.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.480]   Mexico is still a developing country.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:16.600]   So you have to keep your wits about you
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.900]   and be well-educated and aware.
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.060]   Would I recommend to my own mother, my own sister,
[01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:24.720]   my own family to travel just about anywhere in Mexico?
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.560]   I would.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.040]   And if there are places that I would recommend
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.000]   they don't travel, I'd let them know that as well.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.520]   - I always tell people, you read guides online that say,
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.080]   well, this place might not be safe.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.640]   Keep your money in a money belt and all this stuff.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.560]   I always point out that if you go pick up
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.840]   The Lonely Planet for New York, it says a similar thing.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.040]   We don't read guidebooks for our own towns.
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.360]   So we don't realize that the general advice
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.660]   applies everywhere.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:49.280]   Would you say that like a hotel concierge
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.360]   or the person at the front desk is like a good person to ask?
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.400]   - Absolutely.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.420]   - Or how would someone get acquainted
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.720]   with where to and not to go?
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.200]   - Your hotel staff, I think even taxi drivers.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.560]   Official taxi drivers,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.560]   that's another recommendation we always make.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.320]   You don't take just a taxi off the street,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.640]   you get it at the airport, the official taxis,
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.600]   or at the hotel, an official taxi stand.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.680]   But locals don't want visitors getting heard or in trouble.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.720]   So absolutely, I think the concierge, the reception,
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.480]   they're gonna give you good advice as to where,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.000]   what, when, with whom, how to get around
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.480]   and how to keep yourself safe.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.960]   - So you said official taxis.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.480]   What other things just running through the,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.560]   how to get the best optimized trip to Mexico?
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.720]   I'll give one question.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.920]   I always remember my cousin and I were in Puerto Vallarta.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.580]   My grandparents had a timeshare
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.760]   for 20 years in Puerto Vallarta, the Mayan palace,
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.920]   and then they kept upgrading.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.640]   And we were always thinking
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.280]   we wanted to go dune bugging in high school.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.920]   Everyone seemed like they were gonna make 20, 30%.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.060]   And the way it always worked was pay us a 20% down payment
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.860]   and pay the rest when you get there.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.320]   So we had convinced ourselves
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.760]   that if we could just find the source,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.520]   we could avoid the 20%.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.720]   Is that the way it works?
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.960]   What advice do you give someone
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.160]   who's trying to avoid getting taken advantage of in that way?
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.400]   - So I think that you wanna think about it
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.220]   in a different way.
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.060]   What you really want,
[01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.280]   especially when you're going dune bugging,
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   is to find the best operated, safest dune buggies, right?
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.920]   And so you need a trusted source to get you there.
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.160]   Not just someone who wants to make money on you.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.640]   The cost of distribution, right?
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.800]   You know how wholesale and retail works.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:31.680]   The dune buggy guy is focused on running his dune buggies.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.160]   He's not focused on marketing and selling you tours.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.700]   So he has a whole army of people
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.880]   from timeshare salesmen to concierge companies
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.800]   to airport transportation people.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.560]   So I think that the key is working with expert company
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.120]   that is locally based,
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.200]   that has their eyes and ears to the ground,
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.480]   and can really, at the end of the day,
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.240]   everyone has to make their money.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.720]   And if you buy the tour directly from the tour company,
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.520]   you're still gonna pay the retail price,
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.840]   but you just don't know which tour company to buy from.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.800]   So I think using travel professionals
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.360]   who are really experts and have local presence
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.920]   and eyes and ears on the ground, that's my recommendation.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.040]   - And where do the hotels fit into that?
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.080]   Is it find the experts in organizing trips and adventures?
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.480]   Is that over using your hotel as a source?
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.560]   - That's a little tricky.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.040]   I do think in general
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.080]   that hotels want you to have a good experience.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.680]   They want to see you coming back from your tour day
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.480]   with smiles and having had a great time.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.800]   That said, hotels are also incentivized by commission,
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.880]   but I would like to think that in general,
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.440]   they're gonna get a commission from whomever they work with.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.720]   They'd like to work with the people
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.520]   that are gonna return you safe and sound
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.400]   and with a smile on your face.
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.720]   - Anything else we missed that needs to be here?
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.960]   Obviously plenty of things not there.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.360]   Tips for traveling or booking or saving money
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.080]   or anything that kind of falls outside
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.560]   of the general overview?
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.400]   You mentioned money
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.320]   and how to avoid excessive surcharges and commissions.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.520]   I found the best way to get cash
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.160]   is actually using your ATM card.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.360]   Just check before you leave
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.520]   what are the affiliated banks
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.880]   in the country you're going to.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.240]   And in addition, when you take out the money,
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.200]   make sure that you decline their conversion.
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.680]   The ATMs in Mexico, you'll say,
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.560]   "Okay, I want 10,000 pesos."
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.400]   And then they'll say,
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.440]   "Okay, 10,000 pesos equals this much dollars.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.000]   "Do you accept our conversion?"
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.560]   You say, "No."
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.280]   And then your bank will do the conversion
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.920]   at a pre-negotiated rate
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.000]   and you're avoiding another level of commission.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.920]   So that's the way that I would get cash.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.400]   Paying local currency is always better
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.120]   than using dollars where you're gonna get
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.880]   an onerous conversion or exchange rate.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.000]   - And do you need cash?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.120]   Or are we at a place now in Mexico
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.720]   where cards and Apple Pay are--
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.120]   - Cards are ubiquitous.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:47.600]   Cards are widely accepted,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.600]   but it's always good to have a little bit of cash.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.440]   - Cool.
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.240]   In the States, I walk around with a $100 bill
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.920]   folded up inside my wallet, just in case, right?
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.200]   - I carry a hundred, a 20, and a two.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   - Exactly.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.480]   - Cool, this has been great.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.640]   I really appreciate it.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.360]   Where can people go find all of this stuff?
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.920]   We're gonna put lots of links in the show notes,
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.200]   but where can people stay on top
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.240]   of all these great things you're finding?
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.440]   - We have an extensive website, journeymexico.com.
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.440]   We've got all kinds of links to accommodation,
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.920]   to sample itineraries, to best times to travel,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.840]   to different ceremonies and celebrations,
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.400]   different natural migrations, whales, turtles,
[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.320]   all kinds of stuff.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.840]   So yeah, I like to think that we've been told
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.360]   that it's a comprehensive resource.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.960]   You can find that in the trip notes too.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.800]   - Awesome, thank you so much for being here.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.720]   - Thank you, Chris.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.360]   - All right, I don't know about you guys,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.720]   but I am really excited to go to Mexico.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.160]   I already have one trip planned,
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.000]   but I feel like there's a lot more coming in my future.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.400]   So before we wrap, I wanted to dive a little bit
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.320]   into flights and hotels to help make
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.960]   your next trip even better.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.920]   I'm actually gonna do an entire episode
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.840]   sometime in the next six or seven months
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.980]   that includes how to search for flights,
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.360]   how to search for hotels,
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.540]   and get the best deal with points and miles.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.480]   So when I do these country deep dives,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.720]   I'm gonna focus mostly on some unique specific things
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.040]   that are maybe a little different
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.760]   than what you need to do for any trip in general.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.480]   So when I looked into flights,
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:12.680]   first off, Mexico is not that far away
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.120]   for people who live in the US or Canada,
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.240]   and flights can often be pretty cheap.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.800]   So it's a little bit of a different experience
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.980]   than trying to book flights to Iceland or Japan
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.280]   or other places where you have to cross an ocean
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.600]   and you might really value being in business class
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.560]   versus a short flight where economy is just fine.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.800]   That said, I'm gonna hit both of those things.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.680]   And when you're searching for flights,
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.200]   obviously Google Flights is your friend.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.480]   It's a tool I use.
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.960]   But because you're in North America
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.240]   and Southwest flies to Mexico,
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.580]   you'll definitely wanna check the Southwest site as well.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.920]   And make sure you're looking at a couple other airlines,
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.440]   Solaris, Viva Aerobus.
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.680]   They also fly to the US.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.280]   They're not the most obvious.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.800]   But I'm gonna drill in and quickly focus
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.500]   on a few unique things I learned about points and miles
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.760]   just to help you get your searches going.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.400]   So first off, I did a bunch of searches
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.220]   just in October this year
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.960]   to try to get a sense of where you wanna book for.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.760]   So on the SkyTeam side,
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.620]   Aeromexico has a ton of flights to the US.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.800]   And when you're trying to book those flights,
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.600]   I found the best way to do it is through Delta.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.260]   And so if you have Amex points,
[01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.080]   you can transfer directly to Delta.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.480]   That's a great option.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.040]   Not that you can't book those flights on Aeromexico,
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.760]   but they're just gonna be more expensive.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.680]   So for example, I looked at a flight
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.000]   from Chicago to Mexico City,
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.240]   and the flight was $322.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.040]   But on Delta, it was only 10,000 points
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.640]   despite being 30,000 points on Aeromexico,
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.980]   which is as high as three cents per point,
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.080]   which is a great redemption value.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.880]   In business, flights are about $550
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.320]   and 25,000 points on Delta.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.820]   So you could get a little bit lower value,
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.460]   2.2 cents per point,
[01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.660]   but in general, pretty good redemption value.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:49.300]   I know a lot of times we talk about needing to go
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:51.820]   on really far, fancy business class flights
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.660]   to get good value from our points.
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.580]   And I know even more,
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.500]   we talk about Delta being really hard to find any value,
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.420]   but 10,000 points for a $320 flight is an awesome deal
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.700]   if you have some Delta points,
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.120]   or if you have Amex points that you can transfer to Delta.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.700]   Next, I looked at a flight in OneWorld on American
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:09.540]   from Chicago to Cancun.
[01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:12.060]   In economy, that flight was $291.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.140]   And yes, you could book directly with American
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:15.620]   for 20,000 points,
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:18.620]   but you can also book that flight on British Airways
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.460]   for only 11,000 points.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.220]   And British Airways often has transfer bonuses
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.960]   from Chase and Capital One and American Express.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.160]   But even without that, it's great
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.020]   because British Airways is a transfer partner
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.700]   of almost every single major card program.
[01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.460]   And so you can get obvious points very easily.
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.680]   That ended up being about 2.6 cents per point,
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.660]   which is awesome.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.500]   And the taxes and fees on British Airways domestically
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.460]   or within North America are so much better than they are
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.860]   if you're looking to fly internationally.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:51.320]   In business class, flight was $486,
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.260]   and you could do it for 22,000 points on British Airways
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.100]   or 30,000 points on American.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:00.140]   So not quite as good of a value, but not terrible.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.300]   So again, really good values on short-term flights,
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.700]   but knowing which airline to book through
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.980]   is part of the challenge of getting the best deal.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.440]   So SkyTeam, Delta was the best.
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.300]   American, British Airways the best.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.120]   Last, I looked at Star Alliance.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.960]   I looked at a specific flight from Washington, D.C.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.520]   to Cancun and on United, the flight was $200.
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.040]   You could actually get it for as low as 10,000 points
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.880]   as long as you booked on Air Canada.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.000]   It was about 12,000 on United, about 2 cents per point,
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.480]   not too different booking between the two programs.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:33.680]   But when you look at business class, it changed a lot.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.280]   If you booked through Turkish Airways,
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.780]   a flight that was $469 was 15,000 points,
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.780]   Air Canada was 20,000, and United was 35,000.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:44.980]   So you could get a much, much better deal
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.620]   booking on Turkish Airways,
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.700]   and you could get as high as 3 cents per point that way.
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.200]   Not saying you need to use all your points
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.900]   for a first class or business class flight going to Mexico,
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.160]   'cause if you're in North America,
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.640]   the flights are pretty short,
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.180]   but it is worth pointing out that where you search
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.260]   and where you book might be different.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:04.140]   And just because it's a United plane
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:07.340]   doesn't mean United is gonna be the right place to book.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.820]   Also worth noting that taxes and fees
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.980]   across different airlines can be different.
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.820]   So while Air Canada looked like the better option in coach
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.740]   because it was 10,000 versus 12,000 points,
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.140]   the taxes and fees were about twice as high.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.480]   So definitely compare both number of points
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.420]   and taxes and fees on that route.
[01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.060]   A few other things related to flights that are interesting.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:30.540]   Number one, Southwest Companion Pass,
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.500]   if you have a lot of trips to Mexico planned,
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.260]   it can be a really great option.
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.500]   I've talked about this in the past,
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.960]   so you can go to allthehacks.com and search,
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.060]   but in general, if you can manage to,
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.780]   through credit card points or flight points,
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:43.900]   build up enough points,
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.620]   which I think right now is 135,000 on Southwest,
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.480]   whatever year you hit that milestone,
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.900]   you get the Companion Pass that year and the next year.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.900]   And because you can go to Mexico with Southwest,
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.100]   you can get two for one flights for that entire period,
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.380]   which could be as much as almost two years.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.520]   Last cool flight hack, which is very niche,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.300]   if you live in San Diego,
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:05.020]   I only recently learned about this,
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.300]   maybe it is common knowledge for everyone there,
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.780]   but there's actually a border crossing
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.500]   at the Tijuana Airport,
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.980]   where you can drive, park in the US,
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:15.460]   and the Tijuana Airport is literally
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.220]   right on the other side of the border.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.220]   So you can go through cross-border express,
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:23.740]   do all your customs and immigration much, much faster,
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.900]   literally cross a bridge over the border into Mexico,
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:28.380]   into the Tijuana Airport,
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.300]   and then buy domestic flights within Mexico.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.140]   And they are so, so, so much cheaper.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.420]   Not worth it if you need to fly to San Diego
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:39.980]   and then take an Uber or a Lyft between airports,
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:40.820]   probably not a good thing,
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.300]   but if you're already in San Diego
[01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.740]   and you haven't tried that,
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.020]   a friend of mine did that and had a great experience.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.140]   Okay, when it comes to hotels,
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.380]   similarly gonna do a whole episode here,
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.900]   because I think that the strategies
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:53.020]   for each of these episodes,
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.620]   when I talk about a country are pretty much the same.
[01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.700]   So for Mexico, between Hyatt at 59 hotels,
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:02.820]   Marriott at 274, Hilton at 93,
[01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:04.340]   and IHG, I couldn't figure out,
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.780]   but Google Bards says IHG has 524 hotels in Mexico.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:10.260]   I assume that number's wrong,
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:11.740]   but I think the moral of the story is
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.960]   there are hundreds of hotels
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.620]   you can book with points in Mexico.
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.460]   So going through all of them would just be way too much.
[01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.100]   I will highlight a few places
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.300]   that I'm either excited about,
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.500]   have stayed at, or have heard good things.
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.660]   If you're going to Cabo,
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.520]   the Waldorf with Hilton points, I've heard is incredible.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.300]   The Cape with Hyatt points,
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.540]   I've heard is incredible.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.940]   And Solaz, which closed down for a couple of years
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.220]   using Bonvoy points through Marriott,
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.300]   we have stayed at,
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.820]   and I can say that it was really, really great.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.860]   Everything from the pool to the food to the drinks,
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.300]   we had a wonderful time.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.940]   I would definitely go back there.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.220]   If you're going to Punta Mida,
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.180]   the St. Regis and the Conrad both look great.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.580]   I have not been to either.
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.880]   If you're going to Cancun, Riviera Maya,
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:55.900]   the Andaz Mayakoba is one that we've had on our list.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.740]   That entire Mayakoba complex,
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.040]   you can search around a little bit,
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.180]   looks amazing.
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.660]   If you really want to splurge,
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.220]   you can go to the Rosewood Mayakoba,
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.860]   which looks just a level above,
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.380]   but we talk a lot about points,
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.940]   so I haven't been there yet.
[01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:12.340]   I have been to the JW in Cancun on a family trip
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.940]   almost a decade ago,
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:17.060]   and it was a great experience for exactly what you want.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.820]   A really nice JW Marriott hotel,
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:21.340]   pools, beaches, everything.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.900]   It was just good,
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.740]   but there was nothing that really set it out
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.300]   side of craziness for me.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.500]   In Mexico City,
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.920]   we stayed at the St. Regis,
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.480]   super central, fantastic experience,
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:32.600]   really loved it,
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.000]   but Las Alcobas also looks like a cool hotel
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.640]   we might check out next time.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.160]   And then across a couple of different cities in Mexico,
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.760]   I know at least Cancun and Cabo,
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.360]   Hyatt has these two brands,
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.920]   the Zalara and the Ziva,
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.840]   and they're both all-inclusive,
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.120]   and I've heard really great experiences about both.
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.200]   One of them happens to be adults only,
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.280]   so Zalara is all-inclusive adults only,
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.760]   and Ziva is like all-inclusive families.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.540]   Definitely something that I wanna try out on a future trip.
[01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.860]   Ziva's probably the one in our future,
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.980]   but if anyone's had good or bad experiences there,
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:05.980]   let me know.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.700]   Also, I've been fortunate to go to Cabo quite a few times
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:11.140]   for group trips,
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.220]   many bachelor parties in my years,
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:16.080]   and booking villas is also a really great option.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.240]   So just because you can't use points there
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.780]   doesn't mean it's not worth considering.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.860]   Having a big house for a lot of people,
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.560]   we did this also for my family over the holidays
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.860]   a couple of years ago,
[01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:28.320]   you can hire a chef,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.960]   and it just really creates an amazing experience.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.920]   So if anyone needs help with that,
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.480]   I have a bunch of good relationships
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.500]   with some villa companies,
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.840]   happy to connect you there.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.960]   You can just shoot me an email,
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.000]   podcast@allthehacks.com.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.600]   Also for houses,
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.920]   you can use Capital One points or Wyndham points,
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.800]   and Capital One transfers to Wyndham,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.360]   to book vacasas,
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.920]   and you can get as high as two to three cents
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:50.760]   per point there.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.480]   So you can go search online,
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.740]   or I'll put a link in the show notes
[01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.260]   to find the Wyndham to vacasa transfer flow
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.260]   and how it works,
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:17:59.420]   but that's an option.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:00.440]   And then last,
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.140]   I just put together a site
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.340]   that I'd love to share with anyone who's interested,
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.340]   just shoot us an email,
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.080]   podcast@allthehacks.com,
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.320]   to help you use our upgrade program online.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.180]   Alternatively, you can go to allthehacks.com/upgrade,
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.500]   or email upgrade@allthehacks.com.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:17.420]   Alternatively, you can go to allthehacks.com/upgrade
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.020]   and read a little bit more about it.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:21.740]   But we have a site where you can look online
[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.300]   and book all of these five-star properties,
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.540]   not with points,
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.700]   but through the various programs
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.460]   where you get upgrades and perks.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.260]   So for example, in almost all of them,
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.340]   you'll end up getting free breakfast,
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:35.740]   you'll get an upgrade if it's available,
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:37.900]   early check-in, late check-out if it's available,
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.340]   and usually a property credit
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.220]   of somewhere around $100 for your stay there.
[01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:45.220]   Very similar to the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts perks,
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.580]   except it's about 3,000, 4,000.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.620]   And we finally have put together a site
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.900]   so you can use that yourself
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.340]   and do your searching on your own.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.660]   So if you want access to it,
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:56.880]   shoot me an email or go to allthehacks.com/upgrade.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.820]   And then last, I wanna do an episode on this,
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.980]   but I'll do a quick rundown
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.860]   'cause there's a few sites and tools
[01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:04.700]   for booking award rooms with hotels
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:05.780]   that I've noticed recently,
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.860]   and I just wanna do a really quick overview of them.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:11.420]   So first, I've talked about Aways a lot,
[01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:13.720]   and you can go to allthehacks.com/aways
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.580]   to get a special deal there.
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:18.680]   I think Aways is the best tool for a search
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.480]   where you say, I wanna go to Paris,
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:21.740]   and I wanna use my points,
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:24.500]   and I have points in these programs, what should I do?
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.820]   And that is the search that I think they nail,
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.940]   and they do a really fantastic job.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.780]   And usually that's how we're doing our searches,
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.620]   so it's usually my first place to go.
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.420]   However, one of my favorite sites
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.060]   for searching for flight availability is seats.arrow,
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:42.420]   and they just launched in beta rooms.arrow.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:44.220]   And if you go to that site,
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:47.420]   they don't support IHG, but they have Hilton,
[01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:49.720]   they have Hyatt, and they have Marriott.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:53.180]   And it's really good if you're open to anything.
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:55.240]   You're like, I want a really great property,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.380]   I'm flexible where I stay, flexible on my dates especially,
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:02.720]   and they'll show you options across everything.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.660]   So they basically index all the stays at all the hotels
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.220]   and have a big database you can filter on.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.660]   So you really need flexibility there,
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.540]   or you need to enjoy filtering big databases.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.540]   Two other sites, staywithpoints.com and maxmypoint.com,
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.780]   both of them are tools to be able to set alerts
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.100]   and then also find availability at very specific properties.
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.500]   So this is great if you're like,
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:29.460]   I want to stay at the Ventana in Big Sur,
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.100]   and I just wanna see what's happening.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.780]   You can do that same search on aways and rooms.arrow,
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.540]   but this is their sole purpose.
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.300]   But the big thing they do is they allow you to send alerts.
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.700]   So if there's a place you wanna stay
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.740]   and you wanna set up an alert
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.340]   so you get notified when it opens up,
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.580]   you can do that there.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.380]   staywithpoints has a better UI,
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.060]   but when I was looking at a few examples,
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.900]   it seemed that their availability was less accurate,
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.640]   but probably won't let the UI win in that case.
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.740]   And maxmypoint, in my opinion,
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.780]   had a very outdated older UI, but at least worked.
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.800]   And you can get your first alert free
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.960]   and with referral links, you can get more.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.700]   And so if you wanna help me out
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:05.980]   and give me access to these tools,
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.060]   you can use our referral links for any of these,
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.140]   allthehacks.com/seatsarrow,
[01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.380]   allthehacks.com/maxmypoint.
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.260]   And like I said earlier,
[01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.080]   allthehacks.com/aways with a Z.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.460]   So those are some of the tools.
[01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:19.060]   I'll do a much bigger deep dive
[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:21.820]   on how to search for and book hotels with points,
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.140]   but I just wanted to flag those
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.500]   'cause I've been starting to play with them a bit more.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.500]   I think that's it.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.080]   I hope that's super helpful for you guys
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.500]   to plan and book your next trip to Mexico.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.580]   I wanna hear about it because it's awesome
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:37.440]   and I might actually partner with every person
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.420]   I do one of these country episodes on
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.900]   to plan future All The Hacks trips.
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:45.100]   So the URL is still a little focused on the Iceland trip
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.180]   we're planning for next year,
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:49.820]   but if you go to allthehacks.com/iceland,
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:50.780]   there's a survey there.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.180]   Even if you're not interested in Iceland
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.300]   and you really just wanna go to Mexico or Japan,
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:56.300]   you can go fill that out and let us know.
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.060]   And that's a good opportunity for us
