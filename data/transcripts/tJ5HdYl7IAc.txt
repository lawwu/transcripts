[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   This week, Randy Alcorn joins us on the phone.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.440]   He is the author of the brand new book, Happiness.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.840]   Randy, I want to talk about the enemies of our joy today, the enemies of sin and anxiety.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.400]   Let's start with sin.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   How does sin poison our joy?
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.800]   Well, Martin Luther said, "Sin is pure unhappiness.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.400]   Unhappiness is pure happiness," which is a pretty succinct way to put it.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.520]   And again, Psalm 32, "Happier are those whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.360]   Happy are those to whom the Lord imputes no iniquity."
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   William Whitaker, who was a Puritan and a Cambridge University professor in the 16th
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   century, spoke of sinning away that happiness wherein we were created.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.120]   And that is a very graphic picture, not only of what Adam and Eve did, but what we who
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.400]   are conceived as sinners and have a sin nature, realizing that Christ became sin for us, he
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.960]   who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him, but we still
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.520]   are capable in this life, in this world under the curse, of sinning away happiness.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.040]   And I think this is just such a graphic portrayal of God-granted humanity happiness.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.760]   Likewise, he grants to us in Christ an eternal source of happiness.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   The God who created the universe, who went to the cross redemptively for me, indwells
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.440]   me, intercedes for me, we're more than conquerors through him who loved us, yet we still have
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.040]   this capacity and even inclination to sin away happiness.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.280]   And I think one of the things we've got to do, Tony, is stop making this distinction
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:09.160]   between, "Okay, if you want holiness, come to the church, come to Jesus, and that's where
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.160]   you get holiness."
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.720]   And then we end up preaching messages even that are negative toward happiness sometimes,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.760]   but we leave people the impression, and sometimes we virtually state it directly, that to get
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.480]   happiness, you're going to have to go find that out in the world.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.560]   You know, we get happiness at the barbecue, we get happiness when we go swimming or surfing,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.700]   you know, we get happiness when we hang out with friends or go to a ballgame, but we don't
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.160]   associate happiness with the church, the body of Christ, the ways that we should.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.680]   We don't associate happiness as David does in the Psalms.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.400]   I mean, take Psalm 119 alone, the numbers of verses that associate time spent in God's
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.920]   Word and delighting in God through his Word that associate all those with these words
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   of happiness and joy, they're just countless.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.240]   Yeah, amen.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.400]   Yeah, we can sin our happiness away, that is so tragic.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.120]   But now let's talk about anxiety.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.280]   How does worry poison our joy?
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.840]   Well, worry is something which involves high stakes and low control is one way to put it,
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.720]   and I think what happens is in the process of worry, we are failing to recognize that
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.640]   even though we're not in control, the fact is something better is true, and that is that
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.080]   God is in control.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:47.560]   And the way sin results in worry is it cuts us off from the very one who we are to trust,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:55.120]   and it makes us think in ways where we are in control of our life or must take control
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   of our lives.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.520]   And of course we're supposed to do certain things, but we are to remind ourselves, for
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.400]   instance, that we fantasize so many of our worries and troubles, like the French philosopher
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.080]   who said, "My life has been full of terrible misfortunes, most of which never happen."
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.040]   And that's what happens in worry.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.120]   You know, the Greek word for worry means to divide the mind, and our mind gets divided.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.240]   And the most striking characteristic of worry and the way that it kills joy is through its
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.600]   absolute impotence, you know, because no tornado has ever been stopped, no drought's ever been
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.720]   averted, no plane crash has ever been prevented by worry.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   And so what happens is we pour our time and energy into it, and then if it really did
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.160]   something, I mean, if it did something of any benefit whatsoever, we could at least
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.060]   say, "Well, okay, it was worth all the good that came out of my worry, except no good
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.480]   ever comes out of it."
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.600]   And so Jesus assures us if we put God and His kingdom first, and His sovereignty, He
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   will take care of us.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   He says, "Do not worry about tomorrow.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.840]   Tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.720]   Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.360]   However, I would say this, in context of Matthew 6, He's just called upon the people He's
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.200]   speaking to to be sure that they store up their treasures in heaven, not on earth, to
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.400]   be sure they adopt the right perspective, not the wrong one, the good eye versus the
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   bad eye.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   And then He tells them, "No one can serve two masters.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.960]   You can't serve both God and money."
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.960]   So if you're investing your life in the right treasury, if you're adopting the right perspective,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:47.780]   an eternal perspective, and if you are serving the right master, then He says, "Therefore,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.780]   do not worry."
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.660]   In other words, if we don't have those things true in our lives, we have a great deal to
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.660]   worry about.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.220]   What we need to do then is to repent and turn to God and say, "Help me to focus on You,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.460]   the source of my joy."
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.460]   Amen.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.700]   Randy Elkhorn, thank you for your time today.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.900]   We're talking about Randy's new book, "Happiness, My Pick," for the Book of the Year in 2015
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900]   and tomorrow.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.740]   I'm going to ask Randy, what is the place of feasting and parties in our God-centered
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.740]   joy?
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.220]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke, and I'll see you tomorrow.
