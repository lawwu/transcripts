[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780]   The Weights & Biases platform is THE system of record leveraged by ML practitioners building
[00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.260]   the autonomous vehicles of tomorrow.
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.120]   From perception and prediction models to planning and state estimation, AV teams use the Weights
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.920]   & Biases platform to centralize visibility across experiments, making them more efficient
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.940]   at turning around models as quickly and safely as possible.
[00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.380]   With just a few lines of code, your team will get rich, shareable dashboards which capture
[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.240]   the details of their latest experiments, increasing team collaboration and ensuring every model
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.140]   is reproducible.
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.540]   We know how important rapid experimentation is for teams working on autonomous vehicles.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.860]   Without a streamlined way to save and monitor their work, ML teams can hit costly and lengthy
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.540]   bottlenecks, delaying projects and time to production.
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.420]   Weights & Biases makes it easy to track and understand changes across experiments, from
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.140]   updated hyperparameters to changes in the training data.
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.940]   Now your team can compare and reproduce models, understand results and iterate quickly without
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.020]   worrying about losing vital work.
[00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.900]   Weights & Biases integrates into all of the ML tools and libraries that you already use
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.260]   like PyTorch, TensorFlow, PyTorch Lightning and lots more.
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.300]   Simply add a few lines of code to your training scripts to get started monitoring the health
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.860]   of all of your training runs.
[00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.940]   To help you better understand your model performance, Weights & Biases already supports visualizations
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.540]   of the most common data types used in autonomous vehicle research, from images with segmentation
[00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.980]   masks to 3D point clouds.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.020]   As a single source of truth, the Weights & Biases platform enables visibility across
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.260]   your organization, empowering teams to systematically compare their experiments' metrics and configs
[00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.140]   and collaborate on models and datasets.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140]   Weights & Biases works across your team's ML workflow.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.020]   The data engineer working on annotating street signs can pass the latest dataset in artifacts
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.900]   to the ML practitioners optimizing models with sweeps.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.000]   After training the latest model, the ML practitioners can analyze and share edge cases or low-performing
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.780]   classes with the rest of their team using reports and tables.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.240]   Finally, once the model has passed all of your custom requirements, the model registry
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.180]   makes it easy to communicate when the model is ready for production.
[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.660]   Keeping valuable analysis within Matplotlib plots, on Slack messages, or hidden within
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.180]   Jupyter notebooks is a thing of the past.
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.620]   Keeping your data secure is a top priority of Weights & Biases.
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.740]   The platform is easily deployed in private cloud or on-prem clusters and can scale with
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.260]   your needs.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.740]   Join the top autonomous vehicles practitioners and get started using Weights & Biases today.
