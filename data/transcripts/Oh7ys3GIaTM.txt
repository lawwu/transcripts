[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   - What about free will?
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.400]   - Free will is also a nice exercise.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   Free will is an illusion that we AI people are gonna solve.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.280]   - So what do you think, once we solve it,
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.840]   that solution will look like?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.680]   Once we put it in the page.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.720]   - The solution will look like,
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.400]   first of all it will look like a machine.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.040]   A machine that act as though it has free will.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.240]   It communicates with other machines
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.640]   as though they have free will.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.960]   And you wouldn't be able to tell the difference
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.040]   between a machine that does
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.080]   and a machine that doesn't have free will.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.960]   - So the illusion, it propagates the illusion of free will
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.440]   amongst the other machines.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.320]   - And faking it is having it.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600]   Okay, that's what Turing tests are about.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.640]   Faking intelligence is intelligent
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.560]   because it's not easy to fake.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.720]   It's very hard to fake.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.560]   And you can only fake if you have it.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.080]   (laughing)
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.200]   - That's such a beautiful statement.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.440]   (laughing)
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.000]   Yeah, you can't fake it if you don't have it.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200]   (laughing)
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
