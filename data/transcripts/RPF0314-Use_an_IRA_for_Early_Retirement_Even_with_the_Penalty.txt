[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   Many people in this audience are working very diligently to save enough money to retire
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.720]   early.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.120]   Early, meaning before age 59 and a half.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   The challenge is what types of accounts do you use to save for this?
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.520]   After all, if you use an IRA and you take the money out before 59 and a half, you're
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.960]   going to pay a 10% penalty for the privilege of having access to your own money, right?
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.280]   Well, today I'm going to share with you why, even though that is the case, you might still
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   be better off investing through an IRA or 401(k) or 403(b) for early retirement rather
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.240]   than using a non-tax qualified brokerage account.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.060]   Early retirement community, here's a little bit of gift of knowledge that I pass along
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:39.920]   to you today.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.320]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I am your host, your fellow adventurer.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.940]   This is the show where we work every day on strategies and tools and techniques to live
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.060]   a rich life now while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.900]   I hope that little gift of knowledge thing didn't sound arrogant because you know what?
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.180]   I was flat out wrong on this a week ago and today I'm going to tell you why and where
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.140]   I messed up.
[00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.420]   This is most definitely one of those things where I had to get my calculator out, but
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.580]   I realized that I was completely wrong.
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.820]   Now I won't keep you sitting around on pins and needles.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.620]   I'll just tell it to you straight out.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.180]   Did you know that if you are investing through a 401(k) or IRA and if you are taking the
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.280]   income from the account out at an early age, meaning before 59.5, so that you're still
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.460]   subject to the 10% penalty, did you know that even if you're paying the penalty by using
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:57.420]   a 401(k) or an IRA, you can still come out ahead than investing your money after taxes?
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.260]   Now there was one very important caveat in that statement.
[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.100]   To the best that I can figure out, that statement is absolutely true and I'll share with you
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.780]   the math and I'll invite you to try to rebut it or try to prove it for yourself because
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.460]   this was totally new to me as of a week or two ago.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.500]   But the statement was taking out the income from the account.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.140]   Now let me tell you the back story and then we'll get into the math of how this came
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.140]   about.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.140]   On some recent episodes, Q&A episodes of the show, there have been a number of different
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.220]   callers who've talked about how much money to save into taxable accounts as compared
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.660]   to tax qualified accounts.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.620]   The idea is should I put more money in my 401(k) because I get the upfront tax savings
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.440]   of using that account or should I go ahead and invest more money into just a post-tax
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.780]   account so I have more flexibility?
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.780]   This is always a challenge for me to reconcile with.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.140]   One of the regrets that I have from my younger investing life is that I feel as though I
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.460]   put too much money into tax qualified accounts.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.300]   I put too much money into IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, et cetera, and I've been frustrated
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.060]   by not having easy access to that money for my own business and investing purposes.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.780]   I've gone from always saying to start with retirement accounts to swinging the pendulum
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.900]   to where at this point for me in my finances, I'm pretty bearish on the use of tax qualified
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   accounts.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.960]   Now, I cannot – I absolutely cannot contradict the reality of the tax savings.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.360]   It is true.
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.400]   Those tax savings are important.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.420]   I'm not trying to argue with the math of it.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.440]   I'm just simply saying for me, probably for three primary factors, I no longer want
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.020]   to prioritize the use of tax qualified accounts in my own investment – in my own investing
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.020]   plans.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.940]   I'm not excluding the use completely.
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.180]   I'm just saying that for me, I no longer want to prioritize these accounts.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.960]   Now, you might be at a different stage.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.780]   You might be in a different situation where these accounts work beautifully as for people
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.100]   who are employees, who have a high income, who can use these accounts to easily shelter
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.100]   a lot of money from taxes.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.660]   There are a lot of strategies through which you can use Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, SEP IRAs,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.820]   all of these things for your benefits.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.820]   So hear me clearly.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.900]   I'm just simply talking about for me.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.460]   The three major reasons why is number one, a loss of flexibility.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.900]   I've realized that for me, investing through a 401(k), trying to just simply buy mutual
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.180]   funds is probably the least effective, least flexible approach to building wealth.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.140]   I much prefer to be involved in private business or in other types of investment that I can
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.060]   have more control over.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.780]   So I don't like the loss of flexibility.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.900]   I don't like the loss of privacy that you gain with 401(k)s and IRAs.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.380]   I don't like the fact that every single year, my balance is reported and all that
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.540]   activity is reported to the IRS.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.640]   I also don't love – third factor, I don't love the fact that the rules and the legislation
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.260]   I think will be changing in coming decades.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.500]   Now what those changes will be, I don't know.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.740]   The political pressures to keep things as they are are immense.
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.740]   But the US government is inexorably grinding over the coming decades toward what I perceive
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.180]   to be an inevitable default.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.580]   And so all through that process, there will be a lot of political machinations of people
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.820]   trying to change this, change that, increase tax here, increase tax there, means test this,
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.300]   change this, other benefit, et cetera.
[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.300]   It's going to be a long and difficult political process.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.700]   If you can predict politics accurately, I will have you on the show to tell me how to
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700]   do that.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.700]   I don't know how to do it.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.360]   So I don't really want to play that game.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   But those are the reasons why for me, I don't love investing through these qualified accounts.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.140]   But I have to maintain professionally speaking that these are valuable and the tax savings
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.340]   are valuable.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.420]   So I've done these Q&As in recent shows and I had a listener who had listened to some
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.580]   of those shows and who had emailed me and said to me, "Joshua, hey, I got a question
[00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.860]   for you and I'm wondering why people don't talk about it.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.820]   Listen, I think I'm better off investing through my 401(k) even if I have to pay the
[00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.820]   10 percent penalty."
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:18.820]   Now, I work really hard to answer all the listener email and so this listener, when
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.220]   he sent the note, it sat in my inbox for a few days until I got around to it.
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.820]   Then I finally went ahead and wrote him a response and I carefully read his email and
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.420]   carefully wrote a response to disabuse him of the notion that somehow the IRA was superior
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.660]   to the Roth IRA and I suggested some past episodes of the show that might help him to
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.100]   establish some theory and so I'm feeling pretty confident.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.060]   I hope I did it in a humble way but I'm supposed to be Mr. Hot Shot expert, right?
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.020]   I mean in theory, I'm supposed to know what I'm talking about.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.980]   At least I've certainly spent enough time studying that this should be the case.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.940]   So I wrote him back this note and I did the calculations for him and I was demonstrating
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:04.260]   to him how IRAs and Roth IRAs are exactly the same and if you have them, the penalty,
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.500]   it's a really bad thing, etc.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.060]   I'm going to go through those calculations in a moment because you need to know them.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.380]   But he wrote me back and said, "No, no, no.
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.380]   You don't understand."
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.940]   So I wrote him back.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.660]   I went back and I read the article on his blog that he linked to.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.900]   He has a blog called Smart Money Better Life and this listener, his name is Brian Rosner,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900]   smartmoneybetterlife.com.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.240]   I'll link to the article where he talked about this in the show notes today.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.700]   And so I wrote him again.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:28.780]   He wrote me back and said, "No, no, no.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.380]   You're still not understanding what I'm saying.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:37.620]   If you only take the income from a 401(k) even if you pay the penalties, you're still
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.300]   better off."
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.100]   And so I realized that he was right.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.780]   I hadn't been understanding what he had said.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.820]   And so I sat down with a calculator and I just started working scenarios and I came
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.800]   to the conclusion that, you know what?
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.820]   He was right and I was wrong.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.860]   I wrote him back and I said, "You were right.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.420]   I got to stress test this and just see if I'm missing anything.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.780]   But to the best that I can figure out, this listener is exactly right."
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.820]   And again, I will go through the math but I'm trying to set the stage here so you understand
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.060]   what I didn't understand initially.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.820]   I sent this over to my buddy, Brandon at Mad Scientist.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:20.600]   Brandon is – I've crowned him the unofficial guru of early retirement math because he writes
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.460]   these great in-depth articles for early retirees and all the specific things.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   So I sent this scenario over to him.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.980]   I said, "Check this out.
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.220]   Have you ever considered this option?"
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.260]   And he took a couple – he thought about it.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.500]   He took a couple of days, made a couple of spreadsheets and we talked about it.
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.660]   He said, "No, I never had.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.100]   It was totally new to me."
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.180]   And it was totally new to – so it was new to Brandon.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.780]   It was new to me as well.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.460]   And I've not seen this discussed widely.
[00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.380]   I'm going to invite you to stress test this.
[00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.660]   To the best of my knowledge and ability, I believe this to be true.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.700]   But I will post in the notes for the show today.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:58.240]   I will post the – my calculations and I invite your commentary on this.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.300]   If you can find a hole in this, if you can find a problem with it, then I invite you
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.600]   to demonstrate that to me so I can set the record straight.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.880]   So in today's show, I'm going to start with the simple calculations, the way that
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   we've done them in the past of comparing Roth contributions and traditional contributions
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   and taxable contributions.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.320]   I'm going to start with that to lay the ground floor and then I'm going to go through
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.400]   the specific calculations and demonstrate to you with numbers why some of you should
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:32.040]   consider using a 401(k) even if it involves you paying the penalty for your access to
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   that early retirement.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.800]   That's through the course of today's show.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.080]   The sponsor of today's show is Trade King.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.200]   Trade King is – the reason I'm – Trade King for today, this is a perfect fit for
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.360]   the type of thing that you could do with Trade King.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.760]   You can fund a 401(k) heavily at work.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.520]   You can fund – I mean you can fund an IRA or a Roth IRA, et cetera, with Trade King.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.600]   But you can fund a 401(k) heavily at work and then you can – upon your exit, you can
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.200]   leave it – you can leave from there and you can transfer it to a brokerage company
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.560]   like Trade King and you can use that to create – to buy the portfolio that you create.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.880]   You can build that portfolio that you only take the income off of it just like we're
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.760]   going to discuss in today's show.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.520]   You can set it up to provide you with a lifestyle and Trade King is one great way for you to
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.800]   do that.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.860]   Many of you prefer to work with a financial advisor.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:28.060]   As a former financial advisor, I think that is a fine course of action and if you want
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.400]   – and many financial advisors will require you to custodian your assets with them and
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.280]   with their firm and there are a lot of advantages and – there are some disadvantages but a
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.080]   lot of advantages and benefits to doing that.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.160]   Many of you will be do-it-yourselfers but you'll work with a mutual fund company,
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.400]   you'll have all of your assets with Vanguard, you have everything with Fidelity, something
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.440]   like that and that works really, really well.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.600]   Some of you prefer to DIY invest.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.400]   That's a minority of the audience but some of you do like to do that.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.660]   You like to trade.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.560]   You like to buy and sell ETFs.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.880]   You like to set up options trades, etc. and that's where you should consider working
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.380]   with a brokerage company.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.720]   Whether you do that with a large amount of your portfolio or whether you do that with
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.800]   just a small side account, you can check that out and you can do that and Trade King would
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.840]   be a great place for you to consider holding your accounts for that purpose.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.720]   If you use the special referral link at TradeKing.com/radical, that's a tracking link.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.740]   It allows them to know how well their ad campaign here on my show is working but it also has
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.740]   some benefit for you.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.480]   So try to bribe you to do it simply by giving you a $100 bonus when you open an account
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.480]   there.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.000]   You need to fund it with a thousand bucks I think and then you need to do I think it's
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.520]   two or three trades within 90 days and then you'll get a $100 bonus.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.200]   So you can find that at TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   So while you're there, make sure you check out their – I hate the word but their RoboAdvisor
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.120]   platform meaning they've put together a portfolio that is carefully constructed and
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.920]   it's competitive with many of the other RoboAdvisor platforms that are out there.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.640]   Too detailed for me to get into at length in the verbal portion of this ad but you can
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.800]   read all that information there on the website.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.480]   TradeKing is really proud of that offering and I think it's a good offering for some
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   types of portfolios.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.880]   So TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.880]   As I go to the math, I want to begin with the math where I – what I had written Brian
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.760]   back and said to him, "Hey, listen.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.880]   No, you're misunderstanding the math here."
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:27.600]   In fact, a few weeks ago, I did a show talking about how the Roth IRA and a traditional IRA
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.200]   actually come out with the absolute identical amounts of money if the assumptions are the
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.760]   same.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.680]   That was episode 303 of the show titled Roth IRA versus traditional, which one pays less
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   taxes?
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:47.940]   What I endeavored to prove in that show was that if you're in the same tax bracket during
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.840]   your working years as you are in retirement and if you're funding an account with the
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:14:01.000]   same amount of money during your working years, you will come out with the exact same amount
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:09.400]   of money whether you use a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA, that it does not matter which type of
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.360]   account you use if your tax rates, tax brackets are the same.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.160]   I did that because there's this often held idea that somehow if you fund a Roth IRA,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.780]   you're going to pay less money in tax simply because you're paying the tax up front.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.920]   That is simply not true.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   If tax brackets and tax rates are the same during your working years and in retirement,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.400]   you're going to pay exactly the same amount of money whether you use a Roth IRA or a traditional
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.400]   IRA.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.360]   Now, I intended that show and that show actually came out of this conversation with Brian in
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.360]   responding to him.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.600]   I said, "This is a good show idea."
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.960]   I regret ever doing that show because all I wanted to do was just simply to demonstrate
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   that one mathematical fact.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.640]   I have received more feedback, more emails, more comments from people saying, "Joshua,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.000]   yeah, but you forgot this.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah, but you forgot that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.560]   Yeah, but you forgot this other thing."
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.120]   All of those things are exactly true.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   It should teach me to ever do a 30-minute one-topic show when I actually need to do
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.440]   a four-hour marathon laying out for you all of the advantages and disadvantages and when
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.800]   you choose one account versus the other.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.200]   I learned my lesson not to short-circuit it because there are many other factors and I
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:27.480]   had lumped those all in under this mysterious other factors point in the show that will
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.200]   affect your decision.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.400]   One of the most valid and most important was simply that if you can pay the tax – let's
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.880]   say if you're going to contribute $5,000 to a traditional IRA or $5,000 to a Roth IRA,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.920]   if you can afford to pay the income tax from other money, what that means is that you can
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:51.360]   actually contribute $5,000 to the Roth IRA, but in effect, you'd only wind up contributing
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.000]   – I'm getting myself all tied up.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   You're in effect contributing more to the Roth IRA if you're paying the tax with other
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   money.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.920]   So the analysis was putting $5,000 into a traditional IRA or earning $5,000, paying
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.240]   – if a 25 percent bracket, you contribute $3,750 to the Roth and you pay $1,250 of tax
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   to the Roth.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.560]   So you're actually contributing less to the Roth, which is why they're equal.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.320]   So that's a valid criticism.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.180]   If you can afford to pay the tax from other money such that you can actually invest the
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.640]   full $5,000, the Roth will come out.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.280]   There are many other valid criticisms.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:31.140]   For example, most people are simply not going to have the same level of income at retirement.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:37.220]   This is one of the reasons why many financial advisors do prefer a traditional IRA for your
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.080]   investing purposes, simply because it's very difficult for you to build enough wealth
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.920]   to be at the same tax rate in retirement as it is during your working lifetime.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:54.780]   If you just consider – I am at and going into one of the more expensive phases of life,
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:17:02.600]   young family, that involves expenses for – higher expenses for housing, expenses for education,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.500]   expenses for food, all these just normal expenses for karate lessons.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.120]   These are the types of things where generally young families spend a very high amount of
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.580]   their – higher amount of income.
[00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.460]   So these years are usually more expensive.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:22.320]   When you take the need for a larger house to maintain children, you take the need for
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.060]   larger cars or more cars to maintain transportation, you go into retirement.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.920]   Most retirees can get by and have a great lifestyle on less dollars simply because of
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   their expenses are lower.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.300]   So that's why it's unlikely that most people are going to be in a higher tax bracket
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.680]   or pay higher tax rates in retirement.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.700]   Now, on the other hand, there are many compelling arguments for the Roth.
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.900]   For example, it's far more flexible.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:53.080]   You can make the argument that when you have a position where your tax rates are low, for
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.380]   example, although my income might be high when I have a young family, I might also have
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.080]   useful extra deductions, nice mortgage interest deduction.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.280]   I might have deductions for child tax credit deductions, etc.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.440]   And so you can make corresponding arguments and that's where you have to sort through
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.800]   these things.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:17.040]   But the intention of Show 303 was simply to disabuse you of the idea that somehow there's
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.260]   just one difference between these two.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.120]   So when Brian first wrote to me, that was my initial response was to say to him – and
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.320]   I'm going to read just a quick moment.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.600]   Let me read a paragraph from his website.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.240]   He says, "I've been listening to your show and I think a lot about the 'how much
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.520]   to put in tax-advantaged accounts' question.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.720]   But I discovered a neat math trick with traditional IRAs.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.440]   Even if you want to prioritize for the now, you can still put money in the traditional
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.640]   IRA and even pull it out and pay the penalty on the earnings and still come out ahead compared
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.640]   to not putting it in at all.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.960]   This is a breakthrough concept because it allows you to have your cake and eat it too."
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.200]   And he linked over to his blog post article about it where I could see it.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.200]   Here's an example.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.040]   He says, "Let's say you're in a marginal tax bracket of 25% federal and 9% state.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.480]   I live in California.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.160]   You have $10,000 at the end of the year.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.360]   What should you do with it?
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.440]   If you invested at 10% – just an example – in an after-tax investment, first you
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.080]   have to pay 34% on it before you get to invest it so you have $6,600 left.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.160]   You invest that at 10% and you get $660 a year.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.920]   You pay tax on that and you get $435 a year to spend on roasting marshmallows on hot lava.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.300]   Okay, let's say you put it in a traditional IRA, the 10K.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.360]   You invest it at 10% and want to use the earnings now.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:38.880]   You get $1,000 in income, pull it out, pay 34% tax plus 10% penalty and you're left
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   with $560.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.080]   So you come out with more income using the IRA income.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.200]   So I responded and said, "Well, hey, it's good if you can leave California," which
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.920]   I want to touch on that at the end of the show, which is a very useful way to take these
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.160]   concepts and increase it.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:04.480]   But the math still comes out exactly ahead and especially if you add in the math of the
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.880]   penalty you come out behind.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.840]   So let me read you two paragraphs because it's important that you understand this distinction
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.880]   between the principle and the income or I should rather say your contribution and the
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.280]   growth because by income, I'm not specifically referring to dividends.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.580]   I'm referring to the growth in the account.
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.040]   So I responded with this mathematical analysis form.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.800]   I said, "A Roth IRA contribution and a traditional IRA contribution come out exactly the same
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.640]   if tax rates are equal."
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.120]   Here's the math for the Roth.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:41.760]   If you earn $10,000 at a 25% effective tax bracket, you pay $2,500 in taxes and invest
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   $7,500.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:50.280]   $7,500 invested today in a lump sum at a 10% annual rate of return for 10 years comes out
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.340]   to be $19,453.07 at the end of the term.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:59.760]   So you have $19,453.07 to spend.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.560]   If you invest through a traditional IRA, you earn $10,000 but invest all of it pre-tax,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.800]   you pay $0 in taxes, meaning you invest $10,000.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.600]   Invest that today in a lump sum, 10% annual rate of return for 10 years and you wind up
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.900]   with $25,937.42 at the end of the term.
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:24.040]   You then pay 25% in taxes, leaving you with $19,453.07 to spend, which is exactly the
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.600]   same as the Roth.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.240]   Now if you add the additional 10% penalty on top of that, you wind up with only $16,859.32.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:36.280]   So you're poorer if you use the traditional IRA option.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   That's where I went in and talked about how even in that situation, you'd be better off
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.840]   with the Roth because you get your first 10% back – excuse me, you get your contribution
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:50.480]   back, the $10,000 back without paying the penalty.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.560]   So he responded back and again, this is where he finally convinced me that I had missed
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.040]   understood him and he talked about the income.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.200]   So let me walk you through the math.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.920]   Again, I will post in the show notes for today's show on the blog and I also – if everything
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.240]   is working okay, I will post this – I believe I can post this as an attachment for those
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   of you who use the Radical Personal Finance app.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.160]   I haven't done this yet but one of the benefits of having the Radical Personal Finance app

[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.840]   I'm going to walk through the numbers because it's important and I'm going to try to
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.040]   do it in a clear way.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.740]   I recognize it's hard to do math in an audible format.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.200]   So let me just tell you the conclusion.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:05.920]   The conclusion is that the traditional IRA wins, that investing through a traditional
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:10.000]   IRA, if you're just spending the income and growth from the account, you're going
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.040]   to wind up with more money to spend even if you have to pay the 10% penalty tax.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.520]   I'll demonstrate that to you.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.680]   I'll link notes and things in the blog post and I invite you to follow the math and the
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.360]   logic there and to see if you can find any error in my thinking.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.840]   But let's go through the scenario.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.200]   So to demonstrate, to try to prove this, I'm going to keep something very simple.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.400]   I'm going to say that there are three aspects to this scenario.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.280]   We're going to assume that we're going to earn and invest $5,000 starting at the
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.360]   age of 30.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.800]   Then that money is going to grow for 10 years.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.440]   So step two is we're going to spend the income from the portfolio at age 40.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.640]   Then we're going to leave the principal, leave the original contribution in the account
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.040]   until the age of 60.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   That's step three.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.000]   At step three, we're going to spend the balance of all of the income and the principal
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.160]   at the age of 60.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.040]   So these numbers are totally arbitrary.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.360]   I'm trying to use round numbers.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.480]   But the idea is at one stage, you're working.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.320]   Some stage a few years later before you can take the money out without penalty, meaning
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.600]   before 59.5, you're going to start spending some of the income and growth from the account.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.600]   Then finally after you've reached 59.5, then you're going to go ahead and spend all of
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   the money.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:35.480]   The question is do you come out better using a traditional IRA, a taxable brokerage account
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.320]   or a Roth IRA given this scenario?
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.680]   That's the major question.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.640]   I want to clarify when I'm using traditional IRA.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:51.600]   The reason this is powerful is because many of you have access to a 401(k) program or
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.480]   a 403(b) program or a SEP IRA that you've established or something in your – a solo
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.140]   401(k), something like that.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.240]   Many of you have access to those types of accounts where you can put much more money
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   in.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.000]   So for example, if I'm in a business with my wife and we set up in our – a 401(k)
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.840]   program, a solo 401(k) program in our company, I can defer – I can set it up such that
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.840]   I can defer up to about $50,000 into this account through the different employee contribution,
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.000]   employer contributions and depending on how I do that.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.440]   I can set the – I can arrange the documents to put $50,000 into that.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.800]   I can do that for me and I can do it for her.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.600]   So some of these traditional accounts, SEP IRA, it's the same thing.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:39.400]   You can put a lot of money into these accounts up front.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's much more useful to many of you who are high-income earners than just being able
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.160]   to put a few thousand dollars into a Roth IRA.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.040]   So that's what – why – when I'm using traditional IRA, you should see the power
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.840]   of this of being able to apply it to your 401(k) or other account where you have a much
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.220]   higher ability to contribute to those accounts than just a few thousand dollars.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.520]   So step one, let's start with scenario A, the traditional IRA.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.040]   This is the base scenario that we want to measure against.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:16.200]   So step one, we're going to earn $5,000 and invest it before we pay income tax into
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   the account.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.600]   We're investing the money at age 30.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.160]   So we take $5,000.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.160]   We invest the money pre-tax.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.180]   We now pay no current income tax when we earn the money and we invest it for 10 years.
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.440]   So we put – and I'm assuming throughout, I'm assuming just a 10% annualized rate
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.580]   of return simply for the sake of round numbers.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.580]   You can use five.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.580]   You can use 15.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.580]   It does not matter.
[00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.480]   I like round numbers.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.840]   So N is 10.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.220]   The interest rate is 10.
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.740]   We start with the present value of minus $5,000 because if you're running your calculator,
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.740]   it's a cash outflow.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.220]   So we use a negative number.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.280]   Put in zero contribution, zero payments.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.500]   We solve for the future value.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:59.200]   What we find is that if we invest $5,000 pre-tax for 10 years, at the end of the 10-year term,
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:11.000]   we have a total account value of $12,968.71.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.360]   Now step two, the goal is at age 40, we're going to spend the income from that account.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.020]   So meaning we're going to spend the growth.
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.880]   We're going to leave the original contribution in the account, leave the five grand there,
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.380]   but we're going to spend all the income.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.380]   So we spend the income.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.880]   Let's calculate how much we have to spend.
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:38.000]   Well, if we pull $5,000, our original contribution out of $12,968.71, that leaves us with $7,968.71
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   to spend.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.320]   Now, I'm going to assume that we're in the same tax bracket at that time.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.000]   So we're paying a 25% effective tax rate on our money.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.160]   That means that we're going to pay $1,992.18 of current income tax at a 25% rate.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   I'm also going to assume that we're going to pay a 10% penalty because we're taking
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.360]   the money out at age 40.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.700]   So we're not trying to employ any other strategy that's avoiding the penalty.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.260]   We're just paying the penalty.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:17.440]   That would incur a $796.87 penalty, which means that if you took $7,968.71 out of the
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:27.760]   account, paid a 25% tax and a 10% penalty tax, you now have $5,179.66 to spend.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.920]   Now you leave that pot of money alone and here's where we move into step three.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:39.200]   You leave the $5,000 in the account and you let it grow now for 20 years from age 40 to
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   60.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:47.720]   You have the same constraints, 20 years of time, 10% annual growth rate, present value
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.880]   starts at $5,000, no further contributions to the account.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.320]   That means that at the end of 20 years, you now have $33,637.50 in the account that you
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   can now spend.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:05.680]   Now of course, this is a traditional IRA or a 401(k) or a 403(b), et cetera.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.000]   So meaning that when you take out the $33,637.50, you're going to pay a 25% effective tax rate,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.100]   ordinary income tax.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:25.960]   That means you pay a tax of $8,409.37 of tax, leaving you with $25,228.13 that you can spend
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.740]   on cruises and cocktails on the beach.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.920]   So how much money do we get from this scenario to spend and how much tax do we pay?
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:40.360]   Well, if you add the two amounts of money together to spend, you will wind up with a
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:46.320]   total of $30,407.79 to spend.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:56.360]   That included the $5,179 you were able to spend at the age of 40 plus the $25,228 that
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.240]   you could spend at the age of 60.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.340]   So your total amount of money is $30,407.
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:08.920]   Your total tax paid is $11,198, which included the $19,092 of tax at age 40 plus the $796
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.580]   penalty plus the $8,409 of tax at the age of 60.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.460]   So that's our baseline scenario, the traditional IRA.
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.760]   Now let's compare that to an all-taxable account.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   And so here is where the tax rates possibly could change.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:32.100]   We'll pay and assume the same 25% income tax rate in the beginning, but we could play a
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:39.000]   little bit with scenarios regarding how much money at a 15% long-term capital gains rate
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.640]   if we're paying long-term capital gains taxes, how much money if we're paying ordinary income
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.140]   taxes, or perhaps some of you might even be able to get to a 0% long-term capital gains
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.580]   rate if your earned income is low enough.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.860]   And that's where you got to play with these scenarios a little bit.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.860]   But let's just walk through the simple math.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:59.580]   So scenario B is what if we just take the money out, pay the tax, and we invested ourselves
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.080]   outside of any IRAs or Roth IRAs of any kind?
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.820]   So step one, we're going to earn $5,000 and we're going to invest it.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.440]   We earn it at age 30 and we're going to invest it after paying the tax.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:19.380]   You earn $5,000, pay a 25% income tax, meaning that you're going to pay $1,250 of tax currently,
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.600]   leaving you with $3,750 to invest.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:31.420]   We invest $3,750 from age 30 to 40, totaling 10 years, at a 10% annual rate of return,
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.540]   leaving us with no more contributions to this account, leaving us with a future value at
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.660]   the age of 40 of $9,726.53.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:49.500]   $9,726.53, let's keep our original $3,750 in the account and pull everything out.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:57.960]   If we keep our original $3,750 in the account, we're left with $5,976.53 to spend.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:04.680]   Now here would be the question of what is the appropriate tax rate for us to apply?
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.640]   Do we use a 25% long-term capital gains rate?
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.760]   Do we use a 25% ordinary income rate?
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.380]   Or do we use a 0% long-term capital gains rate?
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.380]   By the way, excuse me, I misspoke.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.160]   I meant to say 20% long-term capital gains rate.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.760]   That's the current brackets, 0, 15, and 20.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.140]   I was looking at my ordinary income rate number.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.120]   So what's the rate that we use?
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:31.520]   For the sake of my example, I'm going to start just simply by using a 15% long-term
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.000]   capital gains rate.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.960]   So we had – we spent our – so we invested the money.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.040]   We took out our $3,750 original capital, which left us with a $5,976.53.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.500]   We're going to pull off a 15% long-term capital gains rate.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.800]   We assumed no taxes year by year over that 10-year period and we're just spending this
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:02.840]   at the end of 10 years, $896.48 of total tax due at a 15% long-term capital gains rate.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:09.180]   That leaves us with $5,080.05 to actually spend on lifestyle.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:16.460]   Now we keep that $3,750 of original capital invested for 20 years, 10% return, etc.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:22.660]   That leaves us with at the end of 20 years, we have $25,228.12 to spend.
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:27.020]   And here again, I'm going to assume that we incurred no taxes during that 20-year period.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:34.260]   We just simply pay the taxes at the end of 20 years, leaving us with a 15% tax bill of
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.260]   $3,784.22.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:48.220]   So we pull that $3,784 from the $25,228, leaving us with $21,443.90 to spend on cruises and
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   cocktails.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.420]   I know the numbers are overwhelming when it's just audio.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.060]   Forgive me.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:34:00.440]   Total in this scenario that I've done using a 15% long-term capital gains rate leaves
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:11.420]   us with a total of $26,523.95 to spend.
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:17.340]   We had $5,080 to spend at the age of 40, and we had $21,443 to spend at the age of 60.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:29.980]   Now to compare that, our scenario A, the traditional IRA, we wound up with $30,407.79 to spend.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:37.020]   Versus here, using a taxable account where we got to pay the tax up front, where we wind
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:43.160]   up with $26,523.95 to spend.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:50.120]   So the traditional IRA was superior to this approach where we had to pay the 25% ordinary
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:56.800]   income tax rate up front and a 15% long-term capital gains tax rate at the end of the term.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.160]   The total taxes paid are very different.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:05.440]   Under this scenario, all taxable, you wind up paying a total of $5,930 of tax, which
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   is less than half or about half of the $11,198 of total tax that you paid with the traditional
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.320]   IRA.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.680]   But you had more money to spend with the traditional IRA.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   Interesting, huh?
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.280]   So what would be the variations?
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:26.720]   Well, first, is that 15% long-term capital gains tax rate going to continue or would
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.080]   that go to a higher rate?
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   I don't know.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.620]   That's where these things get to the point of being unknowable.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.720]   You will have to understand the concept and apply it yourself.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:42.240]   Obviously, if you were paying a higher tax rate, whether you went up to the 20% long-term
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.600]   capital gains tax bracket, which is unusual because that's the highest ordinary income
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:55.400]   tax rate bracket, or if you incurred more long-term capital gains taxes along the way,
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.600]   or if you paid short-term capital gains taxes, or if you incurred ordinary income, all of
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.840]   those things would mean that you would pay more taxes.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.200]   So still, the traditional IRA would come out to be superior.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.040]   Now what I wanted to test was I wanted to see what would be the difference if you paid
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.760]   a 0% long-term capital gains tax rate.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.640]   What would the amount be?
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.200]   That one I think is interesting.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.180]   So same assumptions as I've just gone through.
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.840]   We earned the $5,000.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:28.880]   We pay the taxes up front one time, but then from then on, pretend we never paid taxes
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.440]   on the growth of the portfolio.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:43.840]   Well, under that scenario, you would wind up with a total of $31,204.65 to spend and
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.400]   you pay $1,250 a tax.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.880]   So this would incur the lowest amount of tax, but still, you would have a very comparable
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:57.760]   amount, $31,204.65 to spend under scenario B, all taxable but a 0% long-term capital
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:07.560]   gains rate after you paid that initial amount versus $30,407.79 under scenario A. So the
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:14.760]   difference between those two would be $30,407.79.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.280]   The difference between those two is $796.86.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.520]   So those are very, very comparable.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:27.520]   Now, that was what really surprised me.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:34.360]   Scenario A was a traditional IRA and that involved you spending the income from the
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.600]   portfolio and paying the 10% penalty tax.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.940]   Scenario B doesn't incorporate any penalty tax or any tax after that initial payment
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:50.960]   on income and still, they're very comparable.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.160]   Really, really surprised me.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.240]   I just share it with you as something that you might be interested in.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   There are other permutations.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.400]   As with everything, I'm going to go through the Roth IRA in just a moment and illustrate
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.800]   that one to you as well.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.960]   But I just want to point out to you, there are other scenarios between – let me do
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.060]   the Roth first and I'll come back to the other considerations.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.480]   So the Roth, now that you've got the flow of these steps, one, two, three, you earn
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.480]   $5,000.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.760]   You pay 25% of income tax, meaning leaving you with $3,750 to invest.
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   You invest it for 10 years.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.520]   You wind up with $9,726.53 at the end of 10 years.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.680]   At the age of 40, you want to spend the income from the portfolio.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.260]   Now, here is where you would have some choices with the Roth and I originally worked several
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.560]   variations of how much income to spend.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.680]   Do we spend the same amount of income as the traditional IRA?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.800]   Do we spend the same amount as the alt-taxable account?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.040]   What do we do?
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.460]   For the sake of the three illustrations I want to go on the show, I simply assumed that
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.460]   you spend the income from it.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:57.420]   So you take your total account balance at age 40 of $9,726.53.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:04.360]   You keep your original $3,750 in the account, leaving you with a total of $5,976.53 to spend.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:13.320]   Now, of course, you could take out $3,750 of that money as your return of contribution.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.200]   So that money comes to you tax-free and penalty-free.
[00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.840]   So you take out $3,750.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:24.040]   That leaves you with $2,226 of your distributions that's taxable as ordinary income plus a 10%
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.040]   penalty tax.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.120]   You pay $5,056 of ordinary income plus $2,222 of 10% penalty tax.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   Leaves you with, if you run the math, $5,197 to spend from the Roth at the age of 40.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.180]   You then leave that original $3,750 alone for another 20 years.
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.980]   That grows at 10%.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:49.000]   That leaves you with $25,228 to spend at the age of 60.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.440]   And remember, at that point, you could take it out with no income tax due, which is really
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.640]   nice.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:01.200]   At the age of 60, if you total the amount of income that you have together, you've
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:10.560]   had $30,425.37 to spend and you have $2,029 of total tax.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.280]   Now let's compare that $30,425.37 first against the traditional IRA.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:22.480]   Comes out to be slightly better than the traditional IRA, better to the tune of – what is this?
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.720]   Less than $20.
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.880]   In the Roth IRA, you have $30,425.37 to spend.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:37.680]   In the traditional IRA model that we started from as our baseline, you have $30,407.79.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:47.040]   So you have $17.58 more total income to spend in the Roth IRA.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.440]   One important similarity is you have a very similar number to spend at the age of 40 under
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.700]   those scenarios.
[00:40:52.700 --> 00:41:00.880]   So you have $5,197 to spend at 40 with a Roth and you have $5,179 to spend with a traditional
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   IRA.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   So you still have a very comparable amount of money to spend.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:12.560]   Now the Roth IRA pays much less of total tax, only $2,029.28 of tax as compared to $11,198
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:15.760]   of tax in the traditional IRA, but very comparable.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:21.440]   So the Roth comes out slightly ahead, but very comparable numbers.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.940]   Then if you were to compare the Roth to scenario B, all taxable, the Roth here under those
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.520]   constraints is superior.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.160]   So when comparing the Roth IRA to scenario B under that 15% long-term capital gains tax
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:45.000]   rate, you had $30,425 to spend from the Roth or you had $26,523 to spend from all taxable.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.940]   So the Roth is superior to the tune of about $3,500, $4,000-ish.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:55.220]   So what would be the scenarios that would cause you to – let's get out of the weeds
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.260]   of the numbers and what would be the scenarios that would cause you to choose one over another?
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:05.900]   As with most things, I've not solved anything perfect here because there are a number of
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.900]   things you could do.
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:12.060]   First, with this Roth, remember, I kept this under the constraint of earning and investing
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:18.700]   the $5,000 and paying the tax from those earnings.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.900]   But if you were deciding between the Roth and the traditional, if you had the money
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:28.140]   to pay the tax from another source of funds, then you would be able to get more money in
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.060]   the Roth than the $3,750.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.140]   But remember, you're actually contributing more.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:37.020]   So now we've lost our sense of equilibrium and you can run the math on that.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.140]   It just gets too complicated that I could do on audio.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.240]   Point is there are other scenarios.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.800]   What about the scenario of when you need the money or what about some of the scenarios
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.300]   of when you're going to move?
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:54.260]   That was – those are one of the things that I wanted to demonstrate to Brian is even in
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.580]   my original response.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:03.740]   There are three major tax planning scenarios that I talk about and I've covered them
[00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.420]   in episode 36 and episode 41.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.060]   So they are timing, income timing, income shifting and income conversion.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.020]   So you could use an IRA.
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:19.260]   The great thing about using an IRA or a 401(k) is that you can use this very effectively
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:24.280]   if you're going to implement it as a timing strategy and as a shifting strategy.
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:25.280]   So here's the idea.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.300]   Let's say Brian is working in California.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:34.580]   Putting contributions into his 401(k) allows him to avoid the California – the 9% state
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.780]   income tax that he says that he's paying.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.300]   That's really valuable.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.580]   Now let's say that he works for a decade or two.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.460]   He's avoided paying income tax when he's working really hard, paying at the highest
[00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.720]   marginal tax bracket, having a professional job and he's avoided the California state
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.720]   income tax.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.360]   Now, he takes this traditional IRA concept.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.420]   He funds his 401(k)s with as much money as possible.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.840]   Let's say he's able to structure one of these things where he can put – with total
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.940]   of his contributions and his deferrals, he can put in $50,000 into that.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.980]   Whether that's between just him or whether it's him and his wife or anything like that,
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.220]   he's put $50,000 into that.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.700]   Assume that he does it over a 10-year period of time, that's half a million dollars of
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:22.100]   contributions, all of which have avoided the high marginal tax bracket and have also avoided
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.780]   the high California state income tax.
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.300]   Now after that point in time, he moves to another state.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.520]   He decides he wants to retire.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.260]   He moves to a low state tax – state income tax state or to a no state income tax state,
[00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.720]   refers his place of residence to a low state income tax state and also now he's able
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.640]   to cut his expenses because he doesn't have to live in high cost of living California.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.500]   He can move to a low cost of living state.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.900]   So now he doesn't need to spend as much money.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:55.740]   With that point in time, he starts taking income from his IRA and pretend that IRA through
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:01.220]   investment prowess has grown to become worth a million dollars and he starts taking $30,000
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.420]   a year off of that IRA as income.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:09.180]   Even if he incurs the 10% penalty, well, it's the same as what he would have had to pay
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:13.020]   under the California state income tax rules.
[00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:17.220]   Now he's at a lower marginal bracket because he's only taking $30,000 of income off.
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:24.520]   So essentially in that scenario, essentially he would only be paying the penalty depending
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.900]   on his deductions, etc.
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:33.500]   So that would be a good way of understanding how even this penalty, when you calculate
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.660]   it in, this could be very compelling.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.340]   So I wanted to share this with you because I believe this can be a valuable tool in your
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.340]   tool chest.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:48.300]   First, I invite you to see if there's any flaw in my math or in my illustrations and
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.700]   I mean that sincerely.
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:55.660]   I love – so I'm a huge fan of the concept of the open source community.
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.420]   That's why I try to share this.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.340]   The first thing I did was I said, "Let me do this to Brandon.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:02.780]   Brandon has got a massive platform on the early retirement community and I want to share
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.340]   this with the early retirement community."
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:10.900]   So I expect him to publish an article on this in written form soon and hopefully this show
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:16.180]   will be a good verbal form to help some other people as well.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:20.180]   So we're going to get this out there and look to see if we can find any flaws in it.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.020]   I can't find any flaws in it.
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:27.160]   But the real power of it is going to be when combined in conjunction with some of these
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.860]   other strategies.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:37.000]   This will help many of you who are prioritizing the use of 401(k)s and 403(b)s, et cetera,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.780]   as a primary source of your investment dollars.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.240]   I think this is a really great option.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:48.860]   If you are a highly paid employee and you have a good, well-run 401(k) and if you're
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:51.580]   working hard at your job such that you're not going to have time, you're not going
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.700]   to go start a business on the side necessarily, this can be a really great option for you.
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:02.340]   Under the constraint of only spending income, you can feel confident that you don't have
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:09.540]   to necessarily decrease those contributions in order to prioritize a taxable account versus
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.260]   this 401(k) account.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.260]   That helps a lot.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.100]   I think that will help a lot of you.
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.700]   Now of course remember there are other things.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:23.100]   So in this scenario, I've isolated only the example of which account to use.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.240]   But the reality is there are many other factors.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:31.660]   If you're going to earn a 6% rate of return net of taxes and fees in a 401(k), but if
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:36.140]   you have an opportunity with a side business that you see or some investment that you're
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.460]   going to manage much more actively to earn a 20% rate of return, but you can't invest
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:45.880]   in that type of thing through your 401(k), well, now you're in a much better situation.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.060]   So this is only one variable and I'm repeating this again and again because often people
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.940]   I think take one variable too far.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.100]   You need to look at this in a comprehensive way.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.100]   But I think it's a very useful variable for many of you.
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:05.660]   When you start to put these things together, again, think of Brian, earning income in California,
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:11.260]   high cost of living, high taxes, anything you can do to avoid some of those taxes and
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:16.700]   later be able to move to another place if that's the goal or just to be able to adjust
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:22.420]   the lifestyle in a way, this can be very valuable – a very valuable tool.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.420]   So I hope it's useful to you.
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.460]   I invite you to check it out.
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.020]   I invite you to see if you can find any flaws.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.580]   And for the retirement community, there's a little gift.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.900]   I will link to Brian's original article.
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.020]   Go buy his blog and give him some love, give him some comments and whatnot.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.740]   His blog again is smartmoneybetterlife.com.
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.860]   I did not come up with this idea.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:44.380]   None of us come up with any ideas.
[00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:45.380]   Maybe Brian.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.380]   I don't know.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.380]   Maybe Brian came up with this.
[00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.380]   But I did not come up with this idea.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.660]   I'm just simply helping to give a little bit of publicity here since I have that opportunity
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.100]   and that privilege now to have a platform where I can give good ideas a little bit of
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.100]   publicity.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.100]   So smartmoneybetterlife.com is Brian's blog.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.660]   I think that's basically it.
