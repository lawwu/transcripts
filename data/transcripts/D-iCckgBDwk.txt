[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280]   [music]
[00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.720]   Welcome to the Bogleheads Chapter Series. This episode was jointly hosted by the San Antonio
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.680]   Bogleheads and the Starting Out Life States Chapter and recorded May 20th, 2021. It features
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.240]   Alan Roth, who's also a board member of the Bogle Center for Financial Literacy.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.840]   Bogleheads are investors who follow John Bogle's investing philosophy for attaining financial
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.360]   independence. This recording is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:40.080]   investment advice. And we are now recording. Thank you, Alan, for joining us. A quick,
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:48.640]   quick introduction of Alan Roth. He is the board member and treasurer of the Bogle Center for
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.240]   Financial Literacy. He's the founder of WealthLogic. He's a certified financial accountant,
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.960]   a certified financial planner, and has his master's in business administration.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.680]   He was a corporate finance director for multi-billion dollar companies and author of
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.040]   the book How a Second Grader Beats Wall Street. He's a big advocate for keeping it simple.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.800]   And my favorite, he has the professional goal to never be confused with Jim Cramer.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.080]   I always chuckled at that one. Thanks for joining us, Alan. My pleasure. And thank you,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   guys. You're the ones that do so much work to help so many people across the world. And thank you.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.160]   Thanks, Alan. So the first question is in regards to the Bogle Center. So what are the goals of the
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.960]   Bogle Center for Financial Literacy? And what can we expect to see going forward from that
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.480]   organization? Well, the pandemic, obviously, changed things a whole lot with conferences
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.680]   and the like. But we've been spending a lot of time on mission, vision, values, goals, et cetera.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.040]   And what we want to do is, first of all, more support to the chapters. And I think Gail is
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.800]   doing an amazing job spending an amazing amount of time on this. The conference, we want to get
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.360]   back into having in-person conferences again. It's not going to happen this year, but it will happen
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.240]   next year. And we are going to do more virtual conferences, the speaker series, et cetera.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.680]   We would-- kind of a lofty goal, but we want to develop some tools to help people in different
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.080]   modes of decision relating to the life cycle, spending, saving, spending, et cetera.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   And then finally, just so we can get the word out more, more media exposure. So those are
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   kind of the high-level lofty goals that we would like to do more of. Great.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   All right. Bartz has the next questions. Thank you again, Alan, for joining us tonight.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.440]   John Bogle principles brought us together this evening, so we appreciate that.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.360]   So our question is, what do you consider the basic principles of Boglehead investing?
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   Well, first of all, I mean, John Bogle changed my life.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.480]   I didn't realize how common this was, but I sent him a letter once saying, I'd love to meet you.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.560]   And a week later, got a letter back. I'm coming to Colorado in a few weeks. Let's get together.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   So he has just been an amazing man and mentor. Meeting him was kind of like meeting my favorite
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:54.640]   rock star president, et cetera. But if I had to say what he taught me about investing-- and these
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.480]   are my words. Investing in eight words are minimizing expenses and emotions, maximizing
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.560]   diversification and discipline. It's that simple. When people violate that, they usually do so with
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:19.440]   their own peril. So it really is that simple. And it was very easy, by the way, when my son was
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.640]   eight, because money didn't mean anything to him. The older we get, the more money means to us,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:37.520]   and the harder it is to behave right. But Jack Bogle, I consider him a multibillion-dollar man
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.000]   in how much he saved people, not just at Vanguard, but at other firms that had to copy Vanguard
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:53.280]   to stay competitive. OK, thank you. In some of your writing,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.000]   we've noticed that you've been highly critical of investment advertisers. Can you tell us a little
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.960]   bit about that, your critical stance on investment advertising in general?
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:13.120]   Well, we were kind of joking before this started. I was going to sell an annuity at the end where we
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:22.160]   will give out the chicken dinners and the like. But the more one spends on advertising,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:30.240]   the higher the fees they have to charge. And if you think about it, advertising is all about
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:41.520]   emotions, is all about wanting to get a better value than just the market, et cetera. So for the
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:50.960]   most part, advertising-- I'm very critical of the CFP board, and I am a CFP. The amount of advertising
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   they're doing versus-- it's the opposite strategy of Jack Bogle. Jack Bogle wanted to do the right
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.120]   thing, and people would come. A lot of other firms and the CFP board, in my opinion, are doing the
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   advertising and saying, hey, once we get more people and more money, then we'll lower fees and
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   do things differently. And that's kind of like the 12v1 fee model that failed miserably.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.160]   So I mean, investing should be boring. It really should. And that would make a really lousy ad.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.800]   Thank you.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.640]   Great. And Royce has our next questions.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:49.600]   Hi, Alan. So my first question's a multi-part one. So before we officially started the meeting,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.920]   Miriam had mentioned in your books how you described the second grader portfolio.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:02.240]   Can you describe what that portfolio is and how someone goes about getting a proper
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.840]   stock bond allocation? And then also, is that different in different life stages? For example,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   you had mentioned your son's ad allocation. Has that changed since you wrote the book?
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.080]   Sure. Well, I mean, the basic-- you know, Taylor? Taylor, great minds think alike.
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.880]   So the basic second grader portfolio is Taylor's three-fund portfolio, is a total US and a total
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.280]   international stock index fund. With just those two, you own over 10,000 companies across the
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.480]   planet. And then a total bond index fund, where you own all investment-grade, taxable, fixed-rate
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:56.400]   US bonds. So it's pretty much that simple. When my son was eight, we had him at 90%. He's gotten
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.120]   a little bit more conservative now. He's 23, living out on his own in Madison, Wisconsin.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   And he's starting to think about maybe someday buying a house and such. So he wants to take a
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:15.520]   little risk off the table. I'm not a believer in setting asset allocation. There's a couple of--
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:23.600]   100 minus your age, I don't believe in that. There's a risk profile questionnaire. And Jason
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.440]   Zweig, who's one of the three people I blame the most for getting me into writing, he and I have a
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:35.120]   disagreement. He says those risk profile questionnaires are worthless. And I say, Jason,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.640]   you're wrong. They're not that good. They're actually dangerous. If you think about it,
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.600]   March 19th of last year, when stocks hit an all-time high, we thought we could take a lot
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:53.120]   of risk. And suddenly, 33 days later, when the market fell 35%, our risk tolerance was very
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:00.560]   different. But the biggest factor is our need to take risk, as Bill Bernstein puts it so eloquently,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.560]   when you've won the game, quit playing. So you could be very young and not have to take much
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:15.440]   risk. You could be very old and need to take some risk. So there's not a cookie-cutter formula.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.000]   And I used to say, if you can't be right, at least be consistent. But now I think consistency
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.760]   is even more important, changing that asset allocation, moving in and out. I've seen people
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   time the market poorly far more often, probably 99 to 1 timing things poorly, because our emotions
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.320]   fail us when it comes to investing. So I don't have a cookie-cutter sort of answer. It's not 100
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.240]   minus your age. It's not take this risk profile questionnaire. And again, somebody young that
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.960]   might want to be saving up for a house they want to buy in a couple of years, but they want to have
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.840]   some safer money. So it's not that simple, setting the asset allocation. But consistency, consistency,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:08.000]   consistency. Thanks. And in today's market, obviously, the markets change a little bit.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.800]   And today, we have low interest rates. And so more people are thinking, oh, let me add more,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   go higher on my equities. And so what are your thoughts about bonds in a portfolio at the present
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.560]   time? I totally disagree. My wife calls me the most argumentative person on the planet, and I
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.000]   prove her right daily. So I was once young. So when I graduated college, I was 22 years old,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.240]   and I could get, I think it was 12% on a CD. Now, I tell that to clients and people,
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.840]   and they smile. And I say, those actually weren't such good days. Because if you think about it,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.800]   you invest 100,000, you got 12,000 interest. A third of it went to taxes. So you're left with
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:03.120]   about 8,000. And inflation was 13%, 14%. So you lost a lot more of your spending power than you're
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:10.480]   losing today. So I change absolutely nothing when it comes to fixed income. The purpose of fixed
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.640]   income, in my opinion, has never been income. It's been the shock absorber, the stable portion of
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:24.400]   one's portfolio. And I'm very much a believer, whether it's one of the alternative second-grader
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:31.680]   strategies were to use CDs. And I especially like CDs that have easy early withdrawal penalties,
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:38.000]   because if rates do rise, you don't suffer the loss that a bond fund would have. But always,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.160]   always, always keep credit quality high when it comes to fixed income. Don't get greedy. Don't
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:53.280]   try to-- even a corporate bond fund, in my opinion, if you look what happened in March of last year,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:58.960]   liquidity dried up. And yes, the government stepped in and started buying both the
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.080]   corporate bonds and muni bonds, which shocked me, by the way. But there's no guarantee that
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:13.120]   they're going to do it next time. So trying to earn an extra 0.3%, 0.5%, and risking money,
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:21.760]   in my opinion, is not worth it. Great. Thanks, Alan. The next couple of questions
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.440]   will be coming from Donna. Hello, Alan. Thank you for being here tonight.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:36.000]   I have a question about asset allocation. Do you think that cryptocurrency can play a role
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.360]   in a diversified portfolio? And if so, how? I actually just wrote about it for AARP yesterday.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.720]   And people are kind of shocked. Rick Ferries made fun of me in the Bogleheads meeting,
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   that I own Bitcoin. Yes, in 2017, I wrote about it. And I knew nothing about Bitcoin then,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.000]   and I wanted to make sure that what I was writing was accurate, how you go out and buy it. So I
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:12.480]   bought a lousy $200 worth of Bitcoin, which, even with the pullback, is still about a 10x,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.760]   1,000% return. So I actually walked away with a little bit more
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:27.520]   respect for Bitcoin than I thought when I wrote that 2017 article. Because number one, it really
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:33.760]   does disintermediate the banking system. I mean, people can transact with Bitcoin,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   avoiding the bank. When I buy something on Amazon, which is one of the two largest retailers in the
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:51.360]   country, I get 2% cash back. So you know that Amazon is paying more than 2%. So to disintermediate
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:59.680]   that, I think, is a wonderful thing. And finally, I love the fact that there's only a finite amount
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.000]   of Bitcoin out there. That's not true for all cryptocurrencies. Now, I certainly wouldn't tell
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.320]   anyone to even dream about putting more than 2% of their net worth in any cryptocurrency.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   And I think the odds are, in five or 10 years, it's going to be worth a lot less than it is today.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:27.600]   But I could be totally wrong. And I am quite worried, by the way, with all the amount of
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:35.280]   money that we're printing, the fiscal and monetary policy. But that doesn't necessarily-- Japan's
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:43.200]   been doing that for three decades and fighting deflation. I also wouldn't extrapolate one
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.360]   country's experience to what's going to happen here. So I am quite worried.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.880]   And crypto's kind of the digital version of gold.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.200]   Well, it's been quite volatile lately.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:07.920]   Oh, yes. Yeah, it makes gold or precious metals and mining fund is pretty volatile. But that
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.040]   even looks boring compared to crypto and Bitcoin. One tweet from Elon Musk and things change.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:23.840]   Right. One more. Is there a difference between the S&P 500 index fund
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.200]   and the total stock market index fund? And do you prefer one over the other?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:37.600]   Yeah, there is a difference. I actually wrote a piece many years ago, the case against the S&P 500
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:44.800]   index fund. And Kevin Laughlin, who was Jack Bogle's-- I like to call them chief operating
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.880]   officers rather than assistants. And by the way, could he pick some great COOs? I knew
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:58.880]   Kevin Laughlin very well and Mike Nolan very well. And they're just amazing people. But what I was
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:06.080]   writing, the case against the S&P 500 index fund is that it doesn't own the other several thousand
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.560]   companies, few thousand companies. It only makes up 20%. But owning everything is better.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:19.040]   And what I wrote was, not only do you have the more diversification, but whenever a company
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:26.400]   is admitted into the S&P 500, the stock typically goes up in after hours trading because people know
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:32.800]   that all the S&P 500 index funds have to buy it. And then I think this is fairly amazing
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:41.360]   that if you look at what did better last year, a small cap index fund, a mid cap index fund,
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:49.120]   an S&P 500 index fund, which is large cap, or a total stock index fund, one would think that one
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.720]   of the first three had to do better than the total. But actually, the total beat all three
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.040]   by almost a couple of percentage points. Anyone know why?
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:11.120]   One company, Tesla, it wasn't in a small cap, in a mid cap, and it didn't get admitted to the S&P 500
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.040]   until December 21st, almost the end of the year. Owning everything is better. And of course,
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:24.560]   who brought us the total stock index fund? Jack Vogel. And of course, in the note that he wrote
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.720]   me, he said, of course, you're right, but the overall performance is pretty similar. And it's
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:35.200]   true, it is pretty similar. So I'm not one of those that believe in putting everything in small
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.440]   cap, putting everything in value or small cap value, but I don't want to ignore it either.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.520]   So the S&P 500 is going to miss out on small and mid cap.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.400]   Okay, thank you.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:56.640]   Thanks, Alan. A couple other questions that we received from the Vogelheads. What is a safe spot
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:02.720]   for people to put large amounts of cash that they do not want to take investing risks with?
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:12.960]   I don't have a good answer. There's this general belief that cash is a riskless asset.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   But if you think about it, cash is going to be eaten up by inflation year after year after year,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.480]   especially if you're young and have many, many years. There's this old saying that I don't know
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.200]   if it's true, and I'm not going to find out, but they say if you drop a frog into a pot of boiling
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.920]   water, it jumps right out. But if you put it in nice, cool room temperature water and slowly heat
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.080]   it up, it boils to death. Like I said, I don't know if it's true, and no, I have not done that.
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:53.360]   But when stocks plunge, oh, that cash feels warm and cozy. But Lucas, just think if you leave it
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:01.920]   in cash earning 0.01% in the Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund, just think what that purchasing
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.880]   power is going to buy in 30 or 40 years. The one exception might be if you're a federal employee
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:16.160]   and have access to the Thrift Savings Plan, and in particular, the G Fund, which gives you a bond
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:25.840]   return without any risk of principal. That's a wonderful thing. I've joked on federal news radio,
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.040]   will somebody hire me, pay me $1, give me enough time to move my IRA money into the Thrift Savings
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:44.240]   Plan, then you can fire me. It's that good. Great. Let's see. Next question. For the typical
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:53.520]   accumulator, say someone aged 20 to 45, with all or mostly all of their assets in tax-advantaged
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.480]   accounts, what do you think will work best, the second-grader portfolio or low-cost target date
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:09.920]   fund from Vanguard? Well, if all of the assets are in tax-deferred, I think something like a low-cost
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:18.000]   Vanguard target date retirement fund is fine. In fact, the target date funds used to have just
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.680]   the three funds in there. Now, they've added international bonds and a couple of other
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:35.360]   tips and the like. But I think it's just fine for somebody to have a low-cost target date retirement
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.560]   fund if they have all their assets in their tax-deferred. I'm a believer in locating the
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:48.880]   assets. For example, if you look just at my IRA and 401(k) accounts, you'd say, "Wow." Not my
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.920]   traditional, not Roth. You'd say, "Roth is a weenie. He doesn't believe in stocks. He's all
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:59.040]   on fixed income." If you look just at my taxable accounts, you'd say, "Wow, Roth is a big risk
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:06.160]   taker. He's very heavily in stocks." So what I'm trying to do is locate the assets with more tax
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.000]   efficiency, which isn't important if you have everything in a traditional
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.880]   tax-deferred IRA or 401(k). However, if you have a Roth, that's a different matter. You'd rather
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:23.760]   put the stocks in the Roth portion of that tax-advantaged account. As long as it's low-cost,
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.960]   it's fine. The target date funds harness what I think is the most powerful force in the universe,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.240]   inertia. In my book, I said that Albert Einstein called the power of compounding the most
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.880]   powerful force in the universe. Jason's wife told me that there's no way to know for sure,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:52.000]   but that probably isn't true. Great. Let's see. Royce, I think you have the next couple of
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:22:03.840]   questions. Given the variables such as generous employer contributions or the ability of the
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:11.280]   employee to maximize contributions that may influence the decision-making process,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:18.160]   how should an individual decide between traditional and Roth 401(k) contribution options?
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:30.480]   Yeah, well, I invented the Roth. I think the reason to have a Roth, a traditional and
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:38.080]   taxable money, in my opinion, is diversification from what Congress may ultimately do with tax
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:47.200]   laws. I'm a believer in all three. Now, with that said, somebody who's starting out in a lower tax
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.080]   bracket, there I tend to recommend the Roth. Now, any employer contribution is going to go into a
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:04.640]   traditional, but if your tax rate is low, I'd consider, as my son is starting to invest in a
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:13.680]   Roth, because later on, his income will probably go up. I think tax rates will go up, and I'm using
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:18.960]   logic and we're talking politics, and I don't know why I keep making that mistake, since logic and
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:28.240]   politics have little in common. So, I'm a believer overall in having different tax wrappers, and that
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.880]   includes the Roth, the traditional, and the taxable. Now, the Roth is my smallest tax wrapper,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:42.000]   because it's the newest. Did that answer your question? Did you want to know more about the
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.520]   employer match? We can move on, and if people have questions on that at the end, we can address
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:58.000]   those. So, my second question is, with the many financial tools we have out there on the web and
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.920]   elsewhere, what tools do you typically recommend that accumulators use to determine how much to
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:13.280]   save and when they're able to retire? Yeah, you know, I've used a zillion different tools in
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:20.560]   Monte Carlo simulations. I even wrote one for Jack Bogle, you know, obviously many, many years ago.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:26.480]   I think most of the online tools and such, especially the ones coming from the financial
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.880]   institutions, are in la-la land, that they make certain assumptions on returns, and
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.240]   you know, the Monte Carlo model itself can be brilliant, but you put garbage assumptions in,
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:45.760]   and guess what? You get garbage assumptions out. So, I think a much simpler and better way to do
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:54.160]   it is think of wealth in terms of years instead of dollars. So, in other words, if you need $50,000
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   a year to live on, and you have $200,000, you have four years worth of living expenses.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:10.000]   Four years worth of financial freedom, and that, I think, is a better framework. You know, maybe
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.560]   you can assume that it might grow after taxes and inflation, depending upon the allocation,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.080]   at one or two percent a year, but in my opinion, that's a much better way of framing it
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:30.080]   and thinking about the things, and boy, can those fees and taxes take from those returns. But again,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:36.640]   I think of wealth in terms of number of years of financial freedom, rather than dollars. So,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:43.680]   somebody, you know, with a million dollars that needs $50,000 a year to live on has 20 years
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.840]   of financial freedom. Somebody with $10 million that has $5 million that they need to be happy,
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.880]   they're pretty poor, and you can get rich quick, really, by living frugally,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.680]   because by changing that denominator and try to figure out what makes you happy and what doesn't,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:09.120]   and with all the mistakes I've made in my life, I should be brilliant. I still remember as a kid
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.800]   thinking that if I went to the movie, that would be over in two hours, but if I bought something
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:21.680]   with it, like a model airplane, I'd have it forever and ever, and boy, did I have it wrong.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.480]   Jonathan Clements taught me that. It's experiences that bring happiness, not stuff.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:36.560]   All right. Thanks, John. Bart has the next couple of questions.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   Okay. Most of us mobile heads, you know, we've done a pretty good job of saving lives,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   but as we get closer to retirement, is there any spending and withdrawal strategies that we should
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.720]   be taking a look at? Yeah. I've always said that investing
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:04.960]   is simple. I never said taxes were. There is no cookie cutter. You always spend down the
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:12.480]   taxable money first, tax deferred. In general, the Roth is the last money you'd want to spend.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.160]   That's your most valuable money under current tax law, of course, but there are many times,
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.280]   by the way, that especially if you have delayed social security, you haven't hit the RMD,
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:31.920]   you might want to take money out of the tax deferred account and use up that 12% marginal
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:42.080]   tax rate or take some of it and convert it to a Roth, and then finally, you might not want to do
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.840]   any of those because you might be at the 0% federal long-term capital gains rate. You might
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:55.760]   want to harvest, as Mike Piper eloquently puts it, tax gain harvesting. By the way, you don't
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.240]   have to wait 31 days. You could sell VTI or VTSAX and then buy it back immediately and recognize
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.360]   that gain at a 0% federal tax rate. For those of you in Texas, I say with envy in my eyes,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.840]   you have the 0% state tax rate. Donna, is that why you moved?
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:21.680]   Yes, it was part of the reason. Yes, for sure.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:33.360]   There are various strategies on the withdrawal. I would never let that,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.960]   well, I shouldn't say ever, but generally speaking, you don't want to let that 12%
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:45.200]   marginal federal tax rate go to waste. I think the odds are, I reserve the right to be wrong yet
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.720]   again, that tax rates aren't going to go any lower than that.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:57.200]   Speaking of Social Security and stuff that's usually pretty complicated,
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:04.480]   how do you feel about the rule of thumb about postponing Social Security till you're 70 years
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:17.920]   old? Certainly, number one, the best resource by far is Mike Piper's OpenSocialSecurity.com.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.400]   I mean, I hate Mike because he's a lot smarter than me and he's a whole lot nicer than me.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.120]   He gives it away, but it is absolutely brilliant. I mean, I can't describe
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.480]   some of the things in that model like an insurance company. Every other calculator assumes that I'm
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:40.560]   63 years old, I'm going to die in exactly 23 years, whatever,
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:51.840]   but he's using actuarial tables and probabilities. The answer to your question is the only reason,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.200]   well, obviously, if you don't have the money and you're going to live under a bridge, yes,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:02.960]   I would take the money at 62 in that case, but the high, we're talking about a couple,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:12.240]   the person with the highest benefit should almost always wait till age 70. The only exception would
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:19.760]   be if both parties in the couple were in horrible health and had a very, very short life expectancy,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.320]   but even if one was in horrible health and the other was healthy, you would wait till age 70.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   It goes against our emotions because our emotions tell us I've been paying this FICA tax for
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:41.920]   decades. I want to get my money now, so the emotions say to take it immediately. When it
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:48.720]   comes to investing in finance, our emotions typically fail us. If something feels good,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:56.080]   it's usually bad. If something feels bad, it's usually good. Yes, I totally agree, wait till age
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.320]   70 for the higher benefit of a couple, or if you're a single person in good health,
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:09.520]   wait till age 70. Obviously, if you have other assets elsewhere, and I tell people to go ahead.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:18.720]   Bart, let's say you had a $2,000 a month benefit, but if you waited five more years,
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:24.640]   it would grow significantly. I'd say go ahead and spend that $2,000 today because what you're really
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:31.600]   doing is buying an inflation protected deferred annuity. You used to be able to buy those on the
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:39.200]   open market. You can't anymore, but when I priced it, it was like buying it at about a 45% discount.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.680]   Over what you could buy from an insurance company, and guess what? That insurance company
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.440]   is not backed by the US government.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:56.320]   All right, Donna, you have the next couple of questions.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:03.760]   Well, adding to the social security question and Mike Piper's calculator in particular,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.520]   he uses the present value calculation. I was just wondering if you had a recommendation
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.640]   for what interest rate should be used when we're doing the present value calculations
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.880]   for social security or for annuities to evaluate them?
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:31.360]   Well, what Mike uses is a real discount rate, and that is absolutely the thing to do. When I do a
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:40.800]   private pension analysis for somebody, then I use a nominal rate, and that rate can vary. If the
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:47.680]   pension is from the federal government, I use a lower discount rate than if it's a private company,
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:54.480]   especially if the pension is above the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp or isn't backed by the
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:06.320]   Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. I use rates, a very, very long-term bond interest rate in doing
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:13.280]   the discounting. Then I actually, for conservatism, raise it just a little bit because unlike a bond,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.080]   you can't trade it. Once you've made that decision to take the pension, you can't diversify it and
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:32.640]   you can't then change your mind. Okay. New topic, given the change of administration in the White
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:42.800]   House, has that changed any of your thoughts on long-term financial planning, perhaps policy in
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:51.280]   particular? Yeah. First of all, investing, not a bit. I've written pieces, people that lost a lot
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:56.720]   of money making a costly bet against Obama, people that lost a lot of money making a costly bet
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:01.680]   against Trump. When it comes to investing, you have to know something the market doesn't already
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:12.960]   know. When it comes to policy, all we're hearing about change in the estate exemption, changes in
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:23.680]   the long-term capital gains rate, step-up basis, and most of these are for those very, very wealthy,
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:32.320]   the upper 1%. But I've seen more people make mistakes trying to predict what politicians are
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:40.480]   going to do, creating irrevocable trusts so the kids lose out on the step-up basis, etc., thinking
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   that the exemption was going to be a million dollars. They've created an expensive infrastructure
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:57.600]   that they didn't need. I've spoken to Mike Piper a lot about this. Trying to make changes based
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   upon what we think is going to happen is a hard thing to do. The only thing that I was sure of,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:12.560]   I forgot what year it was, that the estate tax exemption became unlimited. I was absolutely
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.720]   sure Congress was not going to let that happen, but yet they did. Trying to predict politicians,
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:28.480]   is a very difficult thing to do. Sure. And neither party wants to work together these days.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:35.520]   I wish they could do something to solve our healthcare where we spend more than twice per
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.840]   capita of any other country on healthcare with the shortest life expectancy of any developed country.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.200]   Great. Thank you, Alan. So that concludes the questions from the San Antonio Bogleheads
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:01.280]   chapter. Next up, we'll have a few questions from the Starting Out Life stage,
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:13.200]   and those will be asked by Miriam. Thank you, Alan. These are for young people who are starting
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:24.080]   out in their investing career or investors of any age who are late starters and realize they have to
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:32.800]   get going. My first question is, when young people get their first job, they often receive
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:41.680]   a big glossy 401k pamphlet. It has dozens of mutual funds. It has columns with 30-day returns,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   5-year returns, 10-year returns, ER percent. What should they do with all that information? How can
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:37:00.640]   they assess that information when all they really want to do is select something and move on with
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.400]   their life? And their HR department, the human resources department cannot help them. They don't
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:13.440]   really know anything about the funds or a portfolio. Good question. There's a whole lot
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   of research that shows that when a company has dozens of funds in their 401k that a large portion
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.240]   of the participants are going to throw up their hands and just say, "I'll put it in cash," which
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:41.920]   is that frog boiling. So they are getting better. There's a lot of default options now where if you
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:49.840]   don't pick anything, it will automatically go to a life cycle fund, a target date retirement fund
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:56.800]   based on your age, which I think is a wonderful thing as long as it's a low cost sort of plan.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   I think it was about seven, eight years ago, a Supreme Court ruling showed that
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:12.080]   the trustees of corporate 401k plans had a fiduciary duty to offer low cost,
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:21.760]   good investments. So the 401ks have gotten so much better over the period of time, offering
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:30.240]   low cost sorts of things. So I would tell people just probably look for starting out a low cost
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.080]   target date retirement fund if they have that. Pick that, ignore the rest of the stuff. Make
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:45.840]   sure that ER, that expense ratio is low. Thank you. My next question is, what is your advice
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:54.320]   for young investors who are so tempted to make more money and jump into GameStop
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:03.600]   and Robinhood adventures? I would tell them to try to get their excitement
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:11.920]   from someplace else other than investing. And it's hard because you hear stories about how much
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:17.840]   your friend made in Bitcoin, how much your other friend made in GameStop and the like,
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.880]   and some of those may be true. Most of them probably aren't, or they're not talking about
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.760]   where they lost money, et cetera. But yeah, I would tell them to try to avoid that.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:39.840]   Get their excitement elsewhere. Like I said, excitement has its place, but not in investing.
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:49.120]   Investing needs to be boring. Thank you. And this is coming from a guy who I knew I was going to get
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:40:00.480]   rich quick when I was 22 years old and put money in gold, which over what, 30 some odd years has
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.920]   barely kept up with inflation. So I doubled my $6,000. Had I heard of Jack Bogle and his S&P 500
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.960]   index fund, instead of making 6,000, any guess how much money I would have made?
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:20.240]   Over a million? Very close to a million, about 700,000.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.680]   Like I said, I ought to be brilliant with as many mistakes as I've made.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:34.720]   So yeah, there's always going to be a Bitcoin, a GameStop, a gold, and I would try to avoid
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.280]   those things, except for maybe a fun little gambling portfolio. That's fine to carve out
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:47.120]   a little bit of money to have fun with. Regarding the issue of paying off student
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:54.480]   loans versus using the money to invest in your retirement accounts, what are the factors you
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.520]   believe are important to consider? And what is your opinion about this? How would you
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.720]   make that decision? How would you advise young people to make that decision?
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:12.640]   Well, I guess the first thing I would say is never, ever, ever miss out on an employer match.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:20.800]   That's free money. So do I like paying off debt? Absolutely. But never miss out on that
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.840]   free money. The one exception might be if you don't plan to stay at the job
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:32.320]   long enough for the employer match to become vested. So that's free money. Never miss out on
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:42.160]   that. Depending upon your tax situation, that debt may or may not be tax deductible. But I consider
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:48.800]   all debt the inverse of a bond. Because a bond, you're lending a bank, our total bond fund,
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   you're lending money to the US government, you're lending money to corporations, et cetera. They're
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:58.960]   paying you principal and interest. Debt, whether it's the mortgage, car, student loan, is just the
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   opposite. So to the extent that you can earn greater than a bond return by paying down debt,
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:12.640]   should go ahead and do that. So depending on how expensive the debt is, whether or not they're
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:19.360]   getting a tax deduction, and whether or not they've contributed enough to their 401(k)
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:29.120]   to get the employer match. My next question is, is there any real value,
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   or should a young investor seriously consider tilting their portfolio to value funds,
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:46.720]   and in particular, small cap value, since they do have a longer investing lifetime ahead of them?
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:56.800]   In my opinion, no. Some people experimented with drugs when they were younger. I experimented with
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:03.520]   DFA. And I think DFA is an amazingly good fund family, dimensional fund advisors.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:13.280]   But one reason I think they are so good, Fama and French, who really popularized the small cap value
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:20.800]   tilted portfolio and dimensional fund advisors and the like, they never said it was a free lunch.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:28.320]   They said it was compensation for taking on more risk. And I also found that the DFA funds were far
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:36.800]   less tax efficient. So on one hand, I don't believe in ignoring small cap. I don't believe
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   in ignoring value. But I also don't believe in overweighting it. And if you think of
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:51.440]   the second grader math, or as Jack Bogle would say, the humble rules of arithmetic,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:58.640]   I think that was his phrase. If one part of the market does better, another part of
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:06.400]   the market has to underperform. And lately, it has been small cap value, until just recently.
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.520]   And we don't know how far that's going to continue. But the fees are forever.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:19.200]   And I'm seeing more and more tilted portfolios mixed with alternative asset classes
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:25.920]   and the like that are worse than, in my opinion, a lower cost Dodge and Cox,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:36.320]   or even American funds, active. So I believe that, for instance, if somebody picked
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:48.720]   a 60/40 DFA portfolio with a small cap value tilt, that that might be equivalent to a 65/35
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:56.480]   market cap weighted Vanguard type of portfolio. And you'd have lower costs and more tax efficiency.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:04.480]   It's a viable active strategy. And if you do it, you've got to stick with it, in my opinion.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.920]   Moving back and forth is a recipe to do worse than both.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:16.800]   Well, when young people look at those graphs, and they see that when I look at those graphs,
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:24.240]   and I see small cap value, just down at the bottom of the graph, for a long period of time,
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:33.040]   for years at a time, you wonder, well, when is it going to make the money? You want to earn some,
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:40.080]   have a return. And if it's not going to do it, and then 10 years later, you get out of it.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.800]   Yeah, well, I mean, there's going to be reversion to the mean. It's not always going to
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.560]   underperform. It's not always going to outperform. And all I could say is, it was about seven years
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.800]   ago, every conference I was at, seemed like every 30, 60 seconds, I was hearing factor tilting,
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:04.480]   smart beta, small cap value, et cetera. And I think that was a warning sign. And by the way,
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:10.160]   I told you I'm not nearly as nice as Mike Piper. If I knew how to beat the market,
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.280]   the last thing I would do is tell you guys, or write about it, I would be rich.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:24.320]   Because even if that small cap value, and I think there is some logic to it, but the more that it's
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.600]   known, the less likely it is to work going forward. So I'm not going to small cap value tilt. I'm not
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:38.800]   going to go with, what's her name? Kathy Wood didn't do the large cap growth either. So I'm
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:48.560]   going to get hit by people on both sides about how stupid I am. I embrace dumb beta.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:58.720]   Thanks for those responses. We have about 10 minutes left. So we'll spend the next 10 minutes
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:05.360]   answering questions from the chat. And at this time, I will be stopping the recording. So thank
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:19.200]   you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
