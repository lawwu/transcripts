[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.180]   Well, we have talked about the hit HBO television show Game of Thrones, specifically about nudity
[00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.200]   in television and film in previous episodes on this podcast.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.800]   But today we talk about drama and comedy and PG shows that seem more harmless and that
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   seem less obviously corrupting.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.640]   It's a question that comes to us from a listener named Blake.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.840]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.640]   My question is when does humor and media become sinful?
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.660]   I'm a little confused about it even from some things that I've read by you.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.760]   Is watching secular comedies like Friends and Seinfeld sinful?
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.360]   I'm rather confused over what is acceptable humor for Christian viewers.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.480]   If it is wrong to watch these shows, please let me know why."
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.560]   Pastor John, what would you say to Blake?
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.360]   The first thing to say here, maybe, is that I've never seen either of those programs,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360]   Friends or Seinfeld.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.200]   I've heard of them, never seen one, which means that my comments, I hope, have the advantage
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.480]   of not being a response to any particular TV show, but rather can be seen as an effort
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:24.920]   to bring biblical reality into view when deciding what we will be entertained by.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.760]   That's my question.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.640]   Another thing I should probably say here, get it off my chest, is that my whole approach
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.600]   toward what Christians view or listen to or are entertained by is not governed mainly
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   by the question, "What's wrong with it?"
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.680]   That seems to me to be a very different approach than the way the New Testament, the way Paul
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.320]   especially, approaches questions of right and wrong that are uncertain.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.480]   I always get the impression that the question, "What's wrong with it?" is rising from
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:22.280]   a heart that is basically governed by a desire to minimize wrong rather than maximize holiness
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.840]   or faith or spiritual power or worship or zeal for the lost or missions or justice.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.240]   So basically what I'm going to do in answer to this question is try to simply reorient
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.200]   our minds about what we should think and feel when it comes to entertainment.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.960]   I could, I suppose, go to particular verses, and they're there for a reason, and point
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.240]   out things that are wrong that you might find in TV programs and therefore avoid, like obscene
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:08.360]   talk, Colossians 3:8, or filthiness or foolish talk or crude joking, Ephesians 5:4.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.760]   But the problem with that approach right now on this podcast is that it's going to leave
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   thousands of Christians right where they are in the immaturity and worldliness of their
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   passions, which is the main issue.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.000]   I think most Christians are so in the grip of the spirit of the age and in the grip of
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.840]   popular culture and popular entertainments that the kind of radical reorientation I'm
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.240]   talking about is almost unthinkable for them.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.040]   So for me to pitch into that mindset a few little warnings from Bible verses that disprove
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.680]   of certain things seems to me almost useless.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.560]   So here's my effort at reorienting our thinking, and it would be a great work of God.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.560]   Not me, it would be a work of a miracle if it happened to a few listeners, and I certainly
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.320]   need it to happen more deeply in my own life as I try to navigate these cultural waters.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:29.260]   What I want to ask is what are you longing for most earnestly and with the greatest passion
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.260]   in your life?
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.600]   What are you longing for?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.200]   Let's just say in your relation to Christ, in your personal walk and relation to Christ.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.040]   What are you longing for?
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.840]   Are you longing for greater intimacy?
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.720]   Are you longing for greater depth?
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.600]   Are you longing for greater power?
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.520]   Are you longing for greater clarity as you see His glory in the Scriptures?
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.080]   Are you longing to hear His voice with greater confidence as you read His Word?
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.820]   Are you longing to discern His will more confidently?
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:16.840]   Are you longing to walk more closely with Him in a real living relationship as a real
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.340]   person?
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.040]   Are you longing for His smile of favor rather than His frowns of discipline?
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.800]   Do you even think in these terms?
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.100]   Do you go to bed with these longings?
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.460]   Do you wake up with these longings governing your life?
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.160]   Do you devote time, perhaps on the Lord's Day, to seek His face in intensifying these
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   longings?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.200]   If not, that's the issue.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   That's the issue.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:54.760]   This is 10,000 times more important than what particular shows you click on.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.180]   This will govern that.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.800]   But if this is missing, if the growing intensification of these longings in your relationship with
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:12.480]   Jesus is missing, no answers will make any difference about your entertainment habits.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.560]   Or let's just pose the question a little differently.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.500]   What are you longing for in your relationship with other people?
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.220]   Do you long to represent Jesus with greater compelling forcefulness?
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.240]   Do you long for a greater love to people and a greater zeal for their salvation?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:40.940]   Do you long to have greater boldness and encouragement from God in your own representation of Christ?
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:47.420]   Do you long to be a means of other people's holiness and purity and power?
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.180]   Do you long to bring the Word of God from your encounter with the risen Christ into
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.200]   the lives of other people with effectiveness?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:04.180]   Do you long for readiness to speak hope-filled words into the face of those who are dying
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.460]   or suffering or entering or coming out of divorces?
[00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.580]   Do you have the aroma of Christ about you, and do you long for it in your conversation
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.100]   with others so that they say, "There's an aroma about you that's different"?
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.900]   Do you long to be able to inspire others by your own example in lives more consistent
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.300]   and deep and satisfying prayer?
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.500]   If not, what's the point of talking about shows?
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.440]   Right or wrong?
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.620]   We don't even have in place the mindset that can make those kinds of judgments possible.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:54.740]   Now, once those kinds of longings are pursued and you have a new passion and you've been
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:04.860]   moved from being nominal, minimalist, get-by, cultural Christian to an authentic, passionate,
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:12.860]   earnest, God-centered, Christ-exalting, Bible-saturated lover of Jesus, then you will begin to ask
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.020]   questions like, "Does this show build up my faith?
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.880]   Does it weaken my faith?
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.540]   Does this show make Christ more clear and precious to me, or does it make things more
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.780]   cloudy and make biblical realities more unreal?
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.740]   Does the show make the Bible and immersion in Scripture and meditation more desirable
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.500]   to my heart or more awkward to find time for?
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:49.860]   Does this show leave me with a disinclination to pray and seek God's face and long for
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.260]   His power?
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:09:00.060]   Does this show dampen my zeal for missions and my desire to see salvation come to the
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.660]   lives of the people around me, not to mention the people in Hollywood?
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:11.440]   Does it leave me with any desire for a great revival in my city to see people brokenhearted
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.180]   for their sin, represented in a lot of these shows?
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:23.700]   Does this show sweeten my experience of corporate worship with God's people and make it more
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.100]   authentic?
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:31.400]   Does this show heighten my sense of desire to be a risk-taker for the cause of justice
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.080]   and the advancement of God's righteous rule?
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.420]   Does it make me want to get on a boat or a plane and go to some hard place and die for
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.220]   Jesus?
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:48.880]   Does this show make me a better, more natural conversationalist about spiritual realities
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.280]   like heaven and hell and the Holy Spirit and the gospel and faith?
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.500]   So that's my response to the question of whether a person should watch any particular show
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.640]   or movie or video.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:11.980]   My calling in the world is to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things, for
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.800]   the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.000]   Spread a passion for the supremacy of God.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.080]   That's what I'm after.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:30.400]   I'm after the kind of passion for His supremacy in everything that functions as a radical
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.760]   litmus test on what I find amusing and entertaining in media.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.280]   Man, that is convicting.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.120]   We need to live out of our calling.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.040]   This is such a helpful reminder.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.520]   Pastor John, thank you for it.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.720]   And at the start of the episode, I said we've addressed onscreen nudity in the past in three
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.680]   different separate episodes in this series.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:57.080]   Those are episodes number 368, 597, and 955.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.200]   Those three episodes addressed Game of Thrones and other topics related to that series.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.800]   Again, those are episodes 368, 597, and 955.
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.880]   We've nearly published 1,100 episodes in the history of this podcast series, and you can
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.400]   search our entire episode archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.680]   And I would encourage all of you to take some time to get familiar with the topics that
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.240]   we've addressed in the past.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.280]   A lot of questions that come in are questions we've directly addressed in the past.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.240]   I would say about 60 to 70% now of the questions that come in, we've already addressed either
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.800]   directly or very closely.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.480]   So be sure to get familiar with the archive.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.200]   You'll also, if you go to that page, you'll see a tab that says Popular, and you can click
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.480]   on it and that will generate a fresh tabulation of the most played episodes of all time, updated
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.040]   every day.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.560]   And at the top of the list, you'll find the episodes that have reaped over 200,000 plays
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   each.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.200]   There's 13 of them.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   You'll want to look at those.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.720]   Click on the tab that says Popular.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.520]   Again, it's DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.960]   Well, we're going to return on Wednesday.
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.600]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and we will see you then.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.200]   Thanks for listening.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   [ End ]
